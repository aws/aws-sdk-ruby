## Installation

The AWS SDK for Ruby is available from RubyGems. With V3 modularization, you
should pick the specific AWS service gems to install.

```ruby
gem 'aws-sdk-s3', '~> 1'
gem 'aws-sdk-ec2', '~> 1'
```

Alternatively, the `aws-sdk` gem contains every available AWS service gem. This
gem is very large; it is recommended to use it only as a quick way to migrate
from V2 or if you depend on many AWS services.

```ruby
gem 'aws-sdk', '~> 3'
```

**Please use a pessimistic version constraint on the major version when
depending on service gems.**

## Configuration

You will need to configure credentials and a region, either in configuration
files or environment variables, to make API calls. It is recommended that you
provide these via your environment. This makes it easier to rotate credentials
and it keeps your secrets out of source control.

The SDK searches the following locations for credentials:

* `ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']` and `ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']`
* The shared credentials ini file at `~/.aws/credentials`
  * Credential options supported in this file are:
    * Static Credentials (`aws_access_key_id`, `aws_secret_access_key`, `aws_session_token`)
    * Assume Role Web Identity Credentials (`web_identity_token_file`, `role_arn`, `source_profile`)
    * Assume Role Credentials (`role_arn`, `source_profile`)
    * Process Credentials (`credential_process`)
  * Unless `ENV['AWS_SDK_CONFIG_OPT_OUT']` is set, the shared configuration ini file at `~/.aws/config` will also be parsed for credentials.
* From an instance profile when running on EC2 or from the ECS credential provider when running in an ECS container with that feature enabled.

**Shared configuration is loaded only a single time, and credentials are provided statically at client creation time. Shared credentials do not refresh.**

The SDK searches the following locations for a region:

* `ENV['AWS_REGION']`
* `ENV['AMAZON_REGION']`
* `ENV['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION']`
* Unless `ENV['AWS_SDK_CONFIG_OPT_OUT']` is set, the shared configuration files (`~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config`) will also be checked for a region selection.

**The region is used to construct an SSL endpoint**. If you need to connect to a non-standard endpoint, you may specify the `:endpoint` option.

### Configuration Options

You can also configure default credentials and the region via the `Aws.config`
hash. The `Aws.config` hash takes precedence over environment variables.

```ruby
require 'aws-sdk-core'

Aws.config.update(
  region: 'us-west-2',
  credentials: Aws::Credentials.new('akid', 'secret')
)
```

Valid region and credentials options are:

* `:region` - A string like `us-west-2`. See [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html) for a list of supported regions by service.
* `:credentials` - An instance of one of the following classes:
  * [`Aws::Credentials`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/Credentials.html)
  * [`Aws::AssumeRoleWebIdentityCredentials`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/AssumeRoleWebIdentityCredentials.html)
  * [`Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/AssumeRoleCredentials.html)
  * [`Aws::SharedCredentials`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/SharedCredentials.html)
  * [`Aws::ProcessCredentials`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/ProcessCredentials.html)
  * [`Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/InstanceProfileCredentials.html)
  * [`Aws::ECSCredentials`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/ECSCredentials.html)
  * [`Aws::CognitoIdentityCredentials`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/CognitoIdentity/CognitoIdentityCredentials.html)

You may also pass configuration options directly to Client and Resource
constructors. These options take precedence over the environment and
`Aws.config` defaults. A `:profile` Client option can also be used to choose a
specific profile defined in your configuration file.

```ruby
# using a credentials object
ec2 = Aws::EC2::Client.new(region: 'us-west-2', credentials: credentials)

# using a profile name
ec2 = Aws::EC2::Client.new(profile: 'my_profile')
```

Please take care to **never commit credentials to source control**. We strongly
recommended loading credentials from an external source.

```ruby
require 'aws-sdk'
require 'json'

creds = JSON.load(File.read('secrets.json'))
Aws.config[:credentials] = Aws::Credentials.new(
  creds['AccessKeyId'],
  creds['SecretAccessKey']
)
```

For more information on how to configure credentials, see the developer guide
for [configuring AWS SDK for Ruby](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/developer-guide/setup-config.html).

## API Clients

Construct a service client to make API calls. Each client provides a 1-to-1
mapping of methods to API operations. Refer to the
[API documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/index.html)
for a complete list of available methods.

```ruby
# list buckets in Amazon S3
s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new
resp = s3.list_buckets
resp.buckets.map(&:name)
#=> ["bucket-1", "bucket-2", ...]
```

API methods accept a hash of additional request parameters and return
structured response data.

```ruby
# list the first two objects in a bucket
resp = s3.list_objects(bucket: 'aws-sdk', max_keys: 2)
resp.contents.each do |object|
  puts "#{object.key} => #{object.etag}"
end
```

### Paging Responses

Many AWS operations limit the number of results returned with each response.
To make it easy to get the next page of results, every AWS response object
is enumerable:

```ruby
# yields one response object per API call made, this will enumerate
# EVERY object in the named bucket
s3.list_objects(bucket:'aws-sdk').each do |response|
  puts response.contents.map(&:key)
end
```

If you prefer to control paging yourself, response objects have helper methods
that control paging:

```ruby
# make a request that returns a truncated response
resp = s3.list_objects(bucket: 'aws-sdk')

resp.last_page? #=> false
resp.next_page? #=> true
resp = resp.next_page # send a request for the next response page
resp = resp.next_page until resp.last_page?
```

### Waiters

Waiters are utility methods that poll for a particular state. To invoke a
waiter, call `#wait_until` on a client:

```ruby
begin
  ec2.wait_until(:instance_running, instance_ids:['i-12345678'])
  puts "instance running"
rescue Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed => error
  puts "failed waiting for instance running: #{error.message}"
end
```

Waiters have sensible default polling intervals and maximum attempts. You can
configure these per call to `#wait_until`. You can also register callbacks
that are triggered before each polling attempt and before waiting.
See the API documentation for more examples and for a list of supported
waiters per service.

## Resource Interfaces

Resource interfaces are object oriented classes that represent actual
resources in AWS. Resource interfaces built on top of API clients and provide
additional functionality.

**Only a few services implement a resource interface. They are defined by hand
in JSON and have limitations. Please use the Client API instead.**

```ruby
s3 = Aws::S3::Resource.new

# reference an existing bucket by name
bucket = s3.bucket('aws-sdk')

# enumerate every object in a bucket
bucket.objects.each do |obj|
  puts "#{obj.key} => #{obj.etag}"
end

# batch operations, delete objects in batches of 1k
bucket.objects(prefix: '/tmp-files/').delete

# single object operations
obj = bucket.object('hello')
obj.put(body:'Hello World!')
obj.etag
obj.delete
```

## REPL - AWS Interactive Console

The `aws-sdk` gem ships with a REPL that provides a simple way to test
the Ruby SDK. You can access the REPL by running `aws-v3.rb` from the command line.

```ruby
$ aws-v3.rb
[1] pry(Aws)> ec2.describe_instances.reservations.first.instances.first
[Aws::EC2::Client 200 0.216615 0 retries] describe_instances()
<struct
 instance_id="i-1234567",
 image_id="ami-7654321",
 state=<struct  code=16, name="running">,
 ...>
```

You can enable HTTP wire logging by setting the verbose flag:

```
$ aws-v3.rb -v
```

In the REPL, every service class has a helper that returns a new client object.
Simply downcase the service module name for the helper:

* `s3` => `#<Aws::S3::Client>`
* `ec2` => `#<Aws::EC2::Client>`
* etc

## Functionality requiring AWS Common Runtime (CRT)

The AWS SDK for Ruby has optional functionality that requires the 
[AWS Common Runtime (CRT)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/common-runtime.html) 
bindings to be included as a dependency with your application. This functionality includes:
* [Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/MultiRegionAccessPoints.html)
* CRC-32c support for [S3 Additional Checksums](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-additional-checksum-algorithms-for-amazon-s3/)

If the required AWS Common Runtime dependency is not installed you will receive an error
indicating that the required dependency is missing to use the associated functionality. To install this dependency follow
the provided [instructions](#installing-the-aws-common-runtime-crt-dependency).

### Installing the AWS Common Runtime (CRT) Dependency
AWS CRT bindings are in developer preview and are available in the
the [aws-crt](https://rubygems.org/gems/aws-crt/) gem.  You can install them
by adding the `aws-crt` gem to your Gemfile. 

[Sigv4a](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html)
is an extension to Sigv4 that allows signatures that are valid in more than one region.
Sigv4a is required to use some services/operations such as
[S3 Multi-Region Access Points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/MultiRegionAccessPoints.html)
and Amazon EventBridge Global Endpoints.
Currently sigv4a requires the [aws-crt](https://rubygems.org/gems/aws-crt/) gem.  The `aws-sigv4` signers 
will automatically use the CRT provided signers with support for `sigv4a` when the `aws-crt` gem is available.

```ruby
gem 'aws-sdk-s3', '~> 1'
gem 'aws-sigv4', '1.4.1.crt'
```
