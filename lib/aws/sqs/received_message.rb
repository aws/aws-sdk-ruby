      # Deletes the message from the queue.  Even if the message is
      # locked by another reader due to the visibility timeout
      # setting, it is still deleted from the queue.  If you leave a
      # message in the queue for more than 4 days, SQS automatically
      # deletes it.
      #
      # If you use {Queue#poll} or {Queue#receive_message} in block
      # form, the messages you receive will be deleted automatically
      # unless an exception occurs while you are processing them.
      # You can still use this method if you want to delete a
      # message early and then continue processing it.
      #
      # @note It is possible you will receive a message even after
      #   you have deleted it. This might happen on rare occasions
      #   if one of the servers storing a copy of the message is
      #   unavailable when you request to delete the message. The
      #   copy remains on the server and might be returned to you
      #   again on a subsequent receive request. You should create
      #   your system to be idempotent so that receiving a
      #   particular message more than once is not a problem.

      # Changes the visibility timeout of a specified message in a
      # queue to a new value. The maximum allowed timeout value you
      # can set the value to is 12 hours. This means you can't
      # extend the timeout of a message in an existing queue to more
      # than a total visibility timeout of 12 hours. (For more
      # information visibility timeout, see
      # [Visibility Timeout](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/IntroductionArticle.html#AboutVT)
      # in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.)
      #
      # For example, let's say the timeout for the queue is 30
      # seconds, and you receive a message. Once you're 20 seconds
      # into the timeout for that message (i.e., you have 10 seconds
      # left), you extend it by 60 seconds by calling this method
      # with `timeout` set to 60 seconds. You have then changed the
      # remaining visibility timeout from 10 seconds to 60 seconds.
      #
      # @note If you attempt to set the timeout to an amount more
      #   than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an
      #   error. It will not automatically recalculate and increase
      #   the timeout to the maximum time remaining.
      #
      # @note Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility
      #   timeout for a specific message, that timeout value is
      #   applied immediately but is not saved in memory for that
      #   message. If you don't delete a message after it is
      #   received, the visibility timeout for the message the next
      #   time it is received reverts to the original timeout value,
      #   not the value you set with this method.
