      # AWS::Core::Collection::Simple is used by collections that always
      # recieve every matching items in a single response.
      #
      # This means:
      #
      # * Paging methods are simulated
      #
      # * Next tokens are artificial (guessable numeric offsets)
      #
      # AWS services generally return all items only for requests with a
      # small maximum number of results.
      #
      # See {AWS::Core::Collection} for documentation on the available
      # collection methods.
