      # == Variable Batch Sizes
      #
      # Each AWS service has its own rules on how it returns results.
      # Because of this batch size may very based on:
      #
      # * Service limits (e.g. S3 limits keys to 1000 per response)
      #
      # * The size of response objects (SimpleDB limits responses to 1MB)
      #
      # * Time to process the request
      #
      # Because of these variables, batch sizes may not be consistent for
      # a single collection.  Each batch represents all of the items returned
      # in a single resopnse.
      #
      # @note If you require fixed batch sizes, see {#in_groups_of}.
