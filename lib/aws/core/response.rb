    # # Response
    #
    # Each Service has a Client class.  There is one method per service
    # operation defined on the client.  These methods all return a {Response}
    # object.
    #
    # In addition to the response data, these responses provide metadata
    # about the HTTP request made and the HTTP response received.
    #
    # ## Response Data
    #
    # You can access the response data for a client request using the {#data}
    # method or the {#[]} method.  Response data is a hash and {#[]} is
    # a shortcut for accessing this hash.
    #
    #     # make a request to describe one instance
    #     ec2 = AWS::EC2.new
    #     response = ec2.client.describe_instances(:instance_ids => ['i-12345678'])
    #
    #     # find the instance in the response data (2 ways to get the data)
    #     instance = response[:reservation_set].first[:instance_set].first
    #     instance = response.data[:reservation_set].first[:instance_set].first
    #
    #     instance[:status] #=> 'running'
    #
    # ## Response Metadata
    #
    # In addition to the response data, there is additional information
    # available with the response, including:
    #
    # * {#request_type} - the name of the client request method
    # * {#request_options} - the hash of options passed to the client method
    # * {#http_request} - The HTTP request made
    # * {#http_response} - the HTTP response received
    #
    # Given the example and response object from above:
    #
    #     response.request_type #=> :describe_instances
    #     response.request_options #=> { :instance_ids => ['i-12345678'] }
    #     response.http_request #=> #<AWS::Core::Http::Request>
    #     response.http_response #=> #<AWS::Core::Http::Response>
