      # @option options [required,String] :adjustment_type Specifies whether
      #   the adjustment is an absolute number or a percentage of the current
      #   capacity.  Valid values are:
      #   * 'ChangeInCapacity'
      #   * 'ExactCapacity'
      #   * 'PercentChangeInCapacity'
      #
      # @option options [required,Integer] :scaling_adjustment The number of
      #   instances by which to scale. +:adjustment_type+ determines the 
      #   interpretation of this umber (e.g., as an absolute number or as a
      #   percentage of the existing Auto Scaling group size). A positive 
      #   increment adds to the current capacity and a negative value 
      #   removes from the current capacity.
      #
      # @option options [Integer] :cooldown The amount of time, in seconds,
      #   after a scaling activity completes before any further 
      #   trigger-related scaling activities can start.
