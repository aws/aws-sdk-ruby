module AWS
  
  # This class is the starting point for working with Amazon 
  # SimpleEmailService (SES).
  #
  # To use Amazon SimpleEmailService you must first 
  # {sign up here}[http://aws.amazon.com/ses/]
  #
  # For more information about Amazon SimpleEmailService:
  #
  # * {Amazon SimpleEmailService}[http://aws.amazon.com/ses/]
  # * {Amazon SimpleEmailService Documentation}[http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ses/]
  #
  # = Credentials
  #
  # You can setup default credentials for all AWS services via 
  # AWS.config:
  #
  #   AWS.config(
  #     :access_key_id => 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
  #     :secret_access_key => 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
  # 
  # Or you can set them directly on the SimpleEmailService interface:
  #
  #   ses = AWS::SimpleEmailService.new(
  #     :access_key_id => 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
  #     :secret_access_key => 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
  #
  # = Rails
  #
  # If you want to use Amazon SimpleEmailService to send email from your
  # Rails application you just need to do 2 things:
  #
  # 1. Configure your AWS credentials with {AWS.config}
  # 2. Set SES as the delivery method:
  #
  #   config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :amazon_ses
  #
  # This has only been tested with Rails 2.3 and Rails 3.0.
  #
  # = Email Addresses
  #
  # Until you have {requested production access}[http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/InitialSetup.Customer.html]
  # you will only be able to send emails to and from verified email addresses.
  # To verify an email address:
  #
  #   ses.email_addresses.verify('youremailaddress@domain.com')
  #
  # AWS will send an email to the given email address.  Follow the link in the
  # email to verify the address.
  #
  # To explore the email addresses you have authorized:
  #
  #   ses.email_addresses.each do |address|
  #     puts address
  #   end
  #
  # See {EmailAddressCollection} for more information on working with SES email
  # addresses.
  #
  # = Sending Email
  #
  # To send a basic email you can use {#send_email}.
  #
  #   ses.send_email(
  #     :subject => 'A Sample Email',
  #     :from => 'sender@domain.com',
  #     :to => 'receipient@domain.com',
  #     :body_text => 'Sample email text.',
  #     :body_html => '<h1>Sample Email</h1>') 
  #
  # If you need to send email with attachments or have other special needs
  # that send_email does not support you can use {#send_raw_email}.
  #
  #   ses.send_raw_email(<<EMAIL)
  #   Subject: A Sample Email
  #   From: sender@domain.com
  #   To: receipient@domain.com
  #
  #   Sample email text.
  #   EMAIL
  #
  # If you prefer, you can also set the sender and recipient in ruby
  # when sending raw emails:
  #
  #   ses.send_raw_email(<<EMAIL, :to => 'to@foo.com', :from => 'from@foo.com')
  #   Subject: A Sample Email
  #
  #   Sample email text.
  #   EMAIL
  #
  # = Quotas
  #
  # Based on several factors, Amazon SES determines how much email you can
  # send and how quickly you can send it. These sending limits are defined
  # as follows:
  #
  # * +:max_send_rate+ â€” Maximum number of emails you can send per second.
  # * +:max_24_hour_send+ - Maximum number of emails you can send in a 
  #   24-hour period.
  #
  # To get your current quotas (and how many emails you have sent in the last
  # 24 hours):
  #
  #   ses.quotas
  #   # => {:max_24_hour_send=>200, :max_send_rate=>1.0, :sent_last_24_hours=>22}
  #
  # = Statistics
  #
  # You can get statistics about individual emails:
  #
  #   ses.statistics.each do |stats|
  #     puts "Sent: #{stats[:sent]}"
  #     puts "Delivery Attempts: #{stats[:delivery_attempts]}"
  #     puts "Rejects: #{stats[:rejects]}"
  #     puts "Bounces: #{stats[:bounces]}"
  #     puts "Complaints: #{stats[:complaints]}"
  #   end
  #
