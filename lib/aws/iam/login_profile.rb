    # A login profile is a user name and password that enables a user
    # to log in to the {http://aws.amazon.com/console AWS Management
    # Console}. Without a login profile, a user cannot access the
    # console. (For information about accessing and using the AWS
    # Management Console, see
    # {http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_AWSManagementConsole.html
    # Using the AWS Management Console}.)
