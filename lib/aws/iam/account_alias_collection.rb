    #
    # Currently IAM exposes the account alias in a collection, as if you
    # could create/manage multiple aliases for a single account.  However,
    # creating a 2nd alias replaces the first, it does not add an additional
    # alias.
    #
    # Because the API is modeled as a collection this class could be used
    # to work with it, but instead we consume this by the IAM class for
    # the following methods:
    #
    #   * create_account_alias
    #   * account_alias
    #   * remove_account_alias
    #
    # If IAM allows accounts to have multiple aliases, then those previous
    # 3 methods will be deprecated and this interface will be exposed.
