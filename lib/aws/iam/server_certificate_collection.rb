module AWS
  class IAM

    # A collection that provides access to IAM server certificates
    # belonging to this account.
    #
    #   iam = AWS::IAM.new
    #   certificates = iam.server_certificates
    #
    # == Uploading A Server Certificate
    #
    # You can upload any valid, signed certificate using {#upload}.
    #
    #   certificates.upload(:name => "MyCert",
    #                       :certificate_body => my_certificate_body,

    # For information about generating a server certificate for use
    # with IAM, see
    # {http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/InstallCert.html
    # Creating and Uploading Server Certificates} in <i>Using AWS
    # Identity and Access Management</i>.
    #
    # == Getting a Server Certificate by Name
    #
    # You can get a reference to a server certificate using array notation:
    #
    #   certificate = certificates['MyCert']
    #
    # == Enumerating Server Certificates
    #
    # Server certificate collections can also be used to enumerate
    # certificates:
    #
    #   certificates.each do |cert|
    #     puts cert.name
    #   end
    #
    # You can limit the certificates returned by passing a +:prefix+
    # option to any of the enumerator methods.  When you pass a
    # prefix, only the certificates whose paths start with the given
    # string will be returned.
