module AWS
  class IAM

    # Represents a group of users.  Groups don't directly interact
    # with AWS; only users do. The main reason to create groups is to
    # collectively assign permissions to the users so they can do
    # their jobs. For example, you could have a group called Admins
    # and give that group the types of permissions admins typically
    # need.
    # @attr [String] name The group's name.
    # @attr_reader [String] id The group's unique ID.
    # @attr_reader [Time] create_date When the group was created.
    # @attr_reader [String] arn The group's ARN (Amazon Resource Name).
    # @attr [String] path The group's path.  Paths are used to identify
    #   which division or part of an organization the group belongs to.
