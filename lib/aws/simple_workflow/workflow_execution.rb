    # @attr_reader [Symbol] child_policy The policy to use for the child 
    #   workflow executions if this workflow execution is terminated. 
    #   The return value will be one of the following values:
    #
    #   * +:terminate+ - the child executions will be terminated.
    #
    #   * +:request_cancel+ - a request to cancel will be attempted for each
    #     child execution by recording a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested 
    #     event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate
    #     actions when it receives an execution history with this event.
    #
    #   * +:abandon+ - no action will be taken. The child executions will 
    #     continue to run.
    #
    # @attr_reader [String] start_to_close_timeout The total allowed
    #   duration for this workflow execution.
    #
    #   The return value will be formatted as an ISO 8601 duration (e.g.
    #   'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS').
    #
    # @attr_reader [String] task_list The task list used for the decision 
    #   tasks generated for this workflow execution.
    #
    # @attr_reader [String] task_start_to_close_timeout The maximum duration
    #   allowed for decision tasks for this workflow execution.
    #
    #   The return value will be formatted as an ISO 8601 duration (e.g.
    #   'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS').
    #
    # @attr_reader [Time,nil] closed_at The time when the workflow execution
    #   was closed.  Returns nil if this execution is not closed.
    #
    # @attr_reader [Time] started_at The time when the execution was started.
    #   
    # @attr_reader [Time,nil] latest_activity_task_scheduled_at The time 
    #   when the last activity task was scheduled for this workflow execution.
    #   You can use this information to determine if the workflow has not 
    #   made progress for an unusually long period of time and might 
    #   require a corrective action.
    #
    # @attr_reader [String,nil] latest_execution_context The latest execution
    #   context provided by the decider for this workflow execution. A decider 
    #   can provide an execution context, which is a free form string, when 
    #   closing a decision task.
    #
    # @attr_reader [Hash] open_counts Returns a hash of counts, including:
    #   +:open_timers+, +:open_child_workflow_executions+, +:open_decision_tasks+,
    #   and +:open_activity_tasks+.
