    class WorkflowTypeCollection < TypeCollection

      # Registers a new workflow type and its configuration settings for
      # in the current domain.
      #
      # @param [String] name The name of the workflow type.
      #
      # @param [String] version The version of the workflow type.
      #   The workflow type consists of the name and version, the
      #   combination of which must be unique within the domain.
      #
      # @param [Hash] options
      #
      # @option options [Symbol] :default_child_policy (nil) Specifies the default
      #   policy to use for the child workflow executions when a workflow
      #   execution of this type is terminated.  This default can be
      #   overridden when starting a workflow execution. The supported child
      #   policies are:
      #
      #   * `:terminate` - the child executions will be terminated.
      #
      #   * `:request_cancel` - a request to cancel will be attempted for each
      #     child execution by recording a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested
      #     event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate
      #     actions when it receives an execution history with this event.
      #
      #   * `:abandon` - no action will be taken. The child executions will
      #     continue to run.
      #
      # @option options [Integer,:none] :default_execution_start_to_close_timeout (nil)
      #   The default maximum duration for executions of this workflow type.
      #   You can override this default when starting an execution.
      #   The value should be a number of seconds (integer) or the symbol
      #   `:none` (implying no timeout).
      #
      # @option options [String] :default_task_list (nil) Specifies
      #   the default task list to use for scheduling decision tasks for
      #   executions of this workflow type. This default is used only if
      #   a task list is not provided when starting the workflow execution.
      #
      # @option options [Integer,:none] :default_task_start_to_close_timeout (nil)
      #   The default maximum duration of decision tasks for this workflow type.
      #
      #   The value should be a number of seconds (integer) or the symbol
      #   `:none` (implying no timeout).
      #
      # @option options [String] :description (nil) Textual description of
      #   the workflow type.
