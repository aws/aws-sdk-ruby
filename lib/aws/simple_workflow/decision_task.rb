    # == Getting Decision Tasks
    #
    # You can use #poll or #poll_for_single_task on {DecisionTaskCollection}
    # to grab a decision task:
    #
    #   # get a single task
    #   if task = domain.decision_tasks.poll_for_single_task('task-list')
    #     # make decisions
    #     task.complete!
    #   end
    #
    # See {DecisionTaskCollection} for more information on getting and
    # counting decision tasks.
    #
    # == Exploring Event History
    #
    # Once you have a decision task you can examine the event history. 
    # This can give you the information you need to make decisions.
    # The {#events} and {#new_events} methods enumerate through
    # all events or events since the last decision.
    #
    #   decision_task.new_events.each do |event|
    #     # inspect the #event_type and #attributes
    #   end
    # 
    # Check out {HistoryEvent} for more information on working with
    # events.
    #
    # == Making Decisions
    #
    # Based on the history of events, you should make decisions by calling
    # methods listed below.  You can call each method as many times as
    # you wish, until you have completed the decision task.
    # 
    #  * {#schedule_activity_task}
    #  * {#request_cancel_activity_task}
    # 
    #  * {#complete_workflow_execution}
    #  * {#cancel_workflow_execution}
    #  * {#fail_workflow_execution}
    #  * {#continue_as_new_workflow_execution}
    #
    #  * {#record_marker}
    #  * {#start_timer}
    #  * {#cancel_timer}
    #
    #  * {#signal_external_workflow_execution}
    #  * {#request_cancel_external_workflow_execution}
    #  * {#start_child_workflow_execution}
    #
    # The decision methods are grouped above by concern.
    #
    # == Completing the Decision Task
    #
    # Once you have finished adding decisions to the task, you need to
    # complete it.  If you called {DecisionTaskCollection#poll} or 
    # {DecisionTaskCollection#poll_for_single_task} with a block
    # argument then the decision will be completed automatically at the
    # end of the block.
    #
    #   domain.decision_tasks.poll do |decision_task|
    #     # ...
    #   end #=> the decision task is closed here
    #
    # If you get a task from {DecisionTaskCollection#poll_for_single_task}
    # without a block, then it is your responsibility to call {#complete!}
    # on the decision task.  If you fail to do this before the
    # task start to close timeout, then a decisionTaskTimedOut event 
    # will be added to the workflow execution history.
