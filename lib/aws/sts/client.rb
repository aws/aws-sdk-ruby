      # Calls the GetFederationToken API operation.
      # @method get_federation_token(options = {})
      #
      # === Options:
      #
      # * +:name+ - *required* - (String) The name of the federated user
      #   associated with the credentials. For information about limitations on
      #   user names, go to Limitations on IAM Entities in Using AWS Identity
      #   and Access Management.
      # * +:policy+ - (String) A policy specifying the permissions to associate
      #   with the credentials. The caller can delegate their own permissions
      #   by specifying a policy, and both policies will be checked when a
      #   service call is made. For more information about how permissions work
      #   in the context of temporary credentials, see Controlling Permissions
      #   in Temporary Credentials in Using AWS Identity and Access Management.
      # * +:duration_seconds+ - (Integer) The duration, in seconds, that the
      #   session should last. Acceptable durations for federation sessions
      #   range from 3600s (one hour) to 129600s (36 hours), with 43200s (12
      #   hours) as the default.

      # === Options:
      #
      # * +:duration_seconds+ - (Integer) The duration, in seconds, that the
      #   credentials should remain valid. Acceptable durations for IAM user
      #   sessions range from 3600s (one hour) to 129600s (36 hours), with
      #   43200s (12 hours) as the default. Sessions for AWS account owners are
      #   restricted to a maximum of 3600s (one hour).
      # * +:serial_number+ - (String) The identification number of the
      #   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) device for the user. If the user
      #   has an access policy requiring MFA to access resources, provide the
      #   value here. The number is in the Security Credentials tab of the
      #   user's details pane in the IAM console. If the user has an active MFA
      #   device, the details pane displays a Multi-Factor Authentication
      #   Device value such as arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user for a virtual
      #   device or the device serial number for a hardware device.
      # * +:token_code+ - (String) The value provided by the MFA device. If the
      #   user has an access policy requiring an MFA code, provide the value
      #   here to get permission to resources as specified in the access
      #   policy. If MFA is required, and a code not provided while requesting
      #   a set of temporary security credentials, the user will receive an
      #   "access denied" response when requesting resources that require MFA.
      #   For more information, see Using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
      #   Devices with AWS in Using IAM.
