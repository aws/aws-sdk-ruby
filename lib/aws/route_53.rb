  # This class is the starting point for working with Amazon Route 53.
  #
  # To use Amazon Route 53 you must first
  # {sign up here}[http://aws.amazon.com/route53/].
  #
  # For more information about Amazon Route 53:
  #
  # * {Amazon Route 53}[http://aws.amazon.com/route53/]
  # * {Amazon Route 53 Documentation}[http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/route53/]
  #
  # = Credentials
  #
  # You can setup default credentials for all AWS services via
  # AWS.config:
  #
  #   AWS.config(
  #     :access_key_id => 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
  #     :secret_access_key => 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
  #
  # Or you can set them directly on the AWS::Route53 interface:
  #
  #   r53 = AWS::Route53.new(
  #     :access_key_id => 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
  #     :secret_access_key => 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
  #
  # = Using the Client
  #
  # AWS::Route53 does not provide higher level abstractions for Route 53 at
  # this time.  You can still access all of the API methods using
  # {AWS::Route53::Client}.  Here is how you access the client and make
  # a simple request:
  #
  #   r53 = AWS::Route53.new
  #
  #   resp = r53.client.list_hosted_zones
  #   resp[:hosted_zones].each do |zone|
  #     # ...
  #   end
  #
  # See {Client} for documentation on all of the supported operations.
  #
  # @!attribute [r] client
  #   @return [Client] the low-level Route53 client object
