module AWS

  # Provides an expressive, object-oriented interface to Amazon ElastiCache.
  #
  # ## Credentials
  #
  # You can setup default credentials for all AWS services via
  # AWS.config:
  #
  #     AWS.config(
  #       :access_key_id => 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
  #       :secret_access_key => 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
  #
  # Or you can set them directly on the ElastiCache interface:
  #
  #     ec = AWS::ElastiCache.new(
  #       :access_key_id => 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
  #       :secret_access_key => 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
  #
  # @!attribute [r] client
  #   @return [Client] the low-level ElastiCache client object
  class ElastiCache

    autoload :Client, 'aws/elasticache/client'
    autoload :Errors, 'aws/elasticache/errors'
    autoload :Request, 'aws/elasticache/request'

    include Core::ServiceInterface

    endpoint_prefix 'elasticache'

  end
