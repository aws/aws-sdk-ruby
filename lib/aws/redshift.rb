  # # Credentials
  #
  # You can setup default credentials for all AWS services via
  # AWS.config:
  #
  #     AWS.config(
  #       :access_key_id => 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
  #       :secret_access_key => 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
  #
  # Or you can set them directly on the AWS::Redshift interface:
  #
  #     redshift = AWS::Redshift.new(
  #       :access_key_id => 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
  #       :secret_access_key => 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
  #
  class Redshift

    autoload :Client, 'aws/redshift/client'
    autoload :Errors, 'aws/redshift/errors'
    autoload :Request, 'aws/redshift/request'

    include Core::ServiceInterface

    endpoint_prefix 'redshift'
