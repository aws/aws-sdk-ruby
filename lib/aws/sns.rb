  # This class is the starting point for working with Amazon Simple
  # Notification Service (SNS).
  #
  # To use Amazon SNS you must first [sign up here](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/).
  #
  # For more information about Amazon SNS:
  #
  # * [Amazon SNS](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/)
  # * [Amazon SNS Documentation](http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sns/)
  #
  # # Credentials
  #
  # You can setup default credentials for all AWS services via
  # AWS.config:
  #
  #     AWS.config(
  #       :access_key_id => 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
  #       :secret_access_key => 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
  #
  # Or you can set them directly on the SNS interface:
  #
  #     sns = AWS::SNS.new(
  #       :access_key_id => 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
  #       :secret_access_key => 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
  #
  # @!attribute [r] client
  #   @return [Client] the low-level SNS client object
