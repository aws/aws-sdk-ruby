module AWS

    class Model

      # The primary interface for finding records with {AWS::Record::Model}.
      #
      # == Getting a Scope Object
      #
      # You should normally never need to construct a Scope object directly.
      # Scope objects are returned from the AWS::Record::Model finder methods
      # (e.g. +shard+, +where+, +order+, +limit+, etc).
      #
      #   books = Book.where(:author => 'John Doe')
      #   books.class #=> AWS::Record::Scope, not Array
      #
      # Scopes are also returned from methods defined with the +scope+ method.
      #
      # == Chaining Scopes
      #
      # Scope objects represent a request, but do not actualy make a request
      # until required.  This allows you to chain requests
      #
      #   # no request made by the following 2 statements
      #   books = Book.where(:author => 'John Doe')
      #   books = books.limit(10)
      #
      #   books.each do |book|
      #     # yields up to 10 books
      #   end
      #
      # Each of the following methods returns a scope that can be chained.
      #
      # * {#shard}
      # * {#where}
      # * {#order}
      # * {#limit}
      #
      # == Terminating Scopes
      #
      # To terminate a scope you can enumerate it or call #first.
      #
      #   # terminate a scope by enumerating
      #   Book.limit(10).each {|book| ... }
      #
      #   # terminate a scope by getting the first value
      #   Book.where('author' => 'John Doe').first
