    # The primary interface for finding records with AWS::Record.
    #
    # == Getting a Scope Object
    #
    # You should normally never need to construct a Scope object directly.
    # Scope objects are returned from the AWS::Record::Base finder methods
    # (e.g. +find+ +all+, +where+, +order+, +limit+, etc).
    #
    #   books = Book.where(:author => 'John Doe')
    #   books.class #=> AWS::Record::Scope, not Array
    #
    # Scopes are also returned from methods defined with the +scope+ method.
    #
    # == Delayed Execution
    #
    # Scope objects represent a select expression, but do not actually
    # cause a request to be made until enumerated.
    #
    #   # no request made yet
    #   books = Book.where(:author => 'John Doe')
    #
    #   # a request is made now
    #   books.each {|book| ... }
    #
    # You can refine a scope object by calling other scope methods on
    # it.
    #
    #   # refine the previous books Scope, no request
    #   top_10 = books.order(:popularity, :desc).limit(10)
    #
    #   # another request is made now
    #   top_10.first
