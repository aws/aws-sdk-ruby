    # Represents a collection of VPC subnets.  You can get a subnet collection
    # two ways.  You can get a collection that represents ALL subnets (across
    # all your VPCs).  You can also get a subnet collection that represents
    # subnets within a single vpc.
    #
    #   # represents all subnets
    #   subnets = ec2.subnets
    #
    #   # represents subnets within the named vpc
    #   subnets = ec2.vpcs['vpc-12345'].subnets
    #
    # == Creating a Subnet
    #
    # To create a subnet, call {#create} on a subnet collection, passing in
    # a suitable CIDR block.
    #
    #   subnet = subnets.create('10.0.0.0/20')
    #
    # You can optionally pass the availability zone you want the subnet
    # created in.
    #
    # == Getting a Subnet
    #
    # If you know the subnet id, you can get a subnet using {#[]}.
    #
    #   subnet = subnets['subnet-id-here']
    #
    # You can filter subnets as well.  See the EC2 API documentation 
    # (http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-DescribeSubnets.html) for a complete list of accepted filters.
