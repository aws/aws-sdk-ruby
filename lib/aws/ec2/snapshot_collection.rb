module AWS
  class EC2

    # Represents a collection of Amazon EBS snapshots.  Typically
    # you should get an instance of this class by calling
    # {EC2#snapshots}.
    #
    # @example Create a snapshot from a volume
    #  ec2.snapshots.create(:volume => ec2.volumes["vol-123"],
    #                       :description => "my snapshot")
    #  # or:
    #  ec2.volumes["vol-123"].create_snapshot("my snapshot")
    #
    # @example Get a snapshot by ID
    #  snapshot = ec2.snapshots["vol-123"]
    #  snapshot.exists?
    #
    # @example Get a map of snapshot IDs to snapshot status
    #   ec2.snapshots.inject({}) { |m, s| m[i.id] = s.status; m }
    #   # => { "snap-12345678" => :pending, "snap-87654321" => :completed }
