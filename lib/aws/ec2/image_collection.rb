module AWS
  class EC2

    # Represents a collection of EC2 images.  You can use this to
    # find out which images exist with the characteristics you are
    # interested in:
    #
    #  ec2 = EC2.new
    #  all_images = ec2.images
    #  amazon_owned_images = all_images.with_owner('amazon')
    #  my_images = all_images.with_owner('self')
    #  tagged_amis = all_images.tagged('mytag')
    #  tagged_amis.map(&:id)   # => ["ami-123", ...]
    #
    # You can also use it to create new images.  For example:
    #
    #  ec2.images.create(:instance_id => "i-123",
    #                    :name => "my-image")

      #
      # @param [Hash] options Options for creating the image.
      #   +:name+ is required, and you must also specify one of the
      #   following options:
      #
      #   * +:instance_id+
      #   * +:image_location+
      #   * +:root_device_name+
      #
      # @option options [String] :instance_id The ID of a running
      #   instance.  This instance will be rebooted unless
      #   +:no_reboot+ is set to +true+.
      #
      # @option options [String] :description A description of the
      #   new image.
      #
      # @option options [Boolean] :no_reboot By default this
      #   option is set to +false+, which means Amazon EC2
      #   attempts to cleanly shut down the instance before image
      #   creation and reboots the instance afterwards. When the
      #   option is set to +true+, Amazon EC2 does not shut down
      #   the instance before creating the image. When this option
      #   is used, file system integrity on the created image cannot
      #   be guaranteed.
      #
      #   *Note*: This option is only valid when used with
      #   +:instance_id+.
      #
      # @option options [String] :image_location Full path to your
      #   AMI manifest in Amazon S3 storage.  This must be of the
      #   form "bucket_name/key".
      #
      # @option options [String] :architecture The architecture of
      #   the image.  Valid values:
      #
      #   * +:i386+
      #   * +:x86_64+
      #
      #   *Note*: This option is only valid with +:image_location+
      #   or +:root_device_name+
      #
      # @option options [String] :kernel_id The ID of the kernel to
      #   select.
      #
      #   *Note*: This option is only valid with +:image_location+
      #   or +:root_device_name+
      #
      # @option options [Image] :kernel The kernel image to use.
      #   Equivalent to passing +:kernel_id+ with the ID of the
      #   image.
      #
      #   *Note*: This option is only valid with +:image_location+
      #   or +:root_device_name+
      #
      # @option options [String] :ramdisk_id The ID of the RAM disk
      #   to select. Some kernels require additional drivers at
      #   launch. Check the kernel requirements for information on
      #   whether you need to specify a RAM disk. To find kernel
      #   requirements, refer to the Resource Center and search for
      #   the kernel ID.
      #
      #   *Note*: This option is only valid with +:image_location+
      #   or +:root_device_name+
      #
      # @option options [Image] :ramdisk The ramdisk image to use.
      #   Equivalent to passing +:ramdisk_id+ with the ID of the
      #   image.
      #
      #   *Note*: This option is only valid with +:image_location+
      #   or +:root_device_name+
      #
      # @option options [String] :root_device_name The root device
      #   name (e.g., /dev/sda1, or xvda).
      #
      # @option options [Hash] :block_device_mappings This must be a
      #   hash; the keys are device names to map, and the value for
      #   each entry determines how that device is mapped.  Valid
      #   values include:
      #
      #   * A string, which is interpreted as a virtual device name.
      #
      #   * A hash with any of the following options.  One of
      #     +:snapshot+, +:snapshot_id+ or +:volume_size+ is
      #     required.
      #
      #     [:snapshot] A snapshot to use when creating the block
      #                 device.
      #
      #     [:snapshot_id] The ID of a snapshot to use when creating
      #                    the block device.
      #
      #     [:volume_size] The size of volume to create, in gigabytes.
      #
      #     [:delete_on_termination] Setting this to true causes EC2
      #                              to delete the volume when the
      #                              instance is terminated.
