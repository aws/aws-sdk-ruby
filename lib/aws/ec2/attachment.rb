    #  volume = ec2.volumes.create(:size => 15,
    #                              :availability_zone => "us-east-1a")
    #  attachment = volume.attach_to(ec2.instances["i-123"], "/dev/sdf")
    #  sleep 1 until attachment.status != :attaching
    #
    # @example Remove all attachments from a volume and then delete it
    #  volume.attachments.each do |attachment|
    #    attachment.delete(:force => true)
    #  end
    #  sleep 1 until volume.status == :available
