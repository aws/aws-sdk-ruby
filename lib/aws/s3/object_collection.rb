  class S3

    # Represents a collection of S3 objects.
    #
    # == Getting an S3Object by Key
    #
    # If you know the key of the object you want, you can reference it this way:
    #
    #   # this will not make any requests against S3
    #   object = bucket.objects['foo.jpg']
    #   object.key #=> 'foo.jpg'
    #
    # == Finding objects with a Prefix
    #
    # Given a bucket with the following keys:
    #
    #   photos/sunset.jpg
    #   photos/sunrise.jpg
    #   photos/winter.jpg
    #   videos/comedy.mpg
    #   videos/dancing.mpg
    #
    # You can list objects that share a prefix:
    #
    #   bucket.objects.with_prefix('videos').collect(&:key)
    #   #=> ['videos/comedy.mpg', 'videos/dancing.mpg']
    #
    # == Exploring Objects with a Tree Interface
    #
    # Given a bucket with the following keys:
    #
    #   README.txt
    #   videos/wedding.mpg
    #   videos/family_reunion.mpg
    #   photos/2010/house.jpg
    #   photos/2011/fall/leaves.jpg
    #   photos/2011/summer/vacation.jpg
    #   photos/2011/summer/family.jpg
    #
    #   tree = bucket.objects.with_prefix('photos').as_tree
    #
    #   directories = tree.children.select(&:branch?).collect(&:prefix)
    #   #=> ['photos/2010', 'photos/2011']
    #
