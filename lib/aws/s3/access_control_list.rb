module AWS
  class S3

    # Represents an access control list for S3 objects and buckets.  For example:
    #
    #   acl = AccessControlList.new
    #   acl.grant(:full_control).
    #     to(:canonical_user_id => "8a6925ce4adf588a4f21c32aa379004fef")
    #   acl.to_xml                   # => '<AccessControlPolicy>...'
    #
    # You can also construct an AccessControlList from a hash:
    #
    #   AccessControlList.new(

    #
    # @see ACLObject
    #
    # @attr [AccessControlList::Owner] owner The owner of the access
    #   control list.  You can set this as a hash, for example:
    #    acl.owner = { :id => '8a6925ce4adf588a4f21c32aa379004fef' }
    #   This attribute is required when setting an ACL.
    #
    # @attr [list of AccessControlList::Grant] grants The list of
    #   grants.  You can set this as a list of hashes, for example:
    #    acl.grants = [{ :grantee => { :canonical_user_id =>
    #                                  "8a6925ce4adf588a4f21c32aa379004fef" },

      #
      # * You can specify the canonical user ID, for example.  When
      #   you read an ACL from S3, all grantees will be identified
      #   this way, and the display_name attribute will also be provided.

      #
      # * You can specify the e-mail address of an AWS customer, for example:
      #    Grantee.new(:amazon_customer_email => 'foo@example.com')
      #
      # * You can specify a group URI, for example:
      #    Grantee.new(:group_uri => 'http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers')
      #   For more details about group URIs, see:
      #   http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ACLOverview.html
      #
      # When constructing a grantee, you must provide a value for
      # exactly one of the following attributes:
      #
      # * +amazon_customer_email+
      # * +canonical_user_id+
      # * +group_uri+
      #
      # @attr [String] amazon_customer_email The e-mail address of
      #   an AWS customer.
      #
      # @attr [String] canonical_user_id The canonical user ID of an
      #   AWS customer.
      #
      # @attr [String] group_uri A URI that identifies a particular
      #   group of users.
      #
      # @attr [String] display_name The display name associated with
      #   the grantee.  This is provided by S3 when reading an ACL.
