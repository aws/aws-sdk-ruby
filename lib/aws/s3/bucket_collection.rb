module AWS
  class S3

    # Represents a collection of buckets.
    #
    # You can use this to create a bucket:
    #
    #     s3.buckets.create("mybucket")
    #
    # You can get a handle for a specific bucket with indifferent
    # access:
    #
    #     bucket = s3.buckets[:mybucket]
    #     bucket = s3.buckets['mybucket']
    #
    # You can also use it to find out which buckets are in your account:
    #
    #     s3.buckets.collect(&:name)
    #     #=> ['bucket1', 'bucket2', ...]
    #
    class BucketCollection

      include Core::Model
      include Enumerable

      # Creates and returns a new Bucket.  For example:
      #
      # @note If your bucket name contains one or more periods and it
      #   is hosted in a non-US region, you should make requests
      #   against the bucket using the S3 endpoint specific to the
      #   region in which your bucket resides. For example:
      #
      #       s3 = AWS::S3.new(:region => "eu-west-1")
      #       bucket = s3.buckets.create("my.eu.bucket")
      #
      #   For a full list of endpoints and regions, see
      #   {http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html
      #   Regions and Endpoints} in the Amazon Web Services General
      #   Reference.
      #
      # @example

      # @option options [String] :location_constraint (nil) The
      #   location where the bucket should be created.  Defaults to
      #   the classic US region; however, if you configure a regional
      #   endpoint for Amazon S3 this option will default to the
      #   appropriate location constraint for the endpoint.  For
      #   example:
      #
      #       s3 = AWS::S3.new(:region => "us-west-1")
      #       bucket = s3.buckets.create("my-us-west-bucket")
