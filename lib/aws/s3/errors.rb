    # This module contains exception classes for each of the error
    # types that S3 can return.  You can use these classes to rescue
    # specific errors, for example:
    #
    #  begin
    #    S3.new.buckets.mybucket.
    #      objects.myobj.write("HELLO")
    #  rescue S3::Errors::NoSuchBucket => e
    #    S3.new.buckets.create("mybucket")
    #    retry
    #  end
    #
    # All errors raised as a result of error responses from the
    # service are instances of either {ClientError} or {ServerError}.
