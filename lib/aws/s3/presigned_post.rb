  class S3

    # Helper to generate form fields for presigned POST requests to
    # a bucket.  You can use this to create a form that can be used
    # from a web browser to upload objects to S3 while specifying
    # conditions on what can be uploaded and how it is processed and
    # stored.
    #
    # @example Form fields for uploading by file name
    #
    #   form = bucket.presigned_post(:key => "photos/${filename}")
    #   form.url.to_s        # => "https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/"
    #   form.fields          # => { "AWSAccessKeyId" => "...", ... }
    #
    # @example Generating a minimal HTML form
    #
    #   form = bucket.objects.myobj.presigned_post
    #   hidden_inputs = form.fields.map do |(name, value)|
    #     %(<input type="hidden" name="#{name}" value="#{value}" />)
    #   end
    #   <<-END
    #   <form action="#{form.url}" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    #     #{hidden_inputs}
    #     <input type="file" name="file" />
    #   </form>
    #   END
    #
    # @example Restricting the size of the uploaded object
    #
    #   bucket.presigned_post(:content_length => 1..(10*1024))
    #
    # @example Restricting the key prefix

      #   form fields for those values -- you should use the {#where}
      #   method on the returned object instead of providing the
      #   values here.
      #
      # @option opts [String] :key The key of the object that will

      #   uploaded with any key that satisfies the conditions
      #   specified for the upload (see {#where}).
      #
      # @option opts [Boolean] :secure By setting this to false, you
      #   can cause {#url} to return an HTTP URL.  By default it
      #   returns an HTTPS URL.
      #
      # @option opts [Time, DateTime, Integer, String] :expires The
      #   time at which the signature will expire.  By default the
      #   signature will expire one hour after it is generated
      #   (e.g. when {#fields} is called).
      #
      #   When the value is a Time or DateTime, the signature
      #   expires at the specified time.  When it is an integer, the
      #   signature expires the specified number of seconds after it
      #   is generated.  When it is a string, the string is parsed
      #   as a time (using Time.parse) and the signature expires at
      #   that time.
      #
      # @option opts [String] :cache_control Sets the Cache-Control
      #   header stored with the object.
      #
      # @option opts [String] :content_type Sets the Content-Type
      #   header stored with the object.
      #
      # @option opts [String] :content_disposition Sets the
      #   Content-Disposition header stored with the object.
      #
      # @option opts [String] :expires_header Sets the Expires
      #   header stored with the object.
      #
      # @option options [Symbol] :acl A canned access control
      #   policy.  Valid values are:
      #   * `:private`
      #   * `:public_read`
      #   * `:public_read_write`
      #   * `:authenticated_read`

      #   * `:bucket_owner_full_control`
      #
      # @option options [Symbol] :server_side_encryption (nil) If this
      #   option is set, the object will be stored using server side
      #   encryption.  The only valid value is `:aes256`, which
      #   specifies that the object should be stored using the AES
      #   encryption algorithm with 256 bit keys.  By default, this
      #   option uses the value of the `:s3_server_side_encryption`
      #   option in the current configuration; for more information,
      #   see {AWS.config}.
      #
      # @option opts [String] :success_action_redirect The URL to
      #   which the client is redirected upon successful upload.
      #
      # @option opts [Integer] :success_action_status The status
      #   code returned to the client upon successful upload if
      #   `:success_action_redirect` is not specified.  Accepts the
      #   values 200, 201, or 204 (default).
      #
      #   If the value is set to 200 or 204, Amazon S3 returns an
      #   empty document with a 200 or 204 status code.
      #
      #   If the value is set to 201, Amazon S3 returns an XML
      #   document with a 201 status code.  For information on the
      #   content of the XML document, see
      #   [POST Object](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/2006-03-01/API/index.html?RESTObjectPOST.html).

      #   included in the signed fields.  Additional metadata fields
      #   may be provided with the upload as long as they satisfy
      #   the conditions specified for the upload (see {#where}).
      #
      # @option opts [Integer, Range] :content_length The range of
      #   acceptable object sizes for the upload.  By default any
      #   size object may be uploaded.

      # @option opts [Array<String>] :ignore Additional fields which
