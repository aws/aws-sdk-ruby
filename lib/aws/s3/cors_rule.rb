    # Represents a single CORS rule for an S3 {Bucket}.

    class CORSRule

      # @param [Hash] options A hash of the rule details.
      #
      # @option options [String] :id A unique identifier for the rule. The ID
      #   value can be up to 255 characters long. The IDs help you find
      #   a rule in the configuration.
      #
      # @option options [required,Array<String>] :allowed_methods A list of HTTP
      #   methods that you want to allow the origin to execute.
      #   Each rule must identify at least one method.
      #
      # @option options [required,Array<String>] :allowed_origins A list of
      #   origins you want to allow cross-domain requests from. This can
      #   contain at most one * wild character.
      #
      # @option options [Array<String>] :allowed_headers A list of headers
      #   allowed in a pre-flight OPTIONS request via the
      #   Access-Control-Request-Headers header. Each header name
      #   specified in the Access-Control-Request-Headers header must
      #   have a corresponding entry in the rule.
      #
      #   Amazon S3 will send only the allowed headers in a response
      #   that were requested. This can contain at most one '*' wild
      #   character.
      #
      # @option options [Array<String>] :max_age_seconds The time in
      #   seconds that your browser is to cache the pre-flight response for
      #   the specified resource.
      #
      # @option options [Array<String>] :expose_headers One or more headers in
      #    the response that you want customers to be able to access
      #    from their applications (for example, from a JavaScript
      #    XMLHttpRequest object).
