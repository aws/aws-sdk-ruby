      # can descend deeper into the tree using {Parent#children} or go
      # back to the parent node using {#parent}.

      # When enumerating nodes in an S3 tree keys grouped by a common
      # prefix are represented as a branch node.

      # Branch nodes are often treated like directories.

      # @note Generally you do not need to create branch nodes.
