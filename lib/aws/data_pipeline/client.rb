      #   * `:name` - *required* - (String) The name of the new pipeline. You
      #     can use the same name for multiple pipelines associated with your
      #     AWS account, because AWS Data Pipeline assigns each new pipeline a
      #     unique pipeline identifier.
      #   * `:unique_id` - *required* - (String) A unique identifier that you
      #     specify. This identifier is not the same as the pipeline identifier
      #     assigned by AWS Data Pipeline. You are responsible for defining the
      #     format and ensuring the uniqueness of this identifier. You use this
      #     parameter to ensure idempotency during repeated calls to
      #     CreatePipeline. For example, if the first call to CreatePipeline
      #     does not return a clear success, you can pass in the same unique
      #     identifier and pipeline name combination on a subsequent call to
      #     CreatePipeline. CreatePipeline ensures that if a pipeline already
      #     exists with the same name and unique identifier, a new pipeline
      #     will not be created. Instead, you'll receive the pipeline
      #     identifier from the previous attempt. The uniqueness of the name
      #     and unique identifier combination is scoped to the AWS account or
      #     IAM user credentials.

      #           fields beginning with the at sign (@) are read-only and set

      #           names containing only alpha-numeric values, as symbols may be
      #           reserved by AWS Data Pipeline. A best practice for
      #           user-defined fields that you add to a pipeline is to prefix
      #           their name with the string "my". Valid values include:
