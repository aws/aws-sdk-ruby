    # = StackResourceCollection 
    #
    # This collection represents the resources for a single {Stack}.
    # You can enumerate resources, or request a specific resource
    # by its logical resource id.
    #
    # = Other Ways to Get Resource Details
    #
    # If you want to get a {StackResource} by its physical resource
    # id, then you should use {CloudFormation#stack_resource}.
    #
    # You can also take a look at {Stack#resource_summaries} for
    # light-weight hashes of stack resource details.
    #
    # @example Enumerating stack resources
    #
    #   # enumerating all resources for a stack
    #   stack.resources.each do |resource|
    #     puts resource.resource_type + " " + resource.physical_resource_id
    #   end
    # 
    # @example Getting a stack resource by its logical resource id
    #
    #   resource = stack.resources['web']
