    # = Stack Summaries
    #
    # Stack summaries contain information about CloudFormation
    # stacks.  You can filter the stacks you want summary information
    # for by one or more statuses.  You can even get information
    # about deleted stacks for up to 90 days.
    #
    # == Enumerating Stack Summaries
    #
    # You can enumerate all available summaries using enumerable
    # methods.  Yielded summaries are simple hashes.
    #
    #   cfm = AWS::CloudFormation.new
    #   cfm.stack_summaries.each do |summary|
    #     puts summary.to_yaml
    #   end
    #
    # == Filtering Stack Summaries
    #
    # You can optionally provide one or more stack stasus values
    # to filter the results by.  Only stacks with the given status(es)
    # will be enumerated.
    #
    #   cfm.stack_summaries.with_status(:create_failed).each do |summary|
    #     # ...
    #   end
    #
    #   # enumerate stacks with various delete statuses
    #   statuses = %w(delete_in_progress delete_failed delete_complete)
    #   cf.stack_summaries.with_status(statuses).each do |summary|
    #     # ...
    #   end

      #     puts summary[:stack_name]

      # Status names may be symbolized (snake-cased) or upper-cased strings
      # (e.g. :create_in_progress, 'CREATE_IN_PROGRESS').
      #
