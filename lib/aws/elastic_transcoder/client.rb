      #   * `:pipeline_id` - (String) The Id of the pipeline that you want
      #     Elastic Transcoder to use for transcoding. The pipeline determines
      #     several settings, including the Amazon S3 bucket from which Elastic
      #     Transcoder gets the files to transcode and the bucket into which
      #     Elastic Transcoder puts the transcoded files.
      #   * `:input` - (Hash) A section of the request body that provides
      #     information about the file that is being transcoded.
      #     * `:key` - (String) The name of the file to transcode. Elsewhere in
      #       the body of the JSON block is the the ID of the pipeline to use
      #       for processing the job. The InputBucket object in that pipeline
      #       tells Elastic Transcoder which Amazon S3 bucket to get the file
      #       from. If the file name includes a prefix, such as
      #       cooking/lasagna.mpg, include the prefix in the key. If the file
      #       isn't in the specified bucket, Elastic Transcoder returns an
      #       error.
      #     * `:frame_rate` - (String) The frame rate of the input file. If you
      #       want Elastic Transcoder to automatically detect the frame rate of
      #       the input file, specify auto. If you want to specify the frame
      #       rate for the input file, enter one of the following values: 10,
      #       15, 23.97, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 60 If you specify a value other
      #       than auto, Elastic Transcoder disables automatic detection of the
      #       frame rate.
      #     * `:resolution` - (String) This value must be auto, which causes
      #       Elastic Transcoder to automatically detect the resolution of the
      #       input file.
      #     * `:aspect_ratio` - (String) The aspect ratio of the input file. If
      #       you want Elastic Transcoder to automatically detect the aspect
      #       ratio of the input file, specify auto. If you want to specify the
      #       aspect ratio for the output file, enter one of the following
      #       values: 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 If you specify a value other than
      #       auto, Elastic Transcoder disables automatic detection of the
      #       aspect ratio.
      #     * `:interlaced` - (String) Whether the input file is interlaced. If
      #       you want Elastic Transcoder to automatically detect whether the
      #       input file is interlaced, specify auto. If you want to specify
      #       whether the input file is interlaced, enter one of the following
      #       values: `true` , `false` If you specify a value other than auto,
      #       Elastic Transcoder disables automatic detection of interlacing.
      #     * `:container` - (String) The container type for the input file. If
      #       you want Elastic Transcoder to automatically detect the container
      #       type of the input file, specify auto. If you want to specify the
      #       container type for the input file, enter one of the following
      #       values: 3gp, asf, avi, divx, flv, mkv, mov, mp4, mpeg, mpeg-ps,
      #       mpeg-ts, mxf, ogg, vob, wav, webm
      #   * `:output` - (Hash)
      #     * `:key` - (String) The name to assign to the transcoded file.
      #       Elastic Transcoder saves the file in the Amazon S3 bucket
      #       specified by the OutputBucket object in the pipeline that is
      #       specified by the pipeline ID. If a file with the specified name
      #       already exists in the output bucket, the job fails.
      #     * `:thumbnail_pattern` - (String) Whether you want Elastic
      #       Transcoder to create thumbnails for your videos and, if so, how
      #       you want Elastic Transcoder to name the files. If you don't want
      #       Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails, specify "". If you do
      #       want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails, specify the
      #       information that you want to include in the file name for each
      #       thumbnail. You can specify the following values in any sequence:
      #       {count} (Required): If you want to create thumbnails, you must
      #       include {count} in the ThumbnailPattern object. Wherever you
      #       specify {count}, Elastic Transcoder adds a five-digit sequence
      #       number (beginning with 00001) to thumbnail file names. The number
      #       indicates where a given thumbnail appears in the sequence of
      #       thumbnails for a transcoded file. If you specify a literal value
      #       and/or {resolution} but you omit {count}, Elastic Transcoder
      #       returns a validation error and does not create the job. Literal
      #       values (Optional): You can specify literal values anywhere in the
      #       ThumbnailPattern object. For example, you can include them as a
      #       file name prefix or as a delimiter between {resolution} and
      #       {count}. {resolution} (Optional): If you want Elastic Transcoder
      #       to include the resolution in the file name, include {resolution}
      #       in the ThumbnailPattern object. When creating thumbnails, Elastic
      #       Transcoder automatically saves the files in the format (.jpg or
      #       .png) that appears in the preset that you specified in the
      #       PresetID value of CreateJobOutput. Elastic Transcoder also
      #       appends the applicable file name extension.
      #     * `:rotate` - (String) The number of degrees clockwise by which you
      #       want Elastic Transcoder to rotate the output relative to the
      #       input. Enter one of the following values: auto, 0, 90, 180, 270.
      #       The value auto generally works only if the file that you're
      #       transcoding contains rotation metadata.
      #     * `:preset_id` - (String) The Id of the preset to use for this job.
      #       The preset determines the audio, video, and thumbnail settings
      #       that Elastic Transcoder uses for transcoding.
      #     * `:segment_duration` - (String) If you specify a preset in
      #       PresetId for which the value of Container is ts (MPEG-TS),
      #       SegmentDuration is the duration of each .ts file in seconds. The
      #       range of valid values is 1 to 60 seconds.
      #     * `:watermarks` - (Array<Hash>) Information about the watermarks
      #       that you want Elastic Transcoder to add to the video during
      #       transcoding. You can specify up to four watermarks for each
      #       output. Settings for each watermark must be defined in the preset
      #       for the current output.
      #       * `:preset_watermark_id` - (String) The ID of the watermark
      #         settings that Elastic Transcoder uses to add watermarks to the
      #         video during transcoding. The settings are in the preset
      #         specified by Preset for the current output. In that preset, the
      #         value of Watermarks Id tells Elastic Transcoder which settings
      #         to use.
      #       * `:input_key` - (String) The name of the .png or .jpg file that
      #         you want to use for the watermark. To determine which Amazon S3
      #         bucket contains the specified file, Elastic Transcoder checks
      #         the pipeline specified by Pipeline; the Input Bucket object in
      #         that pipeline identifies the bucket. If the file name includes
      #         a prefix, for example, logos/128x64.png, include the prefix in
      #         the key. If the file isn't in the specified bucket, Elastic
      #         Transcoder returns an error.
      #   * `:outputs` - (Array<Hash>) A section of the request body that
      #     provides information about the transcoded (target) files. We
      #     recommend that you use the Outputs syntax instead of the Output
      #     syntax.
      #     * `:key` - (String) The name to assign to the transcoded file.
      #       Elastic Transcoder saves the file in the Amazon S3 bucket
      #       specified by the OutputBucket object in the pipeline that is
      #       specified by the pipeline ID. If a file with the specified name
      #       already exists in the output bucket, the job fails.
      #     * `:thumbnail_pattern` - (String) Whether you want Elastic
      #       Transcoder to create thumbnails for your videos and, if so, how
      #       you want Elastic Transcoder to name the files. If you don't want
      #       Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails, specify "". If you do

      #     Elastic Transcoder to prepend to the names of all files that this
      #     job creates, including output files, thumbnails, and playlists.
      #   * `:playlists` - (Array<Hash>) If you specify a preset in PresetId
      #     for which the value of Container is ts (MPEG-TS), Playlists
      #     contains information about the master playlists that you want
      #     Elastic Transcoder to create. We recommend that you create only one
      #     master playlist. The maximum number of master playlists in a job is
      #     30.
      #     * `:name` - (String) The name that you want Elastic Transcoder to
      #       assign to the master playlist, for example, nyc-vacation.m3u8.

      #       one master playlist (not recommended), the values of all Name
      #       objects must be unique. Elastic Transcoder automatically appends
      #       .m3u8 to the file name. If you include .m3u8 in Name, it will

      #       used for standard-definition digital TV broadcasts. high: The
      #       profile used for high-definition digital TV broadcasts and for
      #       Blu-ray discs. Level (H.264 Only) The H.264 level that you want

      #       decoded picture buffer in macroblocks * 256 / (Width in pixels *
      #       Height in pixels)), 16) where Width in pixels and Height in
      #       pixels represent either MaxWidth and MaxHeight, or Resolution.
      #       Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks depends on the
      #       value of the Level object. See the list below. (A macroblock is a
      #       block of pixels measuring 16x16.) 1 - 396 1b - 396 1.1 - 900 1.2

      #       number of bits per second in a video buffer; the size of the
      #       buffer is specified by BufferSize. Specify a value between 16 and
      #       62,500. You can reduce the bandwidth required to stream a video
      #       by reducing the maximum bit rate, but this also reduces the
      #       quality of the video. BufferSize The maximum number of bits in
      #       any x seconds of the output video. This window is commonly 10
      #       seconds, the standard segment duration when you’re using MPEG-TS
      #       for the container type of the output video. Specify an integer
      #       greater than 0. If you specify MaxBitRate and omit BufferSize,
      #       Elastic Transcoder sets BufferSize to 10 times the value of
      #       MaxBitRate.
      #     * `:keyframes_max_dist` - (String) The maximum number of frames
      #       between key frames. Key frames are fully encoded frames; the
      #       frames between key frames are encoded based, in part, on the
      #       content of the key frames. The value is an integer formatted as a
      #       string; valid values are between 1 (every frame is a key frame)
      #       and 100000, inclusive. A higher value results in higher
      #       compression but may also discernibly decrease video quality.
      #     * `:fixed_gop` - (String) Whether to use a fixed value for
      #       FixedGOP. Valid values are `true` and `false` : `true` : Elastic
      #       Transcoder uses the value of KeyframesMaxDist for the distance
      #       between key frames (the number of frames in a group of pictures,

      #       file. Valid values include: auto, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 If you
      #       specify auto, Elastic Transcoder tries to preserve the aspect
      #       ratio of the input file. If you specify an aspect ratio for the
      #       output file that differs from aspect ratio of the input file,
      #       Elastic Transcoder adds pillarboxing (black bars on the sides) or
      #       letterboxing (black bars on the top and bottom) to maintain the

      #       scales the output video so it matches the value that you
      #       specified in either MaxWidth or MaxHeight without exceeding the
      #       other value. Fill: Elastic Transcoder scales the output video so
      #       it matches the value that you specified in either MaxWidth or
      #       MaxHeight and matches or exceeds the other value. Elastic

      #       and opacity of graphics that you want Elastic Transcoder to
      #       overlay over videos that are transcoded using this preset. You
      #       can specify settings for up to four watermarks. Watermarks appear
      #       in the specified size and location, and with the specified
      #       opacity for the duration of the transcoded video. Watermarks can
      #       be in .png or .jpg format. If you want to display a watermark
      #       that is not rectangular, use the .png format, which supports
      #       transparency. When you create a job that uses this preset, you
      #       specify the .png or .jpg graphics that you want Elastic
      #       Transcoder to include in the transcoded videos. You can specify
      #       fewer graphics in the job than you specify watermark settings in
      #       the preset, which allows you to use the same preset for up to
      #       four watermarks that have different dimensions.
      #       * `:id` - (String) A unique identifier for the settings for one
      #         watermark. The value of Id can be up to 40 characters long.

      #       * `:max_height` - (String) The maximum height of the watermark in
      #         one of the following formats: number of pixels (px): The
      #         minimum value is 16 pixels, and the maximum value is the value
      #         of MaxHeight. integer percentage (%): The range of valid values
      #         is 0 to 100. Use the value of Target to specify whether you
      #         want Elastic Transcoder to include the black bars that are

      #         proportions of the watermark and the values of MaxWidth and
      #         MaxHeight are different, the watermark will be distorted.
      #         ShrinkToFit: Elastic Transcoder scales the watermark down so

      #         edge of the watermark is aligned with the right border of the
      #         video. Center: The watermark is centered between the left and
      #         right borders.
      #       * `:horizontal_offset` - (String) The amount by which you want
      #         the horizontal position of the watermark to be offset from the
      #         position specified by HorizontalAlign: number of pixels (px):
      #         The minimum value is 0 pixels, and the maximum value is the
      #         value of MaxWidth. integer percentage (%): The range of valid
      #         values is 0 to 100. For example, if you specify Left for
      #         HorizontalAlign and 5px for HorizontalOffset, the left side of
      #         the watermark appears 5 pixels from the left border of the
      #         output video. HorizontalOffset is only valid when the value of
      #         HorizontalAlign is Left or Right. If you specify an offset that
      #         causes the watermark to extend beyond the left or right border
      #         and Elastic Transcoder has not added black bars, the watermark

      #         the watermark is aligned with the bottom border of the video.
      #         Center: The watermark is centered between the top and bottom
      #         borders.
      #       * `:vertical_offset` - (String) VerticalOffset The amount by
      #         which you want the vertical position of the watermark to be
      #         offset from the position specified by VerticalAlign: number of
      #         pixels (px): The minimum value is 0 pixels, and the maximum
      #         value is the value of MaxHeight. integer percentage (%): The
      #         range of valid values is 0 to 100. For example, if you specify

      #         the watermark appears 5 pixels from the top border of the
      #         output video. VerticalOffset is only valid when the value of
      #         VerticalAlign is Top or Bottom. If you specify an offset that
      #         causes the watermark to extend beyond the top or bottom border
      #         and Elastic Transcoder has not added black bars, the watermark

      #         to specify whether you want Elastic Transcoder to include the
      #         black bars that are added by Elastic Transcoder, if any, in the
      #         offset calculation.
      #       * `:opacity` - (String) A percentage that indicates how much you
      #         want a watermark to obscure the video in the location where it
      #         appears. Valid values are 0 (the watermark is invisible) to 100
      #         (the watermark completely obscures the video in the specified
      #         location). The datatype of Opacity is float. Elastic Transcoder
      #         supports transparent .png graphics. If you use a transparent
      #         .png, the transparent portion of the video appears as if you
      #         had specified a value of 0 for Opacity. The .jpg file format
      #         doesn't support transparency.
      #       * `:target` - (String) A value that determines how Elastic
      #         Transcoder interprets values that you specified for
      #         HorizontalOffset, VerticalOffset, MaxWidth, and MaxHeight:

      #         calculated based on the borders of the video excluding black
      #         bars added by Elastic Transcoder, if any. In addition, MaxWidth
      #         and MaxHeight, if specified as a percentage, are calculated
      #         based on the borders of the video excluding black bars added by
      #         Elastic Transcoder, if any. Frame: HorizontalOffset and
      #         VerticalOffset values are calculated based on the borders of
      #         the video including black bars added by Elastic Transcoder, if
      #         any. In addition, MaxWidth and MaxHeight, if specified as a

      #       thumbnails so they match the value that you specified in
      #       thumbnail MaxWidth or MaxHeight settings without exceeding the
      #       other value. Fill: Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails so they
      #       match the value that you specified in thumbnail MaxWidth or
      #       MaxHeight settings and matches or exceeds the other value.
      #       Elastic Transcoder centers the image in thumbnails and then crops
      #       in the dimension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value.
      #       Stretch: Elastic Transcoder stretches thumbnails to match the
      #       values that you specified for thumbnail MaxWidth and MaxHeight
      #       settings. If the relative proportions of the input video and
      #       thumbnails are different, the thumbnails will be distorted. Keep:
      #       Elastic Transcoder does not scale thumbnails. If either dimension
      #       of the input video exceeds the values that you specified for
      #       thumbnail MaxWidth and MaxHeight settings, Elastic Transcoder
      #       crops the thumbnails. ShrinkToFit: Elastic Transcoder scales
      #       thumbnails down so that their dimensions match the values that
      #       you specified for at least one of thumbnail MaxWidth and
      #       MaxHeight without exceeding either value. If you specify this
      #       option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale thumbnails up.
      #       ShrinkToFill: Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails down so that
      #       their dimensions match the values that you specified for at least
      #       one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without dropping below either
      #       value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not
      #       scale thumbnails up.
      #     * `:padding_policy` - (String) When you set PaddingPolicy to Pad,
      #       Elastic Transcoder may add black bars to the top and bottom

      #       of the thumbnails match the values that you specified for
      #       thumbnail MaxWidth and MaxHeight settings.
