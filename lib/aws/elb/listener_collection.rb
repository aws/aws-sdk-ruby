      # @option options [Integer] :instance_port Specifies the TCP port on
      #   which the instance server is listening. This property cannot be
      #   modified for the life of the load balancer.
      #
      # @option options [String,Symbol] :instance_protocol Specifies the
      #   protocol to use for routing traffic to back-end instances.  Valid
      #   values include:
      #
      #   * :http, 'HTTP'

      #   if the front-end protocol is TCP or SSL, +:instance_protocol+ has
      #   to be TCP or SSL.
      #
      #   NOTE: If there is another listener with the same +:instance_port+
      #   whose +:instance_protocol+ is secure, i.e., HTTPS or SSL, the
      #   listener's +:instance_protocol+ has to be secure, i.e., HTTPS
      #   or SSL. If there is another listener with the same +:instance_port+
      #   whose +:instance_protocol+ is HTTP or TCP, the listener's
      #   +:instance_protocol+ must be either HTTP or TCP.
