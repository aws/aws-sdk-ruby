  # This class is the starting point for working with Amazon Glacier.
  #
  # To use Amazon Glacier you must first
  # [sign up here](http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/).

  #
  # # Credentials
  #
  # You can setup default credentials for all AWS services via
  # AWS.config:
  #
  #     AWS.config(
  #       :access_key_id => 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
  #       :secret_access_key => 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
  #
  # Or you can set them directly on the AWS::Glacier interface:
  #
  #     glacier = AWS::Glacier.new(
  #       :access_key_id => 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
  #       :secret_access_key => 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
  #
  # See {Client} for documentation on all of the supported API operations.
  #
  # @!attribute [r] client
  #   @return [Client] the low-level Glacier client object
