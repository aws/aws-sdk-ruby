  is the current Amazon Linux version. For more information on the supported operating
  systems, see AWS OpsWorks Operating Systems.\n  * `:hostname_theme` - (String) The
  stack's host name theme, with spaces replaced by underscores. The theme is used
  to generate host names for the stack's instances. By default, HostnameTheme is set
  to Layer_Dependent, which creates host names by appending integers to the layer's
  short name. The other themes are: Baked_Goods Clouds Europe_Cities Fruits Greek_Deities

  default VPC subnet ID. This parameter is required if you specify a value for the
  VpcId parameter. All instances are launched into this subnet unless you specify
  otherwise when you create the instance. If you also specify a value for DefaultAvailabilityZone,
  the subnet must be in that zone. For information on default values and when this
  parameter is required, see the VpcId parameter description.\n  * `:custom_json`
  - (String) A string that contains user-defined, custom JSON. It can be used to override
  the corresponding default stack configuration attribute values or to pass data to
  recipes. The string should be in the following escape characters such as '\"': \"{\\\"key1\\\":
  \\\"value1\\\", \\\"key2\\\": \\\"value2\\\",...}\" For more information on custom
  JSON, see Use Custom JSON to Modify the Stack Configuration Attributes.\n  * `:configuration_manager`

  - (Boolean) Whether to associate the AWS OpsWorks built-in security groups with
  the stack's layers. AWS OpsWorks provides a standard set of built-in security groups,
  one for each layer, which are associated with layers by default. With UseOpsworksSecurityGroups
  you can instead provide your own custom security groups. UseOpsworksSecurityGroups
  has the following settings: True - AWS OpsWorks automatically associates the appropriate
  built-in security group with each layer (default setting). You can associate additional
  security groups with a layer after you create it, but you cannot delete the built-in
  security group. False - AWS OpsWorks does not associate built-in security groups
  with layers. You must create appropriate EC2 security groups and associate a security
  group with each layer that you create. However, you can still manually associate
  a built-in security group with a layer on creation; custom security groups are required
  only for those layers that need custom settings. For more information, see Create
  a New Stack.\n  * `:custom_cookbooks_source` - (Hash) \n    * `:type` - (String)
  The repository type.  Valid values include:\n      * `git`\n      * `svn`\n      *

  (String) When included in a request, the parameter depends on the repository type.
  For Amazon S3 bundles, set Password to the appropriate IAM secret access key. For
  HTTP bundles and Subversion repositories, set Password to the password. For more
  information on how to safely handle IAM credentials, see . In responses, AWS OpsWorks
  returns *****FILTERED***** instead of the actual value.\n    * `:ssh_key` - (String)
  In requests, the repository's SSH key. In responses, AWS OpsWorks returns *****FILTERED*****
  instead of the actual value.\n    * `:revision` - (String) The application's version.
  AWS OpsWorks enables you to easily deploy new versions of an application. One of
  the simplest approaches is to have branches or revisions in your repository that
  represent different versions that can potentially be deployed.\n  * `:default_ssh_key_name`
  - (String) A default Amazon EC2 key pair name. The default value is none. If you
  specify a key pair name, AWS OpsWorks installs the public key on the instance and
  you can use the private key with an SSH client to log in to the instance. For more
  information, see Using SSH to Communicate with an Instance and Managing SSH Access.
  You can override this setting by specifying a different key pair, or no key pair,
  when you create an instance.\n  * `:default_root_device_type` - (String) The default
  root device type. This value is the default for all instances in the stack, but
  you can override it when you create an instance. The default option is instance-store.
  For more information, see Storage for the Root Device.  Valid values include:\n
  \   * `ebs`\n    * `instance-store`\n  * `:agent_version` - (String) The default
  AWS OpsWorks agent version. You have the following options: Auto-update - Set this
  parameter to LATEST. AWS OpsWorks automatically installs new agent versions on the
  stack's instances as soon as they are available. Fixed version - Set this parameter
  to your preferred agent version. To update the agent version, you must edit the
  stack configuration and specify a new version. AWS OpsWorks then automatically installs
  that version on the stack's instances. The default setting is LATEST. To specify
  an agent version, you must use the complete version number, not the abbreviated
  number shown on the console. For a list of available agent version numbers, call
  DescribeAgentVersions. You can also specify an agent version when you create or
  update an instance, which overrides the stack's default setting.\n@return [Core::Response]
