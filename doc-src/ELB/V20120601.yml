You have to include a ping path in the string. HTTP is specified as a HTTP:port;/;PathToPing; grouping, for example "HTTP:80/weather/us/wa/seattle". In this case, a HTTP GET request is issued to the instance on the given port and path. Any answer other than "200 OK" within the timeout period is considered unhealthy.
