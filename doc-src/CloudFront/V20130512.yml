      * `:comment` - *required* - (String) Any comments you want to include about the origin access identity.

  you want to allow to create signed URLs for private content. If you want to require
  signed URLs in requests for objects in the target origin that match the PathPattern
  for this cache behavior, specify  `true`  for Enabled, and specify the applicable
  values for Quantity and Items. For more information, go to Using a Signed URL to
  Serve Private Content in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. If you don't want
  to require signed URLs in requests for objects that match PathPattern, specify  `false`
  \ for Enabled and 0 for Quantity. Omit Items. To add, change, or remove one or more
  trusted signers, change Enabled to  `true`  (if it's currently  `false` ), change
  Quantity as applicable, and specify all of the trusted signers that you want to
  include in the updated distribution.\n      * `:enabled` - *required* - (Boolean)
  Specifies whether you want to require end users to use signed URLs to access the
  files specified by PathPattern and TargetOriginId.\n      * `:quantity` - *required*
  - (Integer) The number of trusted signers for this cache behavior.\n      * `:items`
  - (Array&lt;String>) Optional: A complex type that contains trusted signers for
  this cache behavior. If Quantity is 0, you can omit Items.\n      * `:AwsAccountNumber`
  - (String) \n    * `:price_class` - *required* - (String) A complex type that contains
  information about price class for this streaming distribution.  Valid values include:\n

  `:enabled` - *required* - (Boolean) Whether the streaming distribution is enabled
  to accept end user requests for content.\n  * `:id` - *required* - (String) The
  streaming distribution's id.\n  * `:if_match` - (String) The value of the ETag header
  you received when retrieving the streaming distribution's configuration. For example:
