  a prefix, such as cooking/lasagna.mpg, include the prefix in the key. If the file
  isn't in the specified bucket, Elastic Transcoder returns an error.\n    * `:frame_rate`
  - (String) The frame rate of the input file. If you want Elastic Transcoder to automatically
  detect the frame rate of the input file, specify auto. If you want to specify the
  frame rate for the input file, enter one of the following values: 10, 15, 23.97,
  24, 25, 29.97, 30, 60 If you specify a value other than auto, Elastic Transcoder
  disables automatic detection of the frame rate.\n    * `:resolution` - (String)
  This value must be auto, which causes Elastic Transcoder to automatically detect
  the resolution of the input file.\n    * `:aspect_ratio` - (String) The aspect ratio
  of the input file. If you want Elastic Transcoder to automatically detect the aspect
  ratio of the input file, specify auto. If you want to specify the aspect ratio for

  - (String) The name to assign to the transcoded file. Elastic Transcoder saves the
  file in the Amazon S3 bucket specified by the OutputBucket object in the pipeline
  that is specified by the pipeline ID. If a file with the specified name already
  exists in the output bucket, the job fails.\n    * `:thumbnail_pattern` - (String)
  Whether you want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails for your videos and, if
  so, how you want Elastic Transcoder to name the files. If you don't want Elastic
  Transcoder to create thumbnails, specify \"\". If you do want Elastic Transcoder
  to create thumbnails, specify the information that you want to include in the file
  name for each thumbnail. You can specify the following values in any sequence: `{count}`
  (Required): If you want to create thumbnails, you must include `{count}` in the
  ThumbnailPattern object. Wherever you specify `{count}`, Elastic Transcoder adds
  a five-digit sequence number (beginning with 00001) to thumbnail file names. The
  number indicates where a given thumbnail appears in the sequence of thumbnails for
  a transcoded file. If you specify a literal value and/or `{resolution}` but you
  omit `{count}`, Elastic Transcoder returns a validation error and does not create
  the job. Literal values (Optional): You can specify literal values anywhere in the
  ThumbnailPattern object. For example, you can include them as a file name prefix
  or as a delimiter between `{resolution}` and `{count}`. `{resolution}` (Optional):
  If you want Elastic Transcoder to include the resolution in the file name, include
  `{resolution}` in the ThumbnailPattern object. When creating thumbnails, Elastic
  Transcoder automatically saves the files in the format (.jpg or .png) that appears
  in the preset that you specified in the PresetID value of CreateJobOutput. Elastic
  Transcoder also appends the applicable file name extension.\n    * `:rotate` - (String)
  The number of degrees clockwise by which you want Elastic Transcoder to rotate the

  `:preset_watermark_id` - (String) The ID of the watermark settings that Elastic
  Transcoder uses to add watermarks to the video during transcoding. The settings
  are in the preset specified by Preset for the current output. In that preset, the
  value of Watermarks Id tells Elastic Transcoder which settings to use.\n      *
  `:input_key` - (String) The name of the .png or .jpg file that you want to use for
  the watermark. To determine which Amazon S3 bucket contains the specified file,
  Elastic Transcoder checks the pipeline specified by Pipeline; the Input Bucket object
  in that pipeline identifies the bucket. If the file name includes a prefix, for
  example, logos/128x64.png, include the prefix in the key. If the file isn't in the
  specified bucket, Elastic Transcoder returns an error.\n    * `:album_art` - (Hash)

  scaling of the output album art: Fit: Elastic Transcoder scales the output art so
  it matches the value that you specified in either MaxWidth or MaxHeight without
  exceeding the other value. Fill: Elastic Transcoder scales the output art so it
  matches the value that you specified in either MaxWidth or MaxHeight and matches
  or exceeds the other value. Elastic Transcoder centers the output art and then crops
  it in the dimension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value. Stretch: Elastic Transcoder
  stretches the output art to match the values that you specified for MaxWidth and
  MaxHeight. If the relative proportions of the input art and the output art are different,
  the output art will be distorted. Keep: Elastic Transcoder does not scale the output
  art. If either dimension of the input art exceeds the values that you specified
  for MaxWidth and MaxHeight, Elastic Transcoder crops the output art. ShrinkToFit:
  Elastic Transcoder scales the output art down so that its dimensions match the values
  that you specified for at least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without exceeding
  either value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale the
  art up. ShrinkToFill Elastic Transcoder scales the output art down so that its dimensions
  match the values that you specified for at least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without
  dropping below either value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does
  not scale the art up.\n        * `:padding_policy` - (String) When you set PaddingPolicy
  to Pad, Elastic Transcoder may add white bars to the top and bottom and/or left
  and right sides of the output album art to make the total size of the output art

  for a single clip per output file. The Composition object cannot be null.\n    *
  `:member` - (Hash) \n      * `:time_span` - (Hash) Settings that determine when
  a clip begins and how long it lasts.\n        * `:start_time` - (String) The place
  in the input file where you want a clip to start. The format can be either HH:mm:ss.SSS
  (maximum value: 23:59:59.999; SSS is thousandths of a second) or sssss.SSS (maximum
  value: 86399.999). If you don't specify a value, Elastic Transcoder starts at the
  beginning of the input file.\n        * `:duration` - (String) The duration of the
  clip. The format can be either HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum value: 23:59:59.999; SSS is
  thousandths of a second) or sssss.SSS (maximum value: 86399.999). If you don't specify
  a value, Elastic Transcoder creates an output file from StartTime to the end of
  the file. If you specify a value longer than the duration of the input file, Elastic
  Transcoder transcodes the file and returns a warning message.\n    * `:captions`
  - (Hash) You can configure Elastic Transcoder to transcode captions, or subtitles,
  from one format to another. All captions must be in UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder supports
  two types of captions: Embedded: Embedded captions are included in the same file

  language, to a maximum of 300 embedded captions per file. Valid input values include:
  CEA-608 (EIA-608, first non-empty channel only), CEA-708 (EIA-708, first non-empty
  channel only), and mov-text Valid outputs include: mov-text Elastic Transcoder supports
  a maximum of one embedded format per output. Sidecar: Sidecar captions are kept
  in a separate metadata file from the audio and video data. Sidecar captions require
  a player that is capable of understanding the relationship between the video file
  and the sidecar file. Elastic Transcoder supports only one sidecar caption per language,
  to a maximum of 20 sidecar captions per file. Valid input values include: dfxp (first
  div element only), ebu-tt, scc, smpt, srt, ttml (first div element only), and webvtt
  Valid outputs include: dfxp (first div element only), scc, srt, and webvtt. If you
  want ttml or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify dfxp as your output format. Elastic
  Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical Character Recognition), does not accept
  pictures as a valid input for captions, and is not available for audio-only transcoding.
  Elastic Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for example, italics) during
  the transcoding process. To remove captions or leave the captions empty, set Captions
  to null. To pass through existing captions unchanged, set the MergePolicy to MergeRetain,
  and pass in a null CaptionSources array. For more information on embedded files,
  see the Subtitles Wikipedia page. For more information on sidecar files, see the
  Extensible Metadata Platform and Sidecar file Wikipedia pages.\n      * `:merge_policy`
  - (String) A policy that determines how Elastic Transcoder handles the existence
  of multiple captions. MergeOverride: Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embedded
  and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for a language are embedded in the
  input file and also appear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the sidecar
  captions and ignores the embedded captions for that language. MergeRetain: Elastic
  Transcoder transcodes both embedded and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions
  for a language are embedded in the input file and also appear in a sidecar file,
  Elastic Transcoder uses the embedded captions and ignores the sidecar captions for
  that language. If CaptionSources is empty, Elastic Transcoder omits all sidecar
  captions from the output files. Override: Elastic Transcoder transcodes only the
  sidecar captions that you specify in CaptionSources. MergePolicy cannot be null.\n
  \     * `:caption_sources` - (Array&lt;Hash>) Source files for the input sidecar
  captions used during the transcoding process. To omit all sidecar captions, leave

  ISO 639-2 code For more information on ISO language codes and language names, see
  the List of ISO 639-1 codes.\n        * `:time_offset` - (String) For clip generation
  or captions that do not start at the same time as the associated video file, the
  TimeOffset tells Elastic Transcoder how much of the video to encode before including
  captions. Specify the TimeOffset in the form [+-]SS.sss or [+-]HH:mm:SS.ss.\n        *
  `:label` - (String) The label of the caption shown in the player when choosing a
  language. We recommend that you put the caption language name here, in the language
  of the captions.\n      * `:caption_formats` - (Array&lt;Hash>) The array of file
  formats for the output captions. If you leave this value blank, Elastic Transcoder
  returns an error.\n      * `:member` - (Hash) \n        * `:format` - (String) The
  format you specify determines whether Elastic Transcoder generates an embedded or
  sidecar caption for this output. Valid Embedded Caption Formats: For MP3: None For
  MP4: mov-text For MPEG-TS: None For ogg: None For webm: None Valid Sidecar Caption
  Formats: Elastic Transcoder supports dfxp (first div element only), scc, srt, and
  webvtt. There are no container restrictions on sidecar captions. If you want ttml
  or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify dfxp as your output format.\n        *
  `:pattern` - (String) The prefix for caption filenames, in the form description-`{language}`,
  where: description is a description of the video. `{language}` is a literal value
  that Elastic Transcoder replaces with the two- or three-letter code for the language
  of the caption in the output file names. If you don't include `{language}` in the
  file name pattern, Elastic Transcoder automatically appends \"`{language}`\" to
  the value that you specify for the description. In addition, Elastic Transcoder
  automatically appends the count to the end of the segment files. For example, suppose
  you're transcoding into srt format. When you enter \"Sydney-`{language}`-sunrise\",
  and the language of the captions is English (en), the name of the first caption
  file will be Sydney-en-sunrise00000.srt.\n  * `:outputs` - (Array&lt;Hash>) A section
  of the request body that provides information about the transcoded (target) files.
  We recommend that you use the Outputs syntax instead of the Output syntax.\n  *
  `:member` - (Hash) \n    * `:key` - (String) The name to assign to the transcoded
  file. Elastic Transcoder saves the file in the Amazon S3 bucket specified by the

  file name pattern, Elastic Transcoder automatically appends \"`{language}`\" to
  the value that you specify for the description. In addition, Elastic Transcoder
  automatically appends the count to the end of the segment files. For example, suppose
  you're transcoding into srt format. When you enter \"Sydney-`{language}`-sunrise\",

  .m3u8 to the file name. If you include .m3u8 in Name, it will appear twice in the
  file name.\n    * `:format` - (String) This value must currently be HLSv3.\n    *
  `:output_keys` - (Array&lt;String>) For each output in this job that you want to

  Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks depends on the value of the Level
  object. See the list below. (A macroblock is a block of pixels measuring 16x16.)
  1 - 396 1b - 396 1.1 - 900 1.2 - 2376 1.3 - 2376 2 - 2376 2.1 - 4752 2.2 - 8100
  3 - 8100 3.1 - 18000 3.2 - 20480 4 - 32768 4.1 - 32768 MaxBitRate The maximum number
  of bits per second in a video buffer; the size of the buffer is specified by BufferSize.
  Specify a value between 16 and 62,500. You can reduce the bandwidth required to
  stream a video by reducing the maximum bit rate, but this also reduces the quality
  of the video. BufferSize The maximum number of bits in any x seconds of the output
  video. This window is commonly 10 seconds, the standard segment duration when you're
  using MPEG-TS for the container type of the output video. Specify an integer greater
  than 0. If you specify MaxBitRate and omit BufferSize, Elastic Transcoder sets BufferSize
  to 10 times the value of MaxBitRate.\n    * `:value` - (String) \n    * `:keyframes_max_dist`
  - (String) The maximum number of frames between key frames. Key frames are fully
  encoded frames; the frames between key frames are encoded based, in part, on the
  content of the key frames. The value is an integer formatted as a string; valid
  values are between 1 (every frame is a key frame) and 100000, inclusive. A higher
  value results in higher compression but may also discernibly decrease video quality.\n
  \   * `:fixed_gop` - (String) Whether to use a fixed value for FixedGOP. Valid values
  are  `true`  and  `false` :  `true` : Elastic Transcoder uses the value of KeyframesMaxDist
  for the distance between key frames (the number of frames in a group of pictures,
  or GOP).  `false` : The distance between key frames can vary.\n    * `:bit_rate`
  - (String) The bit rate of the video stream in the output file, in kilobits/second.
  Valid values depend on the values of Level and Profile. If you specify auto, Elastic
  Transcoder uses the detected bit rate of the input source. If you specify a value
  other than auto, we recommend that you specify a value less than or equal to the
  maximum H.264-compliant value listed for your level and profile: Level - Maximum
  video bit rate in kilobits/second (baseline and main Profile) : maximum video bit
  rate in kilobits/second (high Profile) 1 - 64 : 80 1b - 128 : 160 1.1 - 192 : 240
  1.2 - 384 : 480 1.3 - 768 : 960 2 - 2000 : 2500 3 - 10000 : 12500 3.1 - 14000 :
  17500 3.2 - 20000 : 25000 4 - 20000 : 25000 4.1 - 50000 : 62500\n    * `:frame_rate`
  - (String) The frames per second for the video stream in the output file. Valid
  values include: auto, 10, 15, 23.97, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 60 If you specify auto,
  Elastic Transcoder uses the detected frame rate of the input source. If you specify
  a frame rate, we recommend that you perform the following calculation: Frame rate
  = maximum recommended decoding speed in luma samples/second / (width in pixels *
  height in pixels) where: width in pixels and height in pixels represent the Resolution
  of the output video. maximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second is
  less than or equal to the maximum value listed in the following table, based on
  the value that you specified for Level. The maximum recommended decoding speed in
  Luma samples/second for each level is described in the following list (Level - Decoding
  speed): 1 - 380160 1b - 380160 1.1 - 76800 1.2 - 1536000 1.3 - 3041280 2 - 3041280
  2.1 - 5068800 2.2 - 5184000 3 - 10368000 3.1 - 27648000 3.2 - 55296000 4 - 62914560
  4.1 - 62914560\n    * `:max_frame_rate` - (String) If you specify auto for FrameRate,
  Elastic Transcoder uses the frame rate of the input video for the frame rate of
  the output video. Specify the maximum frame rate that you want Elastic Transcoder
  to use when the frame rate of the input video is greater than the desired maximum
  frame rate of the output video. Valid values include: 10, 15, 23.97, 24, 25, 29.97,
  30, 60.\n    * `:resolution` - (String) To better control resolution and aspect
  ratio of output videos, we recommend that you use the values MaxWidth, MaxHeight,
  SizingPolicy, PaddingPolicy, and DisplayAspectRatio instead of Resolution and AspectRatio.
  The two groups of settings are mutually exclusive. Do not use them together. The
  width and height of the video in the output file, in pixels. Valid values are auto
  and width x height: auto: Elastic Transcoder attempts to preserve the width and
  height of the input file, subject to the following rules. width x height: The width
  and height of the output video in pixels. Note the following about specifying the
  width and height: The width must be an even integer between 128 and 4096, inclusive.
  The height must be an even integer between 96 and 3072, inclusive. If you specify
  a resolution that is less than the resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder
  rescales the output file to the lower resolution. If you specify a resolution that
  is greater than the resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the
  output to the higher resolution. We recommend that you specify a resolution for
  which the product of width and height is less than or equal to the applicable value
  in the following list (List - Max width x height value): 1 - 25344 1b - 25344 1.1
  - 101376 1.2 - 101376 1.3 - 101376 2 - 101376 2.1 - 202752 2.2 - 404720 3 - 404720
  3.1 - 921600 3.2 - 1310720 4 - 2097152 4.1 - 2097152\n    * `:aspect_ratio` - (String)
  To better control resolution and aspect ratio of output videos, we recommend that
  you use the values MaxWidth, MaxHeight, SizingPolicy, PaddingPolicy, and DisplayAspectRatio
  instead of Resolution and AspectRatio. The two groups of settings are mutually exclusive.
  Do not use them together. The display aspect ratio of the video in the output file.
  Valid values include: auto, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder
  tries to preserve the aspect ratio of the input file. If you specify an aspect ratio
  for the output file that differs from aspect ratio of the input file, Elastic Transcoder
  adds pillarboxing (black bars on the sides) or letterboxing (black bars on the top
  and bottom) to maintain the aspect ratio of the active region of the video.\n    *
  `:max_width` - (String) The maximum width of the output video in pixels. If you
  specify auto, Elastic Transcoder uses 1920 (Full HD) as the default value. If you
  specify a numeric value, enter an even integer between 128 and 4096.\n    * `:max_height`
  - (String) The maximum height of the output video in pixels. If you specify auto,
  Elastic Transcoder uses 1080 (Full HD) as the default value. If you specify a numeric
  value, enter an even integer between 96 and 3072.\n    * `:display_aspect_ratio`
  - (String) The value that Elastic Transcoder adds to the metadata in the output
  file.\n    * `:sizing_policy` - (String) Specify one of the following values to
  control scaling of the output video: Fit: Elastic Transcoder scales the output video
  so it matches the value that you specified in either MaxWidth or MaxHeight without
  exceeding the other value. Fill: Elastic Transcoder scales the output video so it
  matches the value that you specified in either MaxWidth or MaxHeight and matches
  or exceeds the other value. Elastic Transcoder centers the output video and then
  crops it in the dimension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value. Stretch: Elastic
  Transcoder stretches the output video to match the values that you specified for
  MaxWidth and MaxHeight. If the relative proportions of the input video and the output
  video are different, the output video will be distorted. Keep: Elastic Transcoder
  does not scale the output video. If either dimension of the input video exceeds
  the values that you specified for MaxWidth and MaxHeight, Elastic Transcoder crops
  the output video. ShrinkToFit: Elastic Transcoder scales the output video down so
  that its dimensions match the values that you specified for at least one of MaxWidth
  and MaxHeight without exceeding either value. If you specify this option, Elastic
  Transcoder does not scale the video up. ShrinkToFill: Elastic Transcoder scales
  the output video down so that its dimensions match the values that you specified
  for at least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without dropping below either value.
  If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale the video up.\n    *
  `:padding_policy` - (String) When you set PaddingPolicy to Pad, Elastic Transcoder
  may add black bars to the top and bottom and/or left and right sides of the output
  video to make the total size of the output video match the values that you specified
  for MaxWidth and MaxHeight.\n    * `:watermarks` - (Array&lt;Hash>) Settings for
  the size, location, and opacity of graphics that you want Elastic Transcoder to
  overlay over videos that are transcoded using this preset. You can specify settings
  for up to four watermarks. Watermarks appear in the specified size and location,
  and with the specified opacity for the duration of the transcoded video. Watermarks
  can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want to display a watermark that is not rectangular,
  use the .png format, which supports transparency. When you create a job that uses
  this preset, you specify the .png or .jpg graphics that you want Elastic Transcoder
  to include in the transcoded videos. You can specify fewer graphics in the job than
  you specify watermark settings in the preset, which allows you to use the same preset
  for up to four watermarks that have different dimensions.\n    * `:member` - (Hash)
  \n      * `:id` - (String) A unique identifier for the settings for one watermark.
  The value of Id can be up to 40 characters long.\n      * `:max_width` - (String)
  The maximum width of the watermark in one of the following formats: number of pixels
  (px): The minimum value is 16 pixels, and the maximum value is the value of MaxWidth.
  integer percentage (%): The range of valid values is 0 to 100. Use the value of
  Target to specify whether you want Elastic Transcoder to include the black bars
  that are added by Elastic Transcoder, if any, in the calculation. If you specify
  the value in pixels, it must be less than or equal to the value of MaxWidth.\n      *
  `:max_height` - (String) The maximum height of the watermark in one of the following
  formats: number of pixels (px): The minimum value is 16 pixels, and the maximum
  value is the value of MaxHeight. integer percentage (%): The range of valid values
  is 0 to 100. Use the value of Target to specify whether you want Elastic Transcoder
  to include the black bars that are added by Elastic Transcoder, if any, in the calculation.
  If you specify the value in pixels, it must be less than or equal to the value of
  MaxHeight.\n      * `:sizing_policy` - (String) A value that controls scaling of
  the watermark: Fit: Elastic Transcoder scales the watermark so it matches the value
  that you specified in either MaxWidth or MaxHeight without exceeding the other value.
  Stretch: Elastic Transcoder stretches the watermark to match the values that you
  specified for MaxWidth and MaxHeight. If the relative proportions of the watermark
  and the values of MaxWidth and MaxHeight are different, the watermark will be distorted.
  ShrinkToFit: Elastic Transcoder scales the watermark down so that its dimensions
  match the values that you specified for at least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without
  exceeding either value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not
  scale the watermark up.\n      * `:horizontal_align` - (String) The horizontal position
  of the watermark unless you specify a non-zero value for HorizontalOffset: Left:
  The left edge of the watermark is aligned with the left border of the video. Right:
  The right edge of the watermark is aligned with the right border of the video. Center:
  The watermark is centered between the left and right borders.\n      * `:horizontal_offset`
  - (String) The amount by which you want the horizontal position of the watermark
  to be offset from the position specified by HorizontalAlign: number of pixels (px):
  The minimum value is 0 pixels, and the maximum value is the value of MaxWidth. integer
  percentage (%): The range of valid values is 0 to 100. For example, if you specify
  Left for HorizontalAlign and 5px for HorizontalOffset, the left side of the watermark
  appears 5 pixels from the left border of the output video. HorizontalOffset is only
  valid when the value of HorizontalAlign is Left or Right. If you specify an offset
  that causes the watermark to extend beyond the left or right border and Elastic
  Transcoder has not added black bars, the watermark is cropped. If Elastic Transcoder
  has added black bars, the watermark extends into the black bars. If the watermark
  extends beyond the black bars, it is cropped. Use the value of Target to specify
  whether you want to include the black bars that are added by Elastic Transcoder,
  if any, in the offset calculation.\n      * `:vertical_align` - (String) The vertical
  position of the watermark unless you specify a non-zero value for VerticalOffset:
  Top: The top edge of the watermark is aligned with the top border of the video.
  Bottom: The bottom edge of the watermark is aligned with the bottom border of the
  video. Center: The watermark is centered between the top and bottom borders.\n      *
  `:vertical_offset` - (String) VerticalOffset The amount by which you want the vertical
  position of the watermark to be offset from the position specified by VerticalAlign:
  number of pixels (px): The minimum value is 0 pixels, and the maximum value is the
  value of MaxHeight. integer percentage (%): The range of valid values is 0 to 100.
  For example, if you specify Top for VerticalAlign and 5px for VerticalOffset, the
  top of the watermark appears 5 pixels from the top border of the output video. VerticalOffset
  is only valid when the value of VerticalAlign is Top or Bottom. If you specify an
  offset that causes the watermark to extend beyond the top or bottom border and Elastic
  Transcoder has not added black bars, the watermark is cropped. If Elastic Transcoder
  has added black bars, the watermark extends into the black bars. If the watermark
  extends beyond the black bars, it is cropped. Use the value of Target to specify
  whether you want Elastic Transcoder to include the black bars that are added by
  Elastic Transcoder, if any, in the offset calculation.\n      * `:opacity` - (String)
  A percentage that indicates how much you want a watermark to obscure the video in
  the location where it appears. Valid values are 0 (the watermark is invisible) to
  100 (the watermark completely obscures the video in the specified location). The
  datatype of Opacity is float. Elastic Transcoder supports transparent .png graphics.
  If you use a transparent .png, the transparent portion of the video appears as if
  you had specified a value of 0 for Opacity. The .jpg file format doesn't support
  transparency.\n      * `:target` - (String) A value that determines how Elastic
  Transcoder interprets values that you specified for HorizontalOffset, VerticalOffset,
  MaxWidth, and MaxHeight: Content: HorizontalOffset and VerticalOffset values are
  calculated based on the borders of the video excluding black bars added by Elastic
  Transcoder, if any. In addition, MaxWidth and MaxHeight, if specified as a percentage,
  are calculated based on the borders of the video excluding black bars added by Elastic
  Transcoder, if any. Frame: HorizontalOffset and VerticalOffset values are calculated
  based on the borders of the video including black bars added by Elastic Transcoder,
  if any. In addition, MaxWidth and MaxHeight, if specified as a percentage, are calculated
  based on the borders of the video including black bars added by Elastic Transcoder,
  if any.\n  * `:audio` - (Hash) A section of the request body that specifies the
  audio parameters.\n    * `:codec` - (String) The audio codec for the output file.
  Valid values include aac, mp3, and vorbis.\n    * `:sample_rate` - (String) The
  sample rate of the audio stream in the output file, in Hertz. Valid values include:
  auto, 22050, 32000, 44100, 48000, 96000 If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder
  automatically detects the sample rate.\n    * `:bit_rate` - (String) The bit rate
  of the audio stream in the output file, in kilobits/second. Enter an integer between
  64 and 320, inclusive.\n    * `:channels` - (String) The number of audio channels
  in the output file. Valid values include: auto, 0, 1, 2 If you specify auto, Elastic
  Transcoder automatically detects the number of channels in the input file.\n    *
  `:codec_options` - (Hash) If you specified AAC for Audio:Codec, this is the AAC
  compression profile to use. Valid values include: auto, AAC-LC, HE-AAC, HE-AACv2
  If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder chooses a profile based on the bit rate
  of the output file.\n      * `:profile` - (String) You can only choose an audio
  profile when you specify AAC for the value of Audio:Codec. Specify the AAC profile
  for the output file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following profiles: auto: If
  you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder will select the profile based on the bit rate
  selected for the output file. AAC-LC: The most common AAC profile. Use for bitrates
  larger than 64 kbps. HE-AAC: Not supported on some older players and devices. Use
  for bitrates between 40 and 80 kbps. HE-AACv2: Not supported on some players and
  devices. Use for bitrates less than 48 kbps. If you created any presets before AAC
  profiles were added, Elastic Transcoder automatically updated your presets to use
  AAC-LC. You can change the value as required.\n  * `:thumbnails` - (Hash) A section
  of the request body that specifies the thumbnail parameters, if any.\n    * `:format`

  of settings are mutually exclusive. Do not use them together. The width and height
  of thumbnail files in pixels. Specify a value in the format width x height where
  both values are even integers. The values cannot exceed the width and height that
  you specified in the Video:Resolution object.\n    * `:aspect_ratio` - (String)
  To better control resolution and aspect ratio of thumbnails, we recommend that you
  use the values MaxWidth, MaxHeight, SizingPolicy, and PaddingPolicy instead of Resolution
  and AspectRatio. The two groups of settings are mutually exclusive. Do not use them
  together. The aspect ratio of thumbnails. Valid values include: auto, 1:1, 4:3,
  3:2, 16:9 If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder tries to preserve the aspect ratio
  of the video in the output file.\n    * `:max_width` - (String) The maximum width
  of thumbnails in pixels. If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder uses 1920 (Full
  HD) as the default value. If you specify a numeric value, enter an even integer
  between 32 and 4096.\n    * `:max_height` - (String) The maximum height of thumbnails
  in pixels. If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder uses 1080 (Full HD) as the default

  value that you specified in thumbnail MaxWidth or MaxHeight settings without exceeding
  the other value. Fill: Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails so they match the value
  that you specified in thumbnail MaxWidth or MaxHeight settings and matches or exceeds
  the other value. Elastic Transcoder centers the image in thumbnails and then crops
  in the dimension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value. Stretch: Elastic Transcoder
  stretches thumbnails to match the values that you specified for thumbnail MaxWidth
  and MaxHeight settings. If the relative proportions of the input video and thumbnails
