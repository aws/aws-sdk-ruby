  @param [Hash] options
    * `:id` - *required* - (String) The identifier of the job that you want to cancel. To get a list of the jobs (including their jobId) that have a status of Submitted, use the ListJobsByStatus API action.
  @return [Core::Response]
:create_job: "Calls the POST CreateJob API operation.\n@param [Hash] options\n  *
  `:pipeline_id` - (String) The Id of the pipeline that you want Elastic Transcoder
  to use for transcoding. The pipeline determines several settings, including the
  Amazon S3 bucket from which Elastic Transcoder gets the files to transcode and the
  bucket into which Elastic Transcoder puts the transcoded files.\n  * `:input` -
  (Hash) A section of the request body that provides information about the file that
  is being transcoded.\n    * `:key` - (String) The name of the file to transcode.
  Elsewhere in the body of the JSON block is the the ID of the pipeline to use for
  processing the job. The InputBucket object in that pipeline tells Elastic Transcoder
  which Amazon S3 bucket to get the file from. If the file name includes a prefix,
  such as cooking/lasagna.mpg, include the prefix in the key. If the file isn't in
  the specified bucket, Elastic Transcoder returns an error.\n    * `:frame_rate`
  - (String) The frame rate of the input file. If you want Elastic Transcoder to automatically
  detect the frame rate of the input file, specify auto. If you want to specify the
  frame rate for the input file, enter one of the following values: 10, 15, 23.97,
  24, 25, 29.97, 30, 60 If you specify a value other than auto, Elastic Transcoder
  disables automatic detection of the frame rate.\n    * `:resolution` - (String)
  This value must be auto, which causes Elastic Transcoder to automatically detect
  the resolution of the input file.\n    * `:aspect_ratio` - (String) The aspect ratio
  of the input file. If you want Elastic Transcoder to automatically detect the aspect
  ratio of the input file, specify auto. If you want to specify the aspect ratio for
  the output file, enter one of the following values: 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 If you specify
  a value other than auto, Elastic Transcoder disables automatic detection of the
  aspect ratio.\n    * `:interlaced` - (String) Whether the input file is interlaced.
  If you want Elastic Transcoder to automatically detect whether the input file is
  interlaced, specify auto. If you want to specify whether the input file is interlaced,
  enter one of the following values:  `true` ,  `false`  If you specify a value other
  than auto, Elastic Transcoder disables automatic detection of interlacing.\n    *
  `:container` - (String) The container type for the input file. If you want Elastic
  Transcoder to automatically detect the container type of the input file, specify
  auto. If you want to specify the container type for the input file, enter one of
  the following values: 3gp, asf, avi, divx, flv, mkv, mov, mp4, mpeg, mpeg-ps, mpeg-ts,
  mxf, ogg, vob, wav, webm\n  * `:output` - (Hash) \n    * `:key` - (String) The name
  to assign to the transcoded file. Elastic Transcoder saves the file in the Amazon
  S3 bucket specified by the OutputBucket object in the pipeline that is specified
  by the pipeline ID. If a file with the specified name already exists in the output
  bucket, the job fails.\n    * `:thumbnail_pattern` - (String) Whether you want Elastic
  Transcoder to create thumbnails for your videos and, if so, how you want Elastic
  Transcoder to name the files. If you don't want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails,
  specify \"\". If you do want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails, specify the
  information that you want to include in the file name for each thumbnail. You can
  specify the following values in any sequence: `{count}` (Required): If you want
  to create thumbnails, you must include `{count}` in the ThumbnailPattern object.
  Wherever you specify `{count}`, Elastic Transcoder adds a five-digit sequence number
  (beginning with 00001) to thumbnail file names. The number indicates where a given
  thumbnail appears in the sequence of thumbnails for a transcoded file. If you specify
  a literal value and/or `{resolution}` but you omit `{count}`, Elastic Transcoder
  returns a validation error and does not create the job. Literal values (Optional):
  You can specify literal values anywhere in the ThumbnailPattern object. For example,
  you can include them as a file name prefix or as a delimiter between `{resolution}`
  and `{count}`. `{resolution}` (Optional): If you want Elastic Transcoder to include
  the resolution in the file name, include `{resolution}` in the ThumbnailPattern
  object. When creating thumbnails, Elastic Transcoder automatically saves the files
  in the format (.jpg or .png) that appears in the preset that you specified in the
  PresetID value of CreateJobOutput. Elastic Transcoder also appends the applicable
  file name extension.\n    * `:rotate` - (String) The number of degrees clockwise
  by which you want Elastic Transcoder to rotate the output relative to the input.
  Enter one of the following values: auto, 0, 90, 180, 270. The value auto generally
  works only if the file that you're transcoding contains rotation metadata.\n    *
  `:preset_id` - (String) The Id of the preset to use for this job. The preset determines
  the audio, video, and thumbnail settings that Elastic Transcoder uses for transcoding.\n
  \   * `:segment_duration` - (String) If you specify a preset in PresetId for which
  the value of Container is ts (MPEG-TS), SegmentDuration is the duration of each
  .ts file in seconds. The range of valid values is 1 to 60 seconds.\n    * `:watermarks`
  - (Array&lt;Hash>) Information about the watermarks that you want Elastic Transcoder
  to add to the video during transcoding. You can specify up to four watermarks for
  each output. Settings for each watermark must be defined in the preset for the current
  output.\n    * `:member` - (Hash) \n      * `:preset_watermark_id` - (String) The
  ID of the watermark settings that Elastic Transcoder uses to add watermarks to the
  video during transcoding. The settings are in the preset specified by Preset for
  the current output. In that preset, the value of Watermarks Id tells Elastic Transcoder
  which settings to use.\n      * `:input_key` - (String) The name of the .png or
  .jpg file that you want to use for the watermark. To determine which Amazon S3 bucket
  contains the specified file, Elastic Transcoder checks the pipeline specified by
  Pipeline; the Input Bucket object in that pipeline identifies the bucket. If the
  file name includes a prefix, for example, logos/128x64.png, include the prefix in
  the key. If the file isn't in the specified bucket, Elastic Transcoder returns an
  error.\n  * `:outputs` - (Array&lt;Hash>) A section of the request body that provides
  information about the transcoded (target) files. We recommend that you use the Outputs
  syntax instead of the Output syntax.\n  * `:member` - (Hash) \n    * `:key` - (String)
  The name to assign to the transcoded file. Elastic Transcoder saves the file in
  the Amazon S3 bucket specified by the OutputBucket object in the pipeline that is
  specified by the pipeline ID. If a file with the specified name already exists in
  the output bucket, the job fails.\n    * `:thumbnail_pattern` - (String) Whether
  you want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails for your videos and, if so, how
  you want Elastic Transcoder to name the files. If you don't want Elastic Transcoder
  to create thumbnails, specify \"\". If you do want Elastic Transcoder to create
  thumbnails, specify the information that you want to include in the file name for
  each thumbnail. You can specify the following values in any sequence: `{count}`
  (Required): If you want to create thumbnails, you must include `{count}` in the
  ThumbnailPattern object. Wherever you specify `{count}`, Elastic Transcoder adds
  a five-digit sequence number (beginning with 00001) to thumbnail file names. The
  number indicates where a given thumbnail appears in the sequence of thumbnails for
  a transcoded file. If you specify a literal value and/or `{resolution}` but you
  omit `{count}`, Elastic Transcoder returns a validation error and does not create
  the job. Literal values (Optional): You can specify literal values anywhere in the
  ThumbnailPattern object. For example, you can include them as a file name prefix
  or as a delimiter between `{resolution}` and `{count}`. `{resolution}` (Optional):
  If you want Elastic Transcoder to include the resolution in the file name, include
  `{resolution}` in the ThumbnailPattern object. When creating thumbnails, Elastic
  Transcoder automatically saves the files in the format (.jpg or .png) that appears
  in the preset that you specified in the PresetID value of CreateJobOutput. Elastic
  Transcoder also appends the applicable file name extension.\n    * `:rotate` - (String)
  The number of degrees clockwise by which you want Elastic Transcoder to rotate the
  output relative to the input. Enter one of the following values: auto, 0, 90, 180,
  270. The value auto generally works only if the file that you're transcoding contains
  rotation metadata.\n    * `:preset_id` - (String) The Id of the preset to use for
  this job. The preset determines the audio, video, and thumbnail settings that Elastic
  Transcoder uses for transcoding.\n    * `:segment_duration` - (String) If you specify

  is the duration of each .ts file in seconds. The range of valid values is 1 to 60
  seconds.\n    * `:watermarks` - (Array&lt;Hash>) Information about the watermarks
  that you want Elastic Transcoder to add to the video during transcoding. You can
  specify up to four watermarks for each output. Settings for each watermark must
  be defined in the preset for the current output.\n    * `:member` - (Hash) \n      *
  `:preset_watermark_id` - (String) The ID of the watermark settings that Elastic
  Transcoder uses to add watermarks to the video during transcoding. The settings
  are in the preset specified by Preset for the current output. In that preset, the
  value of Watermarks Id tells Elastic Transcoder which settings to use.\n      *
  `:input_key` - (String) The name of the .png or .jpg file that you want to use for
  the watermark. To determine which Amazon S3 bucket contains the specified file,
  Elastic Transcoder checks the pipeline specified by Pipeline; the Input Bucket object
  in that pipeline identifies the bucket. If the file name includes a prefix, for
  example, logos/128x64.png, include the prefix in the key. If the file isn't in the
  specified bucket, Elastic Transcoder returns an error.\n  * `:output_key_prefix`
  - (String) The value, if any, that you want Elastic Transcoder to prepend to the
  names of all files that this job creates, including output files, thumbnails, and
  playlists.\n  * `:playlists` - (Array&lt;Hash>) If you specify a preset in PresetId
  for which the value of Container is ts (MPEG-TS), Playlists contains information
  about the master playlists that you want Elastic Transcoder to create. We recommend
  that you create only one master playlist. The maximum number of master playlists
  in a job is 30.\n  * `:member` - (Hash) \n    * `:name` - (String) The name that
  you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the master playlist, for example, nyc-vacation.m3u8.
  The name cannot include a / character. If you create more than one master playlist
  (not recommended), the values of all Name objects must be unique. Elastic Transcoder
  automatically appends .m3u8 to the file name. If you include .m3u8 in Name, it will
  appear twice in the file name.\n    * `:format` - (String) This value must currently
  be HLSv3.\n    * `:output_keys` - (Array&lt;String>) For each output in this job
  that you want to include in a master playlist, the value of the Outputs:Key object.
  If you include more than one output in a playlist, the value of SegmentDuration
  for all of the outputs must be the same.\n    * `:member` - (String) \n@return [Core::Response]

  0 through 16, but we recommend that you not use a value greater than the following:
  Min(Floor(Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks * 256 / (Width in pixels
  * Height in pixels)), 16) where Width in pixels and Height in pixels represent either
  MaxWidth and MaxHeight, or Resolution. Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks
  depends on the value of the Level object. See the list below. (A macroblock is a

  You can reduce the bandwidth required to stream a video by reducing the maximum
  bit rate, but this also reduces the quality of the video. BufferSize The maximum
  number of bits in any x seconds of the output video. This window is commonly 10
  seconds, the standard segment duration when you’re using MPEG-TS for the container
  type of the output video. Specify an integer greater than 0. If you specify MaxBitRate
  and omit BufferSize, Elastic Transcoder sets BufferSize to 10 times the value of
  MaxBitRate.\n    * `:value` - (String) \n    * `:keyframes_max_dist` - (String)
  The maximum number of frames between key frames. Key frames are fully encoded frames;
  the frames between key frames are encoded based, in part, on the content of the
  key frames. The value is an integer formatted as a string; valid values are between
  1 (every frame is a key frame) and 100000, inclusive. A higher value results in
  higher compression but may also discernibly decrease video quality.\n    * `:fixed_gop`
  - (String) Whether to use a fixed value for FixedGOP. Valid values are  `true`  and
  \ `false` :  `true` : Elastic Transcoder uses the value of KeyframesMaxDist for
  the distance between key frames (the number of frames in a group of pictures, or
  GOP).  `false` : The distance between key frames can vary.\n    * `:bit_rate` -
  (String) The bit rate of the video stream in the output file, in kilobits/second.
  Valid values depend on the values of Level and Profile. If you specify auto, Elastic
  Transcoder uses the detected bit rate of the input source. If you specify a value
  other than auto, we recommend that you specify a value less than or equal to the
  maximum H.264-compliant value listed for your level and profile: Level - Maximum
  video bit rate in kilobits/second (baseline and main Profile) : maximum video bit
  rate in kilobits/second (high Profile) 1 - 64 : 80 1b - 128 : 160 1.1 - 192 : 240

  values include: auto, 10, 15, 23.97, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 60 If you specify auto,
  Elastic Transcoder uses the detected frame rate of the input source. If you specify
  a frame rate, we recommend that you perform the following calculation: Frame rate
  = maximum recommended decoding speed in luma samples/second / (width in pixels *
  height in pixels) where: width in pixels and height in pixels represent the Resolution
  of the output video. maximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second is
  less than or equal to the maximum value listed in the following table, based on
  the value that you specified for Level. The maximum recommended decoding speed in
  Luma samples/second for each level is described in the following list (Level - Decoding
  speed): 1 - 380160 1b - 380160 1.1 - 76800 1.2 - 1536000 1.3 - 3041280 2 - 3041280

  4.1 - 62914560\n    * `:max_frame_rate` - (String) If you specify auto for FrameRate,
  Elastic Transcoder uses the frame rate of the input video for the frame rate of
  the output video. Specify the maximum frame rate that you want Elastic Transcoder
  to use when the frame rate of the input video is greater than the desired maximum
  frame rate of the output video. Valid values include: 10, 15, 23.97, 24, 25, 29.97,
  30, 60.\n    * `:resolution` - (String) To better control resolution and aspect
  ratio of output videos, we recommend that you use the values MaxWidth, MaxHeight,
  SizingPolicy, PaddingPolicy, and DisplayAspectRatio instead of Resolution and AspectRatio.
  The two groups of settings are mutually exclusive. Do not use them together. The
  width and height of the video in the output file, in pixels. Valid values are auto
  and width x height: auto: Elastic Transcoder attempts to preserve the width and
  height of the input file, subject to the following rules. width x height: The width
  and height of the output video in pixels. Note the following about specifying the
  width and height: The width must be an even integer between 128 and 4096, inclusive.
  The height must be an even integer between 96 and 3072, inclusive. If you specify
  a resolution that is less than the resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder
  rescales the output file to the lower resolution. If you specify a resolution that
  is greater than the resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the
  output to the higher resolution. We recommend that you specify a resolution for
  which the product of width and height is less than or equal to the applicable value
  in the following list (List - Max width x height value): 1 - 25344 1b - 25344 1.1

  To better control resolution and aspect ratio of output videos, we recommend that
  you use the values MaxWidth, MaxHeight, SizingPolicy, PaddingPolicy, and DisplayAspectRatio
  instead of Resolution and AspectRatio. The two groups of settings are mutually exclusive.
  Do not use them together. The display aspect ratio of the video in the output file.
  Valid values include: auto, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder
  tries to preserve the aspect ratio of the input file. If you specify an aspect ratio
  for the output file that differs from aspect ratio of the input file, Elastic Transcoder
  adds pillarboxing (black bars on the sides) or letterboxing (black bars on the top
  and bottom) to maintain the aspect ratio of the active region of the video.\n    *
  `:max_width` - (String) The maximum width of the output video in pixels. If you
  specify auto, Elastic Transcoder uses 1920 (Full HD) as the default value. If you
  specify a numeric value, enter an even integer between 128 and 4096.\n    * `:max_height`
  - (String) The maximum height of the output video in pixels. If you specify auto,
  Elastic Transcoder uses 1080 (Full HD) as the default value. If you specify a numeric
  value, enter an even integer between 96 and 3072.\n    * `:display_aspect_ratio`
  - (String) The value that Elastic Transcoder adds to the metadata in the output
  file.\n    * `:sizing_policy` - (String) Specify one of the following values to
  control scaling of the output video: Fit: Elastic Transcoder scales the output video
  so it matches the value that you specified in either MaxWidth or MaxHeight without
  exceeding the other value. Fill: Elastic Transcoder scales the output video so it
  matches the value that you specified in either MaxWidth or MaxHeight and matches
  or exceeds the other value. Elastic Transcoder centers the output video and then
  crops it in the dimension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value. Stretch: Elastic
  Transcoder stretches the output video to match the values that you specified for
  MaxWidth and MaxHeight. If the relative proportions of the input video and the output
  video are different, the output video will be distorted. Keep: Elastic Transcoder
  does not scale the output video. If either dimension of the input video exceeds
  the values that you specified for MaxWidth and MaxHeight, Elastic Transcoder crops
  the output video. ShrinkToFit: Elastic Transcoder scales the output video down so
  that its dimensions match the values that you specified for at least one of MaxWidth
  and MaxHeight without exceeding either value. If you specify this option, Elastic
  Transcoder does not scale the video up. ShrinkToFill: Elastic Transcoder scales
  the output video down so that its dimensions match the values that you specified
  for at least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without dropping below either value.
  If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale the video up.\n    *
  `:padding_policy` - (String) When you set PaddingPolicy to Pad, Elastic Transcoder
  may add black bars to the top and bottom and/or left and right sides of the output
  video to make the total size of the output video match the values that you specified
  for MaxWidth and MaxHeight.\n    * `:watermarks` - (Array&lt;Hash>) Settings for
  the size, location, and opacity of graphics that you want Elastic Transcoder to
  overlay over videos that are transcoded using this preset. You can specify settings
  for up to four watermarks. Watermarks appear in the specified size and location,
  and with the specified opacity for the duration of the transcoded video. Watermarks
  can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want to display a watermark that is not rectangular,
  use the .png format, which supports transparency. When you create a job that uses
  this preset, you specify the .png or .jpg graphics that you want Elastic Transcoder
  to include in the transcoded videos. You can specify fewer graphics in the job than
  you specify watermark settings in the preset, which allows you to use the same preset
  for up to four watermarks that have different dimensions.\n    * `:member` - (Hash)
  \n      * `:id` - (String) A unique identifier for the settings for one watermark.
  The value of Id can be up to 40 characters long.\n      * `:max_width` - (String)
  The maximum width of the watermark in one of the following formats: number of pixels
  (px): The minimum value is 16 pixels, and the maximum value is the value of MaxWidth.
  integer percentage (%): The range of valid values is 0 to 100. Use the value of
  Target to specify whether you want Elastic Transcoder to include the black bars
  that are added by Elastic Transcoder, if any, in the calculation. If you specify
  the value in pixels, it must be less than or equal to the value of MaxWidth.\n      *
  `:max_height` - (String) The maximum height of the watermark in one of the following
  formats: number of pixels (px): The minimum value is 16 pixels, and the maximum

  If you specify the value in pixels, it must be less than or equal to the value of
  MaxHeight.\n      * `:sizing_policy` - (String) A value that controls scaling of
  the watermark: Fit: Elastic Transcoder scales the watermark so it matches the value
  that you specified in either MaxWidth or MaxHeight without exceeding the other value.
  Stretch: Elastic Transcoder stretches the watermark to match the values that you
  specified for MaxWidth and MaxHeight. If the relative proportions of the watermark
  and the values of MaxWidth and MaxHeight are different, the watermark will be distorted.
  ShrinkToFit: Elastic Transcoder scales the watermark down so that its dimensions
  match the values that you specified for at least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without
  exceeding either value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not
  scale the watermark up.\n      * `:horizontal_align` - (String) The horizontal position
  of the watermark unless you specify a non-zero value for HorizontalOffset: Left:
  The left edge of the watermark is aligned with the left border of the video. Right:
  The right edge of the watermark is aligned with the right border of the video. Center:
  The watermark is centered between the left and right borders.\n      * `:horizontal_offset`
  - (String) The amount by which you want the horizontal position of the watermark
  to be offset from the position specified by HorizontalAlign: number of pixels (px):
  The minimum value is 0 pixels, and the maximum value is the value of MaxWidth. integer
  percentage (%): The range of valid values is 0 to 100. For example, if you specify
  Left for HorizontalAlign and 5px for HorizontalOffset, the left side of the watermark
  appears 5 pixels from the left border of the output video. HorizontalOffset is only
  valid when the value of HorizontalAlign is Left or Right. If you specify an offset
  that causes the watermark to extend beyond the left or right border and Elastic
  Transcoder has not added black bars, the watermark is cropped. If Elastic Transcoder
  has added black bars, the watermark extends into the black bars. If the watermark
  extends beyond the black bars, it is cropped. Use the value of Target to specify
  whether you want to include the black bars that are added by Elastic Transcoder,
  if any, in the offset calculation.\n      * `:vertical_align` - (String) The vertical
  position of the watermark unless you specify a non-zero value for VerticalOffset:
  Top: The top edge of the watermark is aligned with the top border of the video.
  Bottom: The bottom edge of the watermark is aligned with the bottom border of the
  video. Center: The watermark is centered between the top and bottom borders.\n      *
  `:vertical_offset` - (String) VerticalOffset The amount by which you want the vertical
  position of the watermark to be offset from the position specified by VerticalAlign:
  number of pixels (px): The minimum value is 0 pixels, and the maximum value is the
  value of MaxHeight. integer percentage (%): The range of valid values is 0 to 100.
  For example, if you specify Top for VerticalAlign and 5px for VerticalOffset, the
  top of the watermark appears 5 pixels from the top border of the output video. VerticalOffset
  is only valid when the value of VerticalAlign is Top or Bottom. If you specify an
  offset that causes the watermark to extend beyond the top or bottom border and Elastic
  Transcoder has not added black bars, the watermark is cropped. If Elastic Transcoder
  has added black bars, the watermark extends into the black bars. If the watermark
  extends beyond the black bars, it is cropped. Use the value of Target to specify
  whether you want Elastic Transcoder to include the black bars that are added by
  Elastic Transcoder, if any, in the offset calculation.\n      * `:opacity` - (String)
  A percentage that indicates how much you want a watermark to obscure the video in
  the location where it appears. Valid values are 0 (the watermark is invisible) to
  100 (the watermark completely obscures the video in the specified location). The
  datatype of Opacity is float. Elastic Transcoder supports transparent .png graphics.
  If you use a transparent .png, the transparent portion of the video appears as if
  you had specified a value of 0 for Opacity. The .jpg file format doesn't support
  transparency.\n      * `:target` - (String) A value that determines how Elastic
  Transcoder interprets values that you specified for HorizontalOffset, VerticalOffset,
  MaxWidth, and MaxHeight: Content: HorizontalOffset and VerticalOffset values are
  calculated based on the borders of the video excluding black bars added by Elastic
  Transcoder, if any. In addition, MaxWidth and MaxHeight, if specified as a percentage,
  are calculated based on the borders of the video excluding black bars added by Elastic
  Transcoder, if any. Frame: HorizontalOffset and VerticalOffset values are calculated
  based on the borders of the video including black bars added by Elastic Transcoder,
  if any. In addition, MaxWidth and MaxHeight, if specified as a percentage, are calculated
  based on the borders of the video including black bars added by Elastic Transcoder,
  if any.\n  * `:audio` - (Hash) A section of the request body that specifies the
  audio parameters.\n    * `:codec` - (String) The audio codec for the output file.
  This value must be AAC.\n    * `:sample_rate` - (String) The sample rate of the
  audio stream in the output file, in Hertz. Valid values include: auto, 22050, 32000,
  44100, 48000, 96000 If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder automatically detects
  the sample rate.\n    * `:bit_rate` - (String) The bit rate of the audio stream
  in the output file, in kilobits/second. Enter an integer between 64 and 320, inclusive.\n

  values include: auto, 0, 1, 2 If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder automatically
  detects the number of channels in the input file.\n  * `:thumbnails` - (Hash) A
  section of the request body that specifies the thumbnail parameters, if any.\n    *
  `:format` - (String) The format of thumbnails, if any. Valid values are jpg and
  png. You specify whether you want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails when you
  create a job.\n    * `:interval` - (String) The number of seconds between thumbnails.
  Specify an integer value.\n    * `:resolution` - (String) To better control resolution
  and aspect ratio of thumbnails, we recommend that you use the values MaxWidth, MaxHeight,
  SizingPolicy, and PaddingPolicy instead of Resolution and AspectRatio. The two groups
  of settings are mutually exclusive. Do not use them together. The width and height
  of thumbnail files in pixels. Specify a value in the format width x height where
  both values are even integers. The values cannot exceed the width and height that
  you specified in the Video:Resolution object.\n    * `:aspect_ratio` - (String)
  To better control resolution and aspect ratio of thumbnails, we recommend that you

  Storage Service Developer Guide. For more information about using CloudFront origin
  access identities to require that users use CloudFront URLs instead of Amazon S3
  URLs, see Using an Origin Access Identity to Restrict Access to Your Amazon S3 Content.
  A canonical user ID is not the same as an AWS account number. Email: The value in
  the Grantee object is the registered email address of an AWS account. Group: The
  value in the Grantee object is one of the following predefined Amazon S3 groups:
  AllUsers, AuthenticatedUsers, or LogDelivery. Grantee: The AWS user or group that

  S3 groups you want to have access to transcoded files and playlists, and the type
  of access you want them to have. You can grant permissions to a maximum of 30 users
  and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups. If you include Permissions, Elastic Transcoder
  grants only the permissions that you specify. It does not grant full permissions
  to the owner of the role specified by Role. If you want that user to have full control,
  you must explicitly grant full control to the user. If you omit Permissions, Elastic
  Transcoder grants full control over the transcoded files and playlists to the owner

  S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder to save thumbnail files, which users
  you want to have access to the files, the type of access you want users to have,
  and the storage class that you want to assign to the files. If you specify values
  for ContentConfig, you must also specify values for ThumbnailConfig even if you
  don't want to create thumbnails. If you specify values for ContentConfig and ThumbnailConfig,
  omit the OutputBucket object. Bucket: The Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic
  Transcoder to save thumbnail files. Permissions (Optional): The Permissions object
  specifies which users and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups you want to have access
  to thumbnail files, and the type of access you want them to have. You can grant
  permissions to a maximum of 30 users and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups. GranteeType:

  in the Grantee object is either the canonical user ID for an AWS account or an origin
  access identity for an Amazon CloudFront distribution. A canonical user ID is not
  the same as an AWS account number. Email: The value in the Grantee object is the
  registered email address of an AWS account. Group: The value in the Grantee object
  is one of the following predefined Amazon S3 groups: AllUsers, AuthenticatedUsers,

  files. To identify the user or group, you can specify the canonical user ID for
  an AWS account, an origin access identity for a CloudFront distribution, the registered
  email address of an AWS account, or a predefined Amazon S3 group. Access: The permission
  that you want to give to the AWS user that you specified in Grantee. Permissions
  are granted on the thumbnail files that Elastic Transcoder adds to the bucket. Valid
  values include: READ: The grantee can read the thumbnails and metadata for objects
  that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket. READ_ACP: The grantee can
  read the object ACL for thumbnails that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3
  bucket. WRITE_ACP: The grantee can write the ACL for the thumbnails that Elastic

  and WRITE_ACP permissions for the thumbnails that Elastic Transcoder adds to the
  Amazon S3 bucket. StorageClass: The Amazon S3 storage class, Standard or ReducedRedundancy,
  that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the thumbnails that it stores in your
  Amazon S3 bucket.\n    * `:bucket` - (String) The Amazon S3 bucket in which you
  want Elastic Transcoder to save the transcoded files. Specify this value when all
  of the following are  `true` : You want to save transcoded files, thumbnails (if
  any), and playlists (if any) together in one bucket. You do not want to specify
  the users or groups who have access to the transcoded files, thumbnails, and playlists.
  You do not want to specify the permissions that Elastic Transcoder grants to the
  files. You want to associate the transcoded files and thumbnails with the Amazon
  S3 Standard storage class. If you want to save transcoded files and playlists in
  one bucket and thumbnails in another bucket, specify which users can access the
  transcoded files or the permissions the users have, or change the Amazon S3 storage
  class, omit OutputBucket and specify values for ContentConfig and ThumbnailConfig
  instead.\n    * `:storage_class` - (String) The Amazon S3 storage class, Standard
  or ReducedRedundancy, that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the video files
  and playlists that it stores in your Amazon S3 bucket.\n    * `:permissions` - (Array&lt;Hash>)
  Optional. The Permissions object specifies which users and/or predefined Amazon
  S3 groups you want to have access to transcoded files and playlists, and the type
  of access you want them to have. You can grant permissions to a maximum of 30 users
  and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups. If you include Permissions, Elastic Transcoder
  grants only the permissions that you specify. It does not grant full permissions
  to the owner of the role specified by Role. If you want that user to have full control,
  you must explicitly grant full control to the user. If you omit Permissions, Elastic
  Transcoder grants full control over the transcoded files and playlists to the owner
  of the role specified by Role, and grants no other permissions to any other user
  or group.\n    * `:member` - (Hash) \n      * `:grantee_type` - (String) The type
