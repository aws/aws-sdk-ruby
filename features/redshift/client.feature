Feature: Redshift Client

  Scenario: DescribeClusters
    When I call #describe_clusters on the client
    Then I should get back a list of clusters
    And a request should have been made like:
    | TYPE   | NAME   | VALUE            |
    | http   | verb   | POST             |
    | http   | uri    | /                |
    | param  | Action | DescribeClusters |

  Scenario: Creating and deleting cluster security groups
    Given I create a Redshift cluster security group with prefix name "aws-js-sdk"
    And the Redshift cluster security group name is in the result
    And I describe Redshift cluster security groups
    Then the Redshift cluster security group should be in the list
    And I delete the Redshift cluster security group

  Scenario: Error handling
    Given I create a Redshift cluster security group with prefix name ""
    Then the error code should be "InvalidParameterValue"
    Then the error message should be:
    """
    ClusterSecurityGroupName is required
    """
