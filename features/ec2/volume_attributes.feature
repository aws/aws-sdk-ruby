Feature: Volume attributes

  As a user of the high-level interface for EC2
  I want to read attributes of volumes
  So that I can better manage my EBS volumes.

  Scenario: Get volume size
    Given I create a volume with the following parameters:
    | parameter         | value      |
    | size              | 1          |
    | availability_zone | us-east-1a |
    Then the volume size should be 1

  Scenario: Get volume snapshot ID
    Given I create a snapshot
    When I create a volume from the snapshot
    Then the volume snapshot should match the snapshot it was created from

  Scenario: Get volume availability zone
    Given I create a volume with the following parameters:
    | parameter         | value      |
    | size              | 1          |
    | availability_zone | us-east-1a |
    Then the volume availability zone should be "us-east-1a"

  Scenario: Get volume create time
    Given I create a volume
    Then the volume create time should be within an hour of now
