Feature: EC2 Reserved Instances

  As a user of the high-level interface for EC2
  I want to describe and purchase reserved instance offerings
  So that I can save money

  Scenario: Describing reserved instance offerings
    When I enumerate reserved instance offerings
    Then a request should have been made like:
    | TYPE  | NAME       | VALUE                              |
    | param | Action     | DescribeReservedInstancesOfferings |

  @memoized
  Scenario: Describing reserved instance offerings with memoization
    Given I start a memoization block
    And I find the cheapest fixed price for a Linux/UNIX reserved instance
    And I find the most expensive fixed price for a Linux/UNIX reserved instance
    Then exactly 1 request should have been made like:
    | TYPE  | NAME   | VALUE                              |
    | param | Action | DescribeReservedInstancesOfferings |

  Scenario: Filtering reserved instances offerings
    When I get a list of reserved instances offerings like:
    """
      @ec2.reserved_instances_offerings.filter('instance-type', 'm1.small').to_a
    """
    Then a request should have been made like:
    | TYPE  | NAME       | VALUE                              |
    | param | Action     | DescribeReservedInstancesOfferings |
    | param | Filter.1.Value.1 | m1.small                     |
    | param | Filter.1.Name    | instance-type                |
