Feature: Availability Zones

  As a user of the high-level interface for EC2
  I want to find out which availability zones are available for me to use
  So I can make my application more tolerant to single-datacenter failures

  Scenario: List availability zones
    When I ask for the list of EC2 availability zones
    Then the result should contain the following zone information:
    | name       | region    |
    | us-east-1a | us-east-1 |

  @memoized
  Scenario: List availability zones with memoization
    Given I start a memoization block
    When I group the availability zones by state
    And I count the availability zones
    Then exactly 1 request should have been made like:
    | TYPE  | NAME   | VALUE                     |
    | param | Action | DescribeAvailabilityZones |
