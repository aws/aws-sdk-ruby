Feature: ELB Availability Zones

  As a user of Elastic Load Balancing
  I want to add and remove availability zones

  @enable
  Scenario: Adding availability Zones
    Given I create a load balancer with the following availability zones:
    | AZ_NAME    |
    | us-east-1a |
    | us-east-1b |
    When I enable the availability zone "us-east-1c" for the load balancer
    Then the load balancer should have the following availability zones:
    | AZ_NAME    |
    | us-east-1a |
    | us-east-1b |
    | us-east-1c |
