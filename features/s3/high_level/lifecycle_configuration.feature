Feature: Bucket Lifecycle Configuration

  Scenario: 
    Given I create a new bucket
    Then the lifecycle configuration should have 0 rules

  Scenario: Adding expiration rule
    Given I create a new bucket
    When I add a rule with the prefix "abc" that expires in 10 days
    And I add a rule with the prefix "xyz" that expires in 5 days
    And I update the lifecycle configuration
    Then 1 request should have been made like:
    | TYPE   | NAME          | VALUE       |
    | http   | verb          | GET         |
    | http   | uri           | /?lifecycle |
    And 1 request should have been made like:
    | TYPE   | NAME          | VALUE       |
    | http   | verb          | PUT         |
    | http   | uri           | /?lifecycle |

  @expiration_date
  Scenario: Adding expiration rule with date time
    Given I create a new bucket
    When I update the lifecycle configuration like:
    """
      @bucket.lifecycle_configuration.update do
        add_rule 'prefix/a', :id => 'id-1',
          :expiration_time => Date.new(2013, 01, 03)
      end
    """
    Then the lifecycle configuration should have the following rules:
    | ID   | PREFIX   | EXP        | STATUS   |
    | id-1 | prefix/a | 2013-01-03 | Enabled  |
    And 1 request should have been made like:
    | TYPE   | NAME          | VALUE       |
    | http   | verb          | PUT         |
    | http   | uri           | /?lifecycle |

  @tiered_storage
  Scenario: Adding Amazon Glacier transition rule
    Given I create a new bucket
    When I update the lifecycle configuration like:
    """
      @bucket.lifecycle_configuration.update do
        add_rule 'prefix/a', :id => 'id-1',
          :glacier_transition_time => Date.new(2013, 01, 03)

    Then the lifecycle configuration should have the following rules:

    | id-1 | prefix/a | 2013-01-03 | Enabled  |
    | id-2 | prefix/b | 15         | Enabled  |
    And 1 request should have been made like:
    | TYPE   | NAME          | VALUE       |
    | http   | verb          | PUT         |
    | http   | uri           | /?lifecycle |

  Scenario: Updating a lifecycle configuration (block style)
    Given I create a new bucket
    When I update the lifecycle configuration like:
    """
      @bucket.lifecycle_configuration.update do
        add_rule 'prefix/a', 4, :id => 'id-1'

  Scenario: Removing a rule
    Given I create a new bucket
    When I update the lifecycle configuration like:
    """
      @bucket.lifecycle_configuration.update do
        add_rule 'prefix/a', 4, :id => 'id-1'

  Scenario: Replacing a lifecycle configuration
