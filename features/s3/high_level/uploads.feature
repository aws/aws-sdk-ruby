Feature: Uploads

  As a user of the S3 high-level interface
  I want to be able to upload data
  so that S3 will store it for me

  @put_object
  Scenario: Large file
    Given the multipart upload threshold is 5mb
    And I have a 7mb file
    When I write the file to the object "foo"
    Then the contents of object "foo" should eventually match the file
    And a request should have been made like:
    | TYPE | NAME | VALUE         |
    | http | verb | POST          |
    | http | uri  | /foo?uploads= |
    And a request should have been made like:
    | TYPE        | NAME           | VALUE   |
    | http        | verb           | PUT     |
    | http        | path           | /foo    |
    | header      | content-length | 5242880 |
    | param       | partNumber     | 1       |
    | param_match | uploadId       | .+      |
    And a request should have been made like:
    | TYPE        | NAME           | VALUE   |
    | http        | verb           | PUT     |
    | http        | path           | /foo    |
    | header      | content-length | 2097152 |
    | param       | partNumber     | 2       |
    | param_match | uploadId       | .+      |
    And a request should have been made like:
    | TYPE        | NAME     | VALUE |
    | http        | verb     | POST  |
    | http        | path     | /foo  |
    | param_match | uploadId | .+    |

  @put_object
  Scenario: Large file with metadata
    Given the multipart upload threshold is 5mb
    And I have a 7mb file
    When I write the file to the object "foo" with the following metadata:
    | color | red    |
    | shape | circle |
    Then the metadata of object "foo" should eventually be:
    | color | red    |
    | shape | circle |
    And a request should have been made like:
    | TYPE   | NAME             | VALUE         |
    | http   | verb             | POST          |
    | http   | uri              | /foo?uploads= |
    | header | x-amz-meta-color | red           |
    | header | x-amz-meta-shape | circle        |

  Scenario: Start a multipart upload
    When I start an upload to object "foo"
    Then the result should be an upload object
    And the list of uploads for the bucket should include the upload
    And a request should have been made like:
    | TYPE | NAME | VALUE         |
    | http | verb | POST          |
    | http | uri  | /foo?uploads= |

  Scenario: Upload a part
    Given I start an upload to object "foo"
    When I add a part to the upload with data "HELLO"
    Then the result should be an uploaded part
    And the parts list should include the part I uploaded
    And a request should have been made like:
    | TYPE        | NAME           | VALUE |
    | http        | verb           | PUT   |

    | header      | content-length | 5     |
    | param       | partNumber     | 1     |
    | param_match | uploadId       | .+    |

  Scenario: Complete an upload with parts uploaded using the object
    Given I start an upload to object "foo"
    And I add a part to the upload with data "HELLO"
    When I complete the upload with the parts uploaded using the object
    Then the contents of object "foo" should eventually be "HELLO"
    And a request should have been made like:
    | TYPE        | NAME     | VALUE |
    | http        | verb     | POST  |

    | param_match | uploadId | .+    |

  Scenario: Complete an upload with all parts in S3
    Given I start an upload to object "foo"
    And I add a part to the upload with data "HELLO"
    And I get the upload again by ID

  Scenario: List uploads for an object

    | param | prefix  | foo   |

  Scenario: Get a multipart upload by ID
    When I ask for the upload to "foo" with ID "abc123"
