    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading static credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleWebIdentityCredentials` - Used when you need to
    #       assume a role after providing credentials via the web.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SSOCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from AWS SSO using an
    #       access token generated from `aws login`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ProcessCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       process that outputs to stdout.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ECSCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from
    #       instances running in ECS.
    #
    #     * `Aws::CognitoIdentityCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from the Cognito Identity service.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2/ECS IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts
    #       are very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of

    #   @option options [Integer] :max_attempts (3)
    #     An integer representing the maximum number attempts that will be made for
    #     a single request, including the initial attempt.  For example,
    #     setting this value to 5 will result in a request being retried up to
    #     4 times. Used in `standard` and `adaptive` retry modes.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :profile ("default")
    #     Used when loading credentials from the shared credentials file

    #
    #   @option options [Proc] :retry_backoff
    #     A proc or lambda used for backoff. Defaults to 2**retries * retry_base_delay.
    #     This option is only used in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :retry_base_delay (0.3)
    #     The base delay in seconds used by the default backoff function. This option

    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_limit (3)
    #     The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #     ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #     are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #     checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors, auth errors,
    #     endpoint discovery, and errors from expired credentials.
    #     This option is only used in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_max_delay (0)
    #     The maximum number of seconds to delay between retries (0 for no limit)
    #     used by the default backoff function. This option is only used in the
    #     `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :retry_mode ("legacy")
    #     Specifies which retry algorithm to use. Values are:
    #

    #       no retry mode is provided.
    #
    #     * `standard` - A standardized set of retry rules across the AWS SDKs.
    #       This includes support for retry quotas, which limit the number of
    #       unsuccessful retries a client can make.
    #
    #     * `adaptive` - An experimental retry mode that includes all the
    #       functionality of `standard` mode along with automatic client side
    #       throttling.  This is a provisional mode that may change behavior
    #       in the future.
    #
    #
    #   @option options [String] :secret_access_key
    #
    #   @option options [String] :session_token
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :simple_json (false)
    #     Disables request parameter conversion, validation, and formatting.
    #     Also disable response data type conversions. This option is useful
    #     when you want to ensure the highest level of performance by
    #     avoiding overhead of walking request parameters and response data
    #     structures.
    #
    #     When `:simple_json` is enabled, the request parameters hash must
    #     be formatted exactly as the DynamoDB API expects.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #     Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #     fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #     the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #     {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #     ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #     requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #     When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #     sending the request.
    #
    #   @option options [URI::HTTP,String] :http_proxy A proxy to send
    #     requests through.  Formatted like 'http://proxy.com:123'.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_open_timeout (15) The number of
    #     seconds to wait when opening a HTTP session before raising a
    #     `Timeout::Error`.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :http_read_timeout (60) The default
    #     number of seconds to wait for response data.  This value can
    #     safely be set per-request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_idle_timeout (5) The number of
    #     seconds a connection is allowed to sit idle before it is
    #     considered stale.  Stale connections are closed and removed
    #     from the pool before making a request.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_continue_timeout (1) The number of
    #     seconds to wait for a 100-continue response before sending the
    #     request body.  This option has no effect unless the request has
    #     "Expect" header set to "100-continue".  Defaults to `nil` which
    #     disables this behaviour.  This value can safely be set per
    #     request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :http_wire_trace (false) When `true`,
    #     HTTP debug output will be sent to the `:logger`.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :ssl_verify_peer (true) When `true`,
    #     SSL peer certificates are verified when establishing a
    #     connection.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_bundle Full path to the SSL
    #     certificate authority bundle file that should be used when
    #     verifying peer certificates.  If you do not pass
    #     `:ssl_ca_bundle` or `:ssl_ca_directory` the the system default
    #     will be used if available.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_directory Full path of the
    #     directory that contains the unbundled SSL certificate
    #     authority files for verifying peer certificates.  If you do
    #     not pass `:ssl_ca_bundle` or `:ssl_ca_directory` the the

    # Disables automatic scheduled rotation and cancels the rotation of a
    # secret if currently in progress.
    #
    # To re-enable scheduled rotation, call RotateSecret with
    # `AutomaticallyRotateAfterDays` set to a value greater than 0. This
    # immediately rotates your secret and then enables the automatic
    # schedule.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> If you cancel a rotation while in progress, it can leave the
    # `VersionStage` labels in an unexpected state. Depending on the step of
    # the rotation in progress, you might need to remove the staging label
    # `AWSPENDING` from the partially created version, specified by the
    # `VersionId` response value. You should also evaluate the partially
    # rotated new version to see if it should be deleted, which you can do
    # by removing all staging labels from the new version `VersionStage`
    # field.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # To successfully start a rotation, the staging label `AWSPENDING` must
    # be in one of the following states:
    #
    # * Not attached to any version at all
    #
    # * Attached to the same version as the staging label `AWSCURRENT`
    #
    # If the staging label `AWSPENDING` attached to a different version than
    # the version with `AWSCURRENT` then the attempt to rotate fails.
    #
    # **Minimum permissions**
    #
    # To run this command, you must have the following permissions:
    #
    # * secretsmanager:CancelRotateSecret
    #
    # ^
    #
    # **Related operations**
    #
    # * To configure rotation for a secret or to manually trigger a
    #   rotation, use RotateSecret.
    #
    # * To get the rotation configuration details for a secret, use
    #   DescribeSecret.
    #
    # * To list all of the currently available secrets, use ListSecrets.
    #
    # * To list all of the versions currently associated with a secret, use
    #   ListSecretVersionIds.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :secret_id
    #   Specifies the secret to cancel a rotation request. You can specify
    #   either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the
    #   secret.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a
    #   complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you
    #   don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets
    #   Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A
    #   partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one
    #   secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen
    #   followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and
    #   six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN,
    #   then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re
    #   specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected
    #   results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create
    #   secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.
    #
    #    If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and
    #   instead provide the 'friendly name', you *must* not include the
    #   random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets
    #   Manager, you receive either a *ResourceNotFoundException* or an
    #   *AccessDeniedException* error, depending on your permissions.

    # the secret.
    #
    # Secrets Manager stores the encrypted secret data in one of a

    # contains a copy of the encrypted secret data. Each version is
    # associated with one or more "staging labels" that identify where the
    # version is in the rotation cycle. The `SecretVersionsToStages` field
    # of the secret contains the mapping of staging labels to the active
    # versions of the secret. Versions without a staging label are
    # considered deprecated and not included in the list.
    #
    # You provide the secret data to be encrypted by putting text in either
    # the `SecretString` parameter or binary data in the `SecretBinary`
    # parameter, but not both. If you include `SecretString` or

    #   (CMK) with the alias `aws/secretsmanager`. If this key doesn't
    #   already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for
    #   you automatically. All users and roles in the same AWS account
    #   automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an
    #   Secrets Manager API call results in AWS creating the account's
    #   AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in

    # * If the secret resides in a different AWS account from the

    #   credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK
    #   in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by
    #   including it in the `KMSKeyId`. If you call an API that must encrypt
    #   or decrypt `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` using credentials from a

    #   secret, use DescribeSecret and examine the `SecretVersionsToStages`
    #   response value.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :name
    #   Specifies the friendly name of the new secret.
    #
    #   The secret name must be ASCII letters, digits, or the following
    #   characters : /\_+=.@-
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Do not end your secret name with a hyphen followed by six characters.
    #   If you do so, you risk confusion and unexpected results when searching
    #   for a secret by partial ARN. Secrets Manager automatically adds a
    #   hyphen and six random characters at the end of the ARN.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    # @option params [String] :client_request_token
    #   (Optional) If you include `SecretString` or `SecretBinary`, then an
    #   initial version is created as part of the secret, and this parameter
    #   specifies a unique identifier for the new version.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDK to call this operation,
    #   then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a
    #   random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this parameter in
    #   the request. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP
    #   request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must
    #   generate a `ClientRequestToken` yourself for the new version and
    #   include the value in the request.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value
    #   to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are
    #   failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate
    #   a [UUID-type][1] value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within
    #   the specified secret.
    #
    #   * If the `ClientRequestToken` value isn't already associated with a
    #     version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.
    #
    #   * If a version with this value already exists and the version
    #     `SecretString` and `SecretBinary` values are the same as those in
    #     the request, then the request is ignored.
    #
    #   * If a version with this value already exists and that version's
    #     `SecretString` and `SecretBinary` values are different from those in
    #     the request then the request fails because you cannot modify an
    #     existing version. Instead, use PutSecretValue to create a new
    #     version.
    #
    #   This value becomes the `VersionId` of the new version.
    #
    #   **A suitable default value is auto-generated.** You should normally
    #   not need to pass this option.**

    #
    # @option params [String] :description
    #   (Optional) Specifies a user-provided description of the secret.
    #
    # @option params [String] :kms_key_id
    #   (Optional) Specifies the ARN, Key ID, or alias of the AWS KMS customer
    #   master key (CMK) to be used to encrypt the `SecretString` or
    #   `SecretBinary` values in the versions stored in this secret.
    #
    #   You can specify any of the supported ways to identify a AWS KMS key
    #   ID. If you need to reference a CMK in a different account, you can use
    #   only the key ARN or the alias ARN.
    #
    #   If you don't specify this value, then Secrets Manager defaults to
    #   using the AWS account's default CMK (the one named
    #   `aws/secretsmanager`). If a AWS KMS CMK with that name doesn't yet
    #   exist, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically the first
    #   time it needs to encrypt a version's `SecretString` or `SecretBinary`
    #   fields.
    #
    #   You can use the account default CMK to encrypt and decrypt only if you
    #   call this operation using credentials from the same account that owns
    #   the secret. If the secret resides in a different account, then you
    #   must create a custom CMK and specify the ARN in this field.
    #
    # @option params [String, StringIO, File] :secret_binary
    #   (Optional) Specifies binary data that you want to encrypt and store in
    #   the new version of the secret. To use this parameter in the
    #   command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary data in a
    #   file and then use the appropriate technique for your tool to pass the
    #   contents of the file as a parameter.
    #
    #   Either `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` must have a value, but not
    #   both. They cannot both be empty.
    #
    #   This parameter is not available using the Secrets Manager console. It
    #   can be accessed only by using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs.
    #
    # @option params [String] :secret_string
    #   (Optional) Specifies text data that you want to encrypt and store in
    #   this new version of the secret.
    #
    #   Either `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` must have a value, but not
    #   both. They cannot both be empty.
    #
    #   If you create a secret by using the Secrets Manager console then
    #   Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the
    #   `SecretString` parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the
    #   information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the Lambda
    #   rotation function knows how to parse.
    #
    #   For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text
    #   string argument and specify key/value pairs. For information on how to
    #   format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool
    #   environments, see [Using JSON for Parameters][1] in the *AWS CLI User
    #   Guide*. For example:
    #
    #   `\{"username":"bob","password":"abc123xyz456"\}`
    #
    #   If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the
    #   parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the
    #   double quotes required in the JSON text.
    #
    #
    #
    #   [1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json
    #
    # @option params [Array<Types::Tag>] :tags
    #   (Optional) Specifies a list of user-defined tags that are attached to
    #   the secret. Each tag is a "Key" and "Value" pair of strings. This
    #   operation only appends tags to the existing list of tags. To remove
    #   tags, you must use UntagResource.
    #
    #   * Secrets Manager tag key names are case sensitive. A tag with the key
    #     "ABC" is a different tag from one with key "abc".
    #
    #   * If you check tags in IAM policy `Condition` elements as part of your
    #     security strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change
    #     permissions. If the successful completion of this operation would
    #     result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then this
    #     operation is blocked and returns an `Access Denied` error.
    #
    #   This parameter requires a JSON text string argument. For information
    #   on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool
    #   environments, see [Using JSON for Parameters][1] in the *AWS CLI User
    #   Guide*. For example:
    #
    #   `[\{"Key":"CostCenter","Value":"12345"\},\{"Key":"environment","Value":"production"\}]`
    #
    #   If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the
    #   parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the
    #   double quotes required in the JSON text.
    #
    #   The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
    #
    #   * Maximum number of tags per secret—50
    #
    #   * Maximum key length—127 Unicode characters in UTF-8
    #
    #   * Maximum value length—255 Unicode characters in UTF-8
    #
    #   * Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
    #
    #   * Do not use the `aws:` prefix in your tag names or values because AWS
    #     reserves it for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag names or
    #     values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against
    #     your tags per secret limit.
    #
    #   * If you use your tagging schema across multiple services and
    #     resources, remember other services might have restrictions on
    #     allowed characters. Generally allowed characters: letters, spaces,
    #     and numbers representable in UTF-8, plus the following special
    #     characters: + - = . \_ : / @.

    # @option params [required, String] :secret_id
    #   The identifier for the secret containing the versions you want to
    #   list. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the
    #   friendly name of the secret.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a
    #   complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you
    #   don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets
    #   Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A
    #   partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one
    #   secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen
    #   followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and
    #   six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN,
    #   then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re
    #   specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected
    #   results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create
    #   secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.
    #
    #    If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and
    #   instead provide the 'friendly name', you *must* not include the
    #   random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets
    #   Manager, you receive either a *ResourceNotFoundException* or an

    # Stores a new encrypted secret value in the specified secret. To do

    #
    # <note markdown="1"> The Secrets Manager console uses only the `SecretString` field. To add
    # binary data to a secret with the `SecretBinary` field you must use the
    # AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # * If this operation creates the first version for the secret then
    #   Secrets Manager automatically attaches the staging label
    #   `AWSCURRENT` to the new version.
    #
    # * If another version of this secret already exists, then this
    #   operation does not automatically move any staging labels other than
    #   those that you explicitly specify in the `VersionStages` parameter.
    #
    # * If this operation moves the staging label `AWSCURRENT` from another
    #   version to this version (because you included it in the
    #   `StagingLabels` parameter) then Secrets Manager also automatically
    #   moves the staging label `AWSPREVIOUS` to the version that
    #   `AWSCURRENT` was removed from.
    #
    # * This operation is idempotent. If a version with a `VersionId` with
    #   the same value as the `ClientRequestToken` parameter already exists
    #   and you specify the same secret data, the operation succeeds but
    #   does nothing. However, if the secret data is different, then the
    #   operation fails because you cannot modify an existing version; you
    #   can only create new ones.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> * If you call an operation to encrypt or decrypt the `SecretString` or
    #   `SecretBinary` for a secret in the same account as the calling user
    #   and that secret doesn't specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets
    #   Manager uses the account's default AWS managed customer master key
    #   (CMK) with the alias `aws/secretsmanager`. If this key doesn't
    #   already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for
    #   you automatically. All users and roles in the same AWS account
    #   automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an
    #   Secrets Manager API call results in AWS creating the account's
    #   AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in
    #   returning the result.
    #
    # * If the secret resides in a different AWS account from the
    #   credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of
    #   the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK
    #   because you can't access the default CMK for the account using
    #   credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK
    #   in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by
    #   including it in the `KMSKeyId`. If you call an API that must encrypt
    #   or decrypt `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` using credentials from a
    #   different account then the AWS KMS key policy must grant
    #   cross-account access to that other account's user or role for both
    #   the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations.

    #
    # @option params [required, String] :secret_id
    #   Specifies the secret to which you want to add a new version. You can
    #   specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of
    #   the secret. The secret must already exist.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a
    #   complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you
    #   don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets
    #   Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A
    #   partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one
    #   secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen
    #   followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and
    #   six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN,
    #   then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re
    #   specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected
    #   results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create
    #   secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.
    #
    #    If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and
    #   instead provide the 'friendly name', you *must* not include the
    #   random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets
    #   Manager, you receive either a *ResourceNotFoundException* or an
    #   *AccessDeniedException* error, depending on your permissions.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    # @option params [String] :client_request_token
    #   (Optional) Specifies a unique identifier for the new version of the
    #   secret.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDK to call this operation,
    #   then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a
    #   random UUID for you and includes that in the request. If you don't
    #   use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets
    #   Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a
    #   `ClientRequestToken` yourself for new versions and include that value
    #   in the request.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value
    #   to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are
    #   failures and retries during the Lambda rotation function's
    #   processing. We recommend that you generate a [UUID-type][1] value to
    #   ensure uniqueness within the specified secret.
    #
    #   * If the `ClientRequestToken` value isn't already associated with a
    #     version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.
    #
    #   * If a version with this value already exists and that version's
    #     `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` values are the same as those in the
    #     request then the request is ignored (the operation is idempotent).
    #
    #   * If a version with this value already exists and the version of the
    #     `SecretString` and `SecretBinary` values are different from those in
    #     the request then the request fails because you cannot modify an
    #     existing secret version. You can only create new versions to store
    #     new secret values.
    #
    #   This value becomes the `VersionId` of the new version.
    #
    #   **A suitable default value is auto-generated.** You should normally
    #   not need to pass this option.**

    #

    #   [1]: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier
    #
    # @option params [String, StringIO, File] :secret_binary
    #   (Optional) Specifies binary data that you want to encrypt and store in
    #   the new version of the secret. To use this parameter in the
    #   command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary data in a
    #   file and then use the appropriate technique for your tool to pass the
    #   contents of the file as a parameter. Either `SecretBinary` or
    #   `SecretString` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be
    #   empty.
    #
    #   This parameter is not accessible if the secret using the Secrets
    #   Manager console.
    #
    # @option params [String] :secret_string
    #   (Optional) Specifies text data that you want to encrypt and store in
    #   this new version of the secret. Either `SecretString` or
    #   `SecretBinary` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be
    #   empty.
    #
    #   If you create this secret by using the Secrets Manager console then
    #   Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the
    #   `SecretString` parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the
    #   information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the default
    #   Lambda rotation function knows how to parse.
    #
    #   For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text
    #   string argument and specify key/value pairs. For information on how to
    #   format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool
    #   environments, see [Using JSON for Parameters][1] in the *AWS CLI User
    #   Guide*.
    #
    #   For example:
    #
    #   `[\{"username":"bob"\},\{"password":"abc123xyz456"\}]`
    #
    #   If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the
    #   parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the
    #   double quotes required in the JSON text.

    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :version_stages
    #   (Optional) Specifies a list of staging labels that are attached to
    #   this version of the secret. These staging labels are used to track the
    #   versions through the rotation process by the Lambda rotation function.
    #
    #   A staging label must be unique to a single version of the secret. If
    #   you specify a staging label that's already associated with a
    #   different version of the same secret then that staging label is
    #   automatically removed from the other version and attached to this
    #   version.
    #
    #   If you do not specify a value for `VersionStages` then Secrets Manager
    #   automatically moves the staging label `AWSCURRENT` to this new
    #   version.

    # @return [Types::PutSecretValueResponse] Returns a {Seahorse::Client::Response response} object which responds to the following methods:

    # Configures and starts the asynchronous process of rotating this

    # sets those values for the secret and then immediately starts a

    # operation starts a rotation with the values already stored in the
    # secret. After the rotation completes, the protected service and its
    # clients all use the new version of the secret.
    #
    # This required configuration information includes the ARN of an AWS
    # Lambda function and the time between scheduled rotations. The Lambda
    # rotation function creates a new version of the secret and creates or
    # updates the credentials on the protected service to match. After
    # testing the new credentials, the function marks the new secret with
    # the staging label `AWSCURRENT` so that your clients all immediately
    # begin to use the new version. For more information about rotating
    # secrets and how to configure a Lambda function to rotate the secrets
    # for your protected service, see [Rotating Secrets in AWS Secrets
    # Manager][1] in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide*.
    #
    # Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation when the previous one
    # completes. Secrets Manager schedules the date by adding the rotation
    # interval (number of days) to the actual date of the last rotation. The
    # service chooses the hour within that 24-hour date window randomly. The
    # minute is also chosen somewhat randomly, but weighted towards the top
    # of the hour and influenced by a variety of factors that help
    # distribute load.
    #
    # The rotation function must end with the versions of the secret in one
    # of two states:

    #   secret.
    #
    # If the `AWSPENDING` staging label is present but not attached to the

    #   The identifier for the secret that you want to remove tags from. You

    #   of the secret.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a
    #   complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you
    #   don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets
    #   Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A
    #   partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one
    #   secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen
    #   followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and
    #   six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN,
    #   then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re
    #   specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected
    #   results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create
    #   secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.
    #
    #    If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and
    #   instead provide the 'friendly name', you *must* not include the
    #   random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets

    #
    # To modify the rotation configuration of a secret, use RotateSecret
    # instead.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> The Secrets Manager console uses only the `SecretString` parameter and
    # therefore limits you to encrypting and storing only a text string. To
    # encrypt and store binary data as part of the version of a secret, you

    #
    # * If you include `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` to create a new
    #   secret version, Secrets Manager automatically attaches the staging
    #   label `AWSCURRENT` to the new version.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> * If you call an operation to encrypt or decrypt the `SecretString` or
    #   `SecretBinary` for a secret in the same account as the calling user
    #   and that secret doesn't specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets
    #   Manager uses the account's default AWS managed customer master key
    #   (CMK) with the alias `aws/secretsmanager`. If this key doesn't
    #   already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for
    #   you automatically. All users and roles in the same AWS account
    #   automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an
    #   Secrets Manager API call results in AWS creating the account's
    #   AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in
    #   returning the result.
    #
    # * If the secret resides in a different AWS account from the
    #   credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of
    #   the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK
    #   because you can't access the default CMK for the account using
    #   credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK
    #   in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by
    #   including it in the `KMSKeyId`. If you call an API that must encrypt
    #   or decrypt `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` using credentials from a
    #   different account then the AWS KMS key policy must grant
    #   cross-account access to that other account's user or role for both

    #   Specifies the secret that you want to modify or to which you want to

    #

    #
    # @option params [String] :client_request_token
    #   (Optional) If you want to add a new version to the secret, this
    #   parameter specifies a unique identifier for the new version that helps
    #   ensure idempotency.
    #
    #   If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDK to call this operation,
    #   then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a
    #   random UUID for you and includes that in the request. If you don't
    #   use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets
    #   Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a
    #   `ClientRequestToken` yourself for new versions and include that value
    #   in the request.
    #
    #   You typically only need to interact with this value if you implement
    #   your own retry logic and want to ensure that a given secret is not
    #   created twice. We recommend that you generate a [UUID-type][1] value
    #   to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret.
    #
    #   Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of
    #   duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during the Lambda
    #   rotation function's processing.
    #
    #   * If the `ClientRequestToken` value isn't already associated with a
    #     version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.
    #
    #   * If a version with this value already exists and that version's
    #     `SecretString` and `SecretBinary` values are the same as those in
    #     the request then the request is ignored (the operation is
    #     idempotent).
    #
    #   * If a version with this value already exists and that version's
    #     `SecretString` and `SecretBinary` values are different from the
    #     request then an error occurs because you cannot modify an existing
    #     secret value.
    #
    #   This value becomes the `VersionId` of the new version.
    #
    #   **A suitable default value is auto-generated.** You should normally
    #   not need to pass this option.**

    #
    # @option params [String] :description
    #   (Optional) Specifies an updated user-provided description of the
    #   secret.
    #
    # @option params [String] :kms_key_id
    #   (Optional) Specifies an updated ARN or alias of the AWS KMS customer
    #   master key (CMK) to be used to encrypt the protected text in new
    #   versions of this secret.
    #
    #   You can only use the account's default CMK to encrypt and decrypt if
    #   you call this operation using credentials from the same account that
    #   owns the secret. If the secret is in a different account, then you
    #   must create a custom CMK and provide the ARN of that CMK in this
    #   field. The user making the call must have permissions to both the
    #   secret and the CMK in their respective accounts.
    #
    # @option params [String, StringIO, File] :secret_binary
    #   (Optional) Specifies updated binary data that you want to encrypt and
    #   store in the new version of the secret. To use this parameter in the
    #   command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary data in a
    #   file and then use the appropriate technique for your tool to pass the
    #   contents of the file as a parameter. Either `SecretBinary` or
    #   `SecretString` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be
    #   empty.
    #
    #   This parameter is not accessible using the Secrets Manager console.
    #
    # @option params [String] :secret_string
    #   (Optional) Specifies updated text data that you want to encrypt and
    #   store in this new version of the secret. Either `SecretBinary` or
    #   `SecretString` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be
    #   empty.
    #
    #   If you create this secret by using the Secrets Manager console then
    #   Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the
    #   `SecretString` parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the
    #   information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the default
    #   Lambda rotation function knows how to parse.
    #
    #   For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text
    #   string argument and specify key/value pairs. For information on how to
    #   format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool
    #   environments, see [Using JSON for Parameters][1] in the *AWS CLI User
    #   Guide*. For example:
    #
    #   `[\{"username":"bob"\},\{"password":"abc123xyz456"\}]`
    #
    #   If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the
    #   parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the
    #   double quotes required in the JSON text. You can also 'escape' the
    #   double quote character in the embedded JSON text by prefacing each
    #   with a backslash. For example, the following string is surrounded by
    #   double-quotes. All of the embedded double quotes are escaped:
    #
    #   `"[\{"username":"bob"\},\{"password":"abc123xyz456"\}]"`

    #
    # @option params [String] :secret_id
    #   The identifier for the secret that you want to validate a resource
    #   policy. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the
    #   friendly name of the secret.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a
    #   complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you
    #   don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets
    #   Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A
    #   partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one
    #   secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen
    #   followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and
    #   six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN,
    #   then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re
    #   specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected
    #   results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create
    #   secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.
    #
    #    If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and
    #   instead provide the 'friendly name', you *must* not include the
    #   random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets
    #   Manager, you receive either a *ResourceNotFoundException* or an
    #   *AccessDeniedException* error, depending on your permissions.
