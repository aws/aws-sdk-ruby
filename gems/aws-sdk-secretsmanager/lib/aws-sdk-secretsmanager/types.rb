    #   The name of the new secret.
    #
    #   The secret name can contain ASCII letters, numbers, and the
    #   following characters: /\_+=.@-
    #
    #   Do not end your secret name with a hyphen followed by six
    #   characters. If you do so, you risk confusion and unexpected results
    #   when searching for a secret by partial ARN. Secrets Manager
    #   automatically adds a hyphen and six random characters after the
    #   secret name at the end of the ARN.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] client_request_token
    #   If you include `SecretString` or `SecretBinary`, then Secrets
    #   Manager creates an initial version for the secret, and this
    #   parameter specifies the unique identifier for the new version.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web
    #   Services SDKs to call this operation, then you can leave this
    #   parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and
    #   includes it as the value for this parameter in the request. If you
    #   don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the
    #   Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a
    #   `ClientRequestToken` yourself for the new version and include the
    #   value in the request.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value
    #   to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there
    #   are failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you
    #   generate a [UUID-type][1] value to ensure uniqueness of your
    #   versions within the specified secret.
    #
    #   * If the `ClientRequestToken` value isn't already associated with a
    #     version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.
    #
    #   * If a version with this value already exists and the version
    #     `SecretString` and `SecretBinary` values are the same as those in
    #     the request, then the request is ignored.
    #
    #   * If a version with this value already exists and that version's
    #     `SecretString` and `SecretBinary` values are different from those
    #     in the request, then the request fails because you cannot modify
    #     an existing version. Instead, use PutSecretValue to create a new
    #     version.
    #
    #   This value becomes the `VersionId` of the new version.
    #
    #   **A suitable default value is auto-generated.** You should normally
    #   not need to pass this option.

    # @!attribute [rw] description
    #   The description of the secret.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] kms_key_id
    #   The ARN, key ID, or alias of the KMS key that Secrets Manager uses
    #   to encrypt the secret value in the secret.
    #
    #   To use a KMS key in a different account, use the key ARN or the
    #   alias ARN.
    #
    #   If you don't specify this value, then Secrets Manager uses the key
    #   `aws/secretsmanager`. If that key doesn't yet exist, then Secrets
    #   Manager creates it for you automatically the first time it encrypts
    #   the secret value.
    #
    #   If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account from the
    #   credentials calling the API, then you can't use
    #   `aws/secretsmanager` to encrypt the secret, and you must create and
    #   use a customer managed KMS key.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] secret_binary
    #   The binary data to encrypt and store in the new version of the
    #   secret. We recommend that you store your binary data in a file and
    #   then pass the contents of the file as a parameter.
    #
    #   Either `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` must have a value, but not
    #   both.
    #
    #   This parameter is not available in the Secrets Manager console.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] secret_string
    #   The text data to encrypt and store in this new version of the
    #   secret. We recommend you use a JSON structure of key/value pairs for
    #   your secret value.
    #
    #   Either `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` must have a value, but not
    #   both.
    #
    #   If you create a secret by using the Secrets Manager console then
    #   Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the
    #   `SecretString` parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the
    #   information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that a Lambda
    #   rotation function can parse.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] tags
    #   A list of tags to attach to the secret. Each tag is a key and value
    #   pair of strings in a JSON text string, for example:
    #
    #   `[\{"Key":"CostCenter","Value":"12345"\},\{"Key":"environment","Value":"production"\}]`
    #
    #   Secrets Manager tag key names are case sensitive. A tag with the key
    #   "ABC" is a different tag from one with key "abc".
    #
    #   If you check tags in permissions policies as part of your security
    #   strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If
    #   the completion of this operation would result in you losing your
    #   permissions for this secret, then Secrets Manager blocks the
    #   operation and returns an `Access Denied` error. For more
    #   information, see [Control access to secrets using tags][1] and
    #   [Limit access to identities with tags that match secrets' tags][2].
    #
    #   For information about how to format a JSON parameter for the various
    #   command line tool environments, see [Using JSON for Parameters][3].
    #   If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the
    #   parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the
    #   double quotes required in the JSON text.
    #
    #   The following restrictions apply to tags:
    #
    #   * Maximum number of tags per secret: 50
    #
    #   * Maximum key length: 127 Unicode characters in UTF-8
    #
    #   * Maximum value length: 255 Unicode characters in UTF-8
    #
    #   * Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
    #
    #   * Do not use the `aws:` prefix in your tag names or values because
    #     Amazon Web Services reserves it for Amazon Web Services use. You
    #     can't edit or delete tag names or values with this prefix. Tags
    #     with this prefix do not count against your tags per secret limit.
    #
    #   * If you use your tagging schema across multiple services and
    #     resources, other services might have restrictions on allowed
    #     characters. Generally allowed characters: letters, spaces, and
    #     numbers representable in UTF-8, plus the following special
    #     characters: + - = . \_ : / @.

    #   deprecated and Secrets Manager can delete them.
    #
    #   Secrets Manager uses staging labels to indicate the status of a
    #   secret version during rotation. The three staging labels for
    #   rotation are:
    #
    #   * `AWSCURRENT`, which indicates the current version of the secret.
    #
    #   * `AWSPENDING`, which indicates the version of the secret that
    #     contains new secret information that will become the next current
    #     version when rotation finishes.
    #
    #     During rotation, Secrets Manager creates an `AWSPENDING` version
    #     ID before creating the new secret version. To check if a secret

    #   The number of days between automatic scheduled rotations of the
    #   secret. You can use this value to check that your secret meets your
    #   compliance guidelines for how often secrets must be rotated.
    #
    #   In `DescribeSecret` and `ListSecrets`, this value is calculated from
    #   the rotation schedule after every successful rotation. In
    #   `RotateSecret`, you can set the rotation schedule in `RotationRules`
    #   with `AutomaticallyAfterDays` or `ScheduleExpression`, but not both.

    #   during this window. The window must not go into the next UTC day. If
    #   you don't specify this value, the window automatically ends at the
    #   end of the UTC day. The window begins according to the
    #   `ScheduleExpression`. For more information, including examples, see
    #   [Schedule expressions in Secrets Manager rotation][1].

    #   time zone.
    #
    #   Secrets Manager `rate()` expressions represent the interval in days
    #   that you want to rotate your secret, for example `rate(10 days)`. If
    #   you use a `rate()` expression, the rotation window opens at
    #   midnight, and Secrets Manager rotates your secret any time that day
    #   after midnight. You can set a `Duration` to shorten the rotation
    #   window.
    #
    #   You can use a `cron()` expression to create rotation schedules that
    #   are more detailed than a rotation interval. For more information,
    #   including examples, see [Schedule expressions in Secrets Manager
    #   rotation][1]. If you use a `cron()` expression, Secrets Manager
    #   rotates your secret any time during that day after the window opens.
    #   For example, `cron(0 8 1 * ? *)` represents a rotation window that
    #   occurs on the first day of every month beginning at 8:00 AM UTC.
    #   Secrets Manager rotates the secret any time that day after 8:00 AM.
    #   You can set a `Duration` to shorten the rotation window.
