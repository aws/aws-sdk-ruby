    #   Specifies the secret for which you want to cancel a rotation

    #   the friendly name of the secret.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a
    #   complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you
    #   don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that
    #   Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the
    #   secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches
    #   only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a
    #   hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the
    #   hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a
    #   partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume
    #   that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause
    #   unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you
    #   don’t create secret names that end with a hyphen followed by six
    #   characters.

    # @!attribute [rw] client_request_token
    #   (Optional) If you include `SecretString` or `SecretBinary`, then an
    #   initial version is created as part of the secret, and this parameter
    #   specifies a unique identifier for the new version.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDK to call this operation,
    #   then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a
    #   random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this parameter
    #   in the request. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw
    #   HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must
    #   generate a `ClientRequestToken` yourself for the new version and
    #   include that value in the request.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value
    #   to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there
    #   are failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you
    #   generate a [UUID-type][1] value to ensure uniqueness of your
    #   versions within the specified secret.
    #
    #   * If the `ClientRequestToken` value isn't already associated with a
    #     version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.
    #
    #   * If a version with this value already exists and that version's
    #     `SecretString` and `SecretBinary` values are the same as those in
    #     the request, then the request is ignored (the operation is
    #     idempotent).
    #
    #   * If a version with this value already exists and that version's
    #     `SecretString` and `SecretBinary` values are different from those
    #     in the request then the request fails because you cannot modify an
    #     existing version. Instead, use PutSecretValue to create a new
    #     version.
    #
    #   This value becomes the `VersionId` of the new version.
    #
    #   **A suitable default value is auto-generated.** You should normally
    #   not need to pass this option.

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] description
    #   (Optional) Specifies a user-provided description of the secret.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] kms_key_id
    #   (Optional) Specifies the ARN, Key ID, or alias of the AWS KMS
    #   customer master key (CMK) to be used to encrypt the `SecretString`
    #   or `SecretBinary` values in the versions stored in this secret.
    #
    #   You can specify any of the supported ways to identify a AWS KMS key
    #   ID. If you need to reference a CMK in a different account, you can
    #   use only the key ARN or the alias ARN.
    #
    #   If you don't specify this value, then Secrets Manager defaults to
    #   using the AWS account's default CMK (the one named
    #   `aws/secretsmanager`). If a AWS KMS CMK with that name doesn't yet
    #   exist, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically the
    #   first time it needs to encrypt a version's `SecretString` or
    #   `SecretBinary` fields.
    #
    #   You can use the account's default CMK to encrypt and decrypt only
    #   if you call this operation using credentials from the same account
    #   that owns the secret. If the secret is in a different account, then
    #   you must create a custom CMK and specify the ARN in this field.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] secret_binary
    #   (Optional) Specifies binary data that you want to encrypt and store
    #   in the new version of the secret. To use this parameter in the
    #   command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary data in
    #   a file and then use the appropriate technique for your tool to pass
    #   the contents of the file as a parameter.
    #
    #   Either `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` must have a value, but not
    #   both. They cannot both be empty.
    #
    #   This parameter is not available using the Secrets Manager console.
    #   It can be accessed only by using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] secret_string
    #   (Optional) Specifies text data that you want to encrypt and store in
    #   this new version of the secret.
    #
    #   Either `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` must have a value, but not
    #   both. They cannot both be empty.
    #
    #   If you create a secret by using the Secrets Manager console then
    #   Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the
    #   `SecretString` parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the
    #   information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the Lambda
    #   rotation function knows how to parse.
    #
    #   For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text
    #   string argument and specify key/value pairs. For information on how
    #   to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool
    #   environments, see [Using JSON for Parameters][1] in the *AWS CLI
    #   User Guide*. For example:
    #
    #   `[\{"username":"bob"\},\{"password":"abc123xyz456"\}]`
    #
    #   If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the
    #   parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the
    #   double quotes required in the JSON text.
    #
    #
    #
    #   [1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] tags
    #   (Optional) Specifies a list of user-defined tags that are attached
    #   to the secret. Each tag is a "Key" and "Value" pair of strings.
    #   This operation only appends tags to the existing list of tags. To
    #   remove tags, you must use UntagResource.
    #
    #   * Secrets Manager tag key names are case sensitive. A tag with the
    #     key "ABC" is a different tag from one with key "abc".
    #
    #   * If you check tags in IAM policy `Condition` elements as part of
    #     your security strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change
    #     permissions. If the successful completion of this operation would
    #     result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then this
    #     operation is blocked and returns an `Access Denied` error.
    #
    #   This parameter requires a JSON text string argument. For information
    #   on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool
    #   environments, see [Using JSON for Parameters][1] in the *AWS CLI
    #   User Guide*. For example:
    #
    #   `[\{"Key":"CostCenter","Value":"12345"\},\{"Key":"environment","Value":"production"\}]`
    #
    #   If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the
    #   parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the
    #   double quotes required in the JSON text.
    #
    #   The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
    #
    #   * Maximum number of tags per secret—50
    #
    #   * Maximum key length—127 Unicode characters in UTF-8
    #
    #   * Maximum value length—255 Unicode characters in UTF-8
    #
    #   * Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
    #
    #   * Do not use the `aws:` prefix in your tag names or values because
    #     it is reserved for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag names or
    #     values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count
    #     against your tags per secret limit.
    #
    #   * If your tagging schema will be used across multiple services and
    #     resources, remember that other services might have restrictions on
    #     allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
    #     spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8, plus the following
    #     special characters: + - = . \_ : / @.

    #   (Optional) Specifies binary data that you want to encrypt and store

    #
    #   If you create this secret by using the Secrets Manager console then

    #
    #   For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text

    #   helps ensure idempotency.
    #
    #   If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDK to call this operation,
    #   then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a
    #   random UUID for you and includes that in the request. If you don't
    #   use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets
    #   Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a
    #   `ClientRequestToken` yourself for new versions and include that
    #   value in the request.
    #
    #   You typically only need to interact with this value if you implement
    #   your own retry logic and want to ensure that a given secret is not
    #   created twice. We recommend that you generate a [UUID-type][1] value
    #   to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret.
    #
    #   Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation
    #   of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during the
    #   Lambda rotation function's processing.
    #
    #   * If the `ClientRequestToken` value isn't already associated with a
    #     version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.
    #
    #   * If a version with this value already exists and that version's
    #     `SecretString` and `SecretBinary` values are the same as those in
    #     the request then the request is ignored (the operation is
    #     idempotent).
    #
    #   * If a version with this value already exists and that version's
    #     `SecretString` and `SecretBinary` values are different from the
    #     request then an error occurs because you cannot modify an existing
    #     secret value.

    #
    #   You can only use the account's default CMK to encrypt and decrypt
    #   if you call this operation using credentials from the same account
    #   that owns the secret. If the secret is in a different account, then
    #   you must create a custom CMK and provide the ARN of that CMK in this

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] secret_binary
    #   (Optional) Specifies updated binary data that you want to encrypt
    #   and store in the new version of the secret. To use this parameter in
    #   the command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary data
    #   in a file and then use the appropriate technique for your tool to
    #   pass the contents of the file as a parameter. Either `SecretBinary`
    #   or `SecretString` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both
    #   be empty.

    #   This parameter is not accessible using the Secrets Manager console.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] secret_string

    #   `SecretString` must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be
    #   empty.
    #
    #   If you create this secret by using the Secrets Manager console then
    #   Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the
    #   `SecretString` parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the
    #   information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the default
    #   Lambda rotation function knows how to parse.
    #
    #   For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text
    #   string argument and specify key/value pairs. For information on how
    #   to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool
    #   environments, see [Using JSON for Parameters][1] in the *AWS CLI
    #   User Guide*. For example:
    #
    #   `[\{"username":"bob"\},\{"password":"abc123xyz456"\}]`
    #
    #   If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the
    #   parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the
    #   double quotes required in the JSON text. You can also 'escape' the
    #   double quote character in the embedded JSON text by prefacing each
    #   with a backslash. For example, the following string is surrounded by
    #   double-quotes. All of the embedded double quotes are escaped:
    #
    #   `"[\{"username":"bob"\},\{"password":"abc123xyz456"\}]"`

    #   <note markdown="1"> If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a
    #   complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you
    #   don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that
    #   Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the
    #   secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches
    #   only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a
    #   hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the
    #   hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a
    #   partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume
    #   that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause
    #   unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you
    #   don’t create secret names that end with a hyphen followed by six
    #   characters.
