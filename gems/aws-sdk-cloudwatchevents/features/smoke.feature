Background:
  Given I create a client in region 'us-west-2'

  Scenario: Call Aws::CloudWatchEvents::Client#list_rules and expect it to succeed
  When I call the operation 'list_rules' with params:
    """
{}
    """
  Then I expect an error was not raised

  @cloudwatchevents @smoke
  Scenario: Call Aws::Aws::CloudWatchEvents::Client#describe_rule and expect it to fail
  When I call the operation 'describe_rule' with params:
