    # @overload initialize(options)
    #   @param [Hash] options
    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2 IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts are
    #       very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #       `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` to enable retries and extended
    #       timeouts.
    #
    #   @option options [required, String] :region
    #     The AWS region to connect to.  The configured `:region` is

    #     Also disable response data type conversions. This option is useful
    #     when you want to ensure the highest level of performance by
    #     avoiding overhead of walking request parameters and response data
    #     structures.
    #
    #     When `:simple_json` is enabled, the request parameters hash must
    #     be formatted exactly as the DynamoDB API expects.

    # For another account to send events to your account, that external
    # account must have an EventBridge rule with your account's event bus

    #
    #   If you specify "*" without specifying `Condition`, avoid creating

    # Creates or updates the specified rule. Rules are enabled by default,

    # DisableRule.
    #
    # A single rule watches for events from a single event bus. Events
    # generated by AWS services go to your account's default event bus.
    # Events generated by SaaS partner services or applications go to the
    # matching partner event bus. If you have custom applications or
    # services, you can specify whether their events go to your default
    # event bus or a custom event bus that you have created. For more
    # information, see CreateEventBus.
    #
    # If you are updating an existing rule, the rule is replaced with what
    # you specify in this `PutRule` command. If you omit arguments in
    # `PutRule`, the old values for those arguments are not kept. Instead,
    # they are replaced with null values.
    #
    # When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not
    # immediately start matching to new or updated rules. Allow a short
    # period of time for changes to take effect.
    #
    # A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression.
    # Rules with EventPatterns are triggered when a matching event is
    # observed. Rules with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the
    # given schedule. A rule can have both an EventPattern and a
    # ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule triggers on matching events
    # as well as on a schedule.
    #
    # When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or
    # more tags to the rule. Tags can help you organize and categorize your
    # resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by
    # granting a user permission to access or change only rules with certain
    # tag values. To use the `PutRule` operation and assign tags, you must
    # have both the `events:PutRule` and `events:TagResource` permissions.
    #
    # If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the
    # `PutRule` operation are ignored. To update the tags of an existing
    # rule, use TagResource and UntagResource.
    #
    # Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon
    # Resource Names (ARNs). However, EventBridge uses an exact match in
    # event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters
    # when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the
    # event you want to match.
    #
    # In EventBridge, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite
    # loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might
    # detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to
    # change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written
    # carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again,
    # creating an infinite loop.
    #
    # To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not
    # re-fire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs
    # are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change.
    #
    # An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We
    # recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed
    # your specified limit. For more information, see [Managing Your Costs
    # with Budgets][1].

    # Adds the specified targets to the specified rule, or updates the
    # targets if they are already associated with the rule.
    #
    # Targets are the resources that are invoked when a rule is triggered.
    #
    # You can configure the following as targets for Events:
    #
    # * EC2 instances
    #
    # * SSM Run Command
    #
    # * SSM Automation
    #
    # * AWS Lambda functions
    #
    # * Data streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
    #
    # * Data delivery streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
    #
    # * Amazon ECS tasks
    #
    # * AWS Step Functions state machines
    #
    # * AWS Batch jobs
    #
    # * AWS CodeBuild projects
    #
    # * Pipelines in AWS CodePipeline
    #
    # * Amazon Inspector assessment templates
    #
    # * Amazon SNS topics
    #
    # * Amazon SQS queues, including FIFO queues
    #
    # * The default event bus of another AWS account
    #
    # Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the AWS
    # Management Console. The built-in targets are `EC2 CreateSnapshot API
    # call`, `EC2 RebootInstances API call`, `EC2 StopInstances API call`,
    # and `EC2 TerminateInstances API call`.
    #
    # For some target types, `PutTargets` provides target-specific
    # parameters. If the target is a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally
    # specify which shard the event goes to by using the `KinesisParameters`
    # argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule,
    # you can use the `RunCommandParameters` field.
    #
    # To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own,
    # Amazon CloudWatch Events needs the appropriate permissions. For AWS
    # Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based
    # policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis data streams, and AWS Step
    # Functions state machines, EventBridge relies on IAM roles that you
    # specify in the `RoleARN` argument in `PutTargets`. For more
    # information, see [Authentication and Access Control][1] in the *Amazon
    # EventBridge User Guide*.
    #
    # If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you
    # permission (using `PutPermission`), you can send events to that
    # account. Set that account's event bus as a target of the rules in
    # your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify
    # that account's event bus as the `Arn` value when you run
    # `PutTargets`. If your account sends events to another account, your
    # account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another
    # account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event
    # is not charged. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch
    # Pricing][2].
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> `Input`, `InputPath`, and `InputTransformer` are not available with
    # `PutTarget` if the target is an event bus of a different AWS account.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and
    # that account granted permission to your account through an
    # organization instead of directly by the account ID, then you must
    # specify a `RoleArn` with proper permissions in the `Target` structure.
    # For more information, see [Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS
    # Accounts][3] in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide*.
    #
    # For more information about enabling cross-account events, see
    # PutPermission.
    #
    # **Input**, **InputPath**, and **InputTransformer** are mutually
    # exclusive and optional parameters of a target. When a rule is
    # triggered due to a matched event:
