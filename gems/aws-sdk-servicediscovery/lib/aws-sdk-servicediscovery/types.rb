    #   The routing policy that you want to apply to all records that Route
    #   53 creates when you register an instance and specify this service.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you want to use this service to register instances that create
    #   alias records, specify `WEIGHTED` for the routing policy.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   You can specify the following values:
    #
    #   **MULTIVALUE**
    #
    #   If you define a health check for the service and the health check is
    #   healthy, Route 53 returns the applicable value for up to eight
    #   instances.
    #
    #   For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A
    #   record and a health check, and you use the service to register 10
    #   instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with IP addresses for up
    #   to eight healthy instances. If fewer than eight instances are
    #   healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query with the IP addresses
    #   for all of the healthy instances.
    #
    #   If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53
    #   assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the values for up
    #   to eight instances.
    #
    #   For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see
    #   [Multivalue Answer Routing][1] in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   **WEIGHTED**
    #
    #   Route 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected
    #   instance from among the instances that you registered using the same
    #   service. Currently, all records have the same weight, so you can't
    #   route more or less traffic to any instances.
    #
    #   For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A
    #   record and a health check, and you use the service to register 10
    #   instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the IP address for
    #   one randomly selected instance from among the healthy instances. If
    #   no instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries as if all
    #   of the instances were healthy.
    #
    #   If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53
    #   assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the applicable
    #   value for one randomly selected instance.
    #
    #   For more information about the weighted routing policy, see
    #   [Weighted Routing][2] in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] type
    #   The type of the resource, which indicates the type of value that
    #   Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries.
    #
    #   Note the following:
    #
    #   * **A, AAAA, and SRV records: You can specify settings for a maximum
    #     of one A, one AAAA, and one SRV record. You can specify them in
    #     any combination.**
    #
    #   * **CNAME records:** If you specify `CNAME` for `Type`, you can't
    #     define any other records. This is a limitation of DNS—you can't
    #     create a CNAME record and any other type of record that has the
    #     same name as a CNAME record.
    #
    #   * **Alias records:** If you want Route 53 to create an alias record
    #     when you register an instance, specify `A` or `AAAA` for `Type`.
    #
    #   * **All records:** You specify settings other than `TTL` and `Type`
    #     when you register an instance.
    #
    #   The following values are supported:
    #
    #   **A**
    #
    #   Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such
    #   as 192.0.2.44.
    #
    #   **AAAA**
    #
    #   Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such
    #   as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.
    #
    #   **CNAME**
    #
    #   Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as
    #   www.example.com. Note the following:
    #
    #   * You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when
    #     you register an instance. For more information, see
    #     RegisterInstanceRequest$Attributes.
    #
    #   * You must specify `WEIGHTED` for the value of `RoutingPolicy`.
    #
    #   * You can't specify both `CNAME` for `Type` and settings for
    #     `HealthCheckConfig`. If you do, the request will fail with an
    #     `InvalidInput` error.
    #
    #   **SRV**
    #
    #   Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record. The value for an SRV
    #   record uses the following values:
    #
    #   `priority weight port service-hostname`
    #
    #   Note the following about the values:
    #
    #   * The values of `priority` and `weight` are both set to `1` and
    #     can't be changed.
    #
    #   * The value of `port` comes from the value that you specify for the
    #     `AWS_INSTANCE_PORT` attribute when you submit a RegisterInstance
    #     request.
    #
    #   * The value of `service-hostname` is a concatenation of the
    #     following values:
    #
    #     * The value that you specify for `InstanceId` when you register an
    #       instance.
    #
    #     * The name of the service.
    #
    #     * The name of the namespace.
    #
    #     For example, if the value of `InstanceId` is `test`, the name of
    #     the service is `backend`, and the name of the namespace is
    #     `example.com`, the value of `service-hostname` is:
    #
    #     `test.backend.example.com`
    #
    #   If you specify settings for an SRV record and if you specify values
    #   for `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`, `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`, or both in the
    #   `RegisterInstance` request, Route 53 automatically creates `A`
    #   and/or `AAAA` records that have the same name as the value of
    #   `service-hostname` in the SRV record. You can ignore these records.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] ttl
    #   The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache
    #   the settings for this record.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Alias records don't include a TTL because Route 53 uses the TTL for
    #   the AWS resource that an alias record routes traffic to. If you
    #   include the `AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME` attribute when you submit a
    #   RegisterInstance request, the `TTL` value is ignored. Always specify
    #   a TTL for the service; you can use a service to register instances
    #   that create either alias or non-alias records.

    # *Public DNS namespaces only.* A complex type that contains settings
    # for an optional health check. If you specify settings for a health
    # check, Amazon Route 53 associates the health check with all the
    # records that you specify in `DnsConfig`.
    #
    # **A and AAAA records**
    #
    # If `DnsConfig` includes configurations for both A and AAAA records,
    # Route 53 creates a health check that uses the IPv4 address to check
    # the health of the resource. If the endpoint that is specified by the
    # IPv4 address is unhealthy, Route 53 considers both the A and AAAA
    # records to be unhealthy.
    #
    # **CNAME records**
    #
    # You can't specify settings for `HealthCheckConfig` when the
    # `DNSConfig` includes `CNAME` for the value of `Type`. If you do, the
    # `CreateService` request will fail with an `InvalidInput` error.
    #
    # **Request interval**
    #
    # The health check uses 30 seconds as the request interval. This is the
    # number of seconds between the time that each Route 53 health checker
    # gets a response from your endpoint and the time that it sends the next
    # health check request. A health checker in each data center around the
    # world sends your endpoint a health check request every 30 seconds. On
    # average, your endpoint receives a health check request about every two
    # seconds. Health checkers in different data centers don't coordinate
    # with one another, so you'll sometimes see several requests per second
    # followed by a few seconds with no health checks at all.
    #
    # **Health checking regions**
    #
    # Health checkers perform checks from all Route 53 health-checking
    # regions. For a list of the current regions, see [Regions][1].
    #
    # **Alias records**
    #
    # When you register an instance, if you include the `AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`
    # attribute, Route 53 creates an alias record. Note the following:
    #
    # * Route 53 automatically sets `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for alias
    #   records. When `EvaluateTargetHealth` is true, the alias record
    #   inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource. such as an ELB
    #   load balancer. For more information, see [EvaluateTargetHealth][2].
    #
    # * If you include `HealthCheckConfig` and then use the service to
    #   register an instance that creates an alias record, Route 53 doesn't
    #   create the health check.
    #
    # For information about the charges for health checks, see [Route 53
    # Pricing][3].

    # @!attribute [rw] type
    #   The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates

    #
    #   You can't change the value of `Type` after you create a health
    #   check.
    #
    #   You can create the following types of health checks:
    #
    #   * **HTTP**\: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If
    #     successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP
    #     status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.
    #
    #   * **HTTPS**\: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If
    #     successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an
    #     HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.
    #
    #     If you specify HTTPS for the value of `Type`, the endpoint must
    #     support TLS v1.0 or later.
    #
    #   * **TCP**\: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

    #
    #   * You can use this value to update an existing instance.
    #

    #
    #   ****
    #
    #   If you want Route 53 to create an alias record that routes traffic

    #   that is associated with the load balancer. For information about how
    #   to get the DNS name, see "DNSName" in the topic [AliasTarget][1].
    #
    #   Note the following:
    #
    #   * The configuration for the service that is specified by `ServiceId`
    #     must include settings for an A record, an AAAA record, or both.
    #
    #   * In the service that is specified by `ServiceId`, the value of
    #     `RoutingPolicy` must be `WEIGHTED`.
    #
    #   * If the service that is specified by `ServiceId` includes
    #     `HealthCheckConfig` settings, Route 53 will create the health
    #     check, but it won't associate the health check with the alias
    #     record.
    #
    #   * Auto naming currently doesn't support creating alias records that
    #     route traffic to AWS resources other than ELB load balancers.
    #
    #   * If you specify a value for `AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`, don't specify
    #     values for any of the `AWS_INSTANCE` attributes.

    #
    #   Supported attribute keys include the following:
    #
    #   **AWS\_ALIAS\_DNS\_NAME**
    #
    #   ****
    #
    #   If you want Route 53 to create an alias record that routes traffic
    #   to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, specify the DNS name
    #   that is associated with the load balancer. For information about how
    #   to get the DNS name, see "DNSName" in the topic [AliasTarget][1].
    #
    #   Note the following:
    #
    #   * The configuration for the service that is specified by `ServiceId`
    #     must include settings for an A record, an AAAA record, or both.
    #
    #   * In the service that is specified by `ServiceId`, the value of
    #     `RoutingPolicy` must be `WEIGHTED`.
    #
    #   * If the service that is specified by `ServiceId` includes
    #     `HealthCheckConfig` settings, Route 53 will create the health
    #     check, but it won't associate the health check with the alias
    #     record.
    #
    #   * Auto naming currently doesn't support creating alias records that
    #     route traffic to AWS resources other than ELB load balancers.
    #
    #   * If you specify a value for `AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`, don't specify
    #     values for any of the `AWS_INSTANCE` attributes.
    #
    #   **AWS\_INSTANCE\_CNAME**
    #
    #   If the service configuration includes a CNAME record, the domain
    #   name that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries,
    #   for example, `example.com`.
    #
    #   This value is required if the service specified by `ServiceId`
    #   includes settings for an CNAME record.
    #
    #   **AWS\_INSTANCE\_IPV4**
    #
    #   If the service configuration includes an A record, the IPv4 address
    #   that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for
    #   example, `192.0.2.44`.
    #
    #   This value is required if the service specified by `ServiceId`
    #   includes settings for an A record. If the service includes settings
    #   for an SRV record, you must specify a value for `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`,
    #   `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`, or both.
    #
    #   **AWS\_INSTANCE\_IPV6**
    #
    #   If the service configuration includes an AAAA record, the IPv6
    #   address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries,
    #   for example, `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`.
    #
    #   This value is required if the service specified by `ServiceId`
    #   includes settings for an AAAA record. If the service includes
    #   settings for an SRV record, you must specify a value for
    #   `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`, `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`, or both.
    #
    #   **AWS\_INSTANCE\_PORT**
    #
    #   If the service includes an SRV record, the value that you want Route
    #   53 to return for the port.
    #
    #   If the service includes `HealthCheckConfig`, the port on the
    #   endpoint that you want Route 53 to send requests to.
    #

    #   check, Amazon Route 53 associates the health check with all the
    #   records that you specify in `DnsConfig`.
    #
    #   **A and AAAA records**
    #
    #   If `DnsConfig` includes configurations for both A and AAAA records,
    #   Route 53 creates a health check that uses the IPv4 address to check
    #   the health of the resource. If the endpoint that is specified by the
    #   IPv4 address is unhealthy, Route 53 considers both the A and AAAA
    #   records to be unhealthy.
    #
    #   **CNAME records**
    #
    #   You can't specify settings for `HealthCheckConfig` when the
    #   `DNSConfig` includes `CNAME` for the value of `Type`. If you do, the
    #   `CreateService` request will fail with an `InvalidInput` error.
    #
    #   **Request interval**
    #
    #   The health check uses 30 seconds as the request interval. This is
    #   the number of seconds between the time that each Route 53 health
    #   checker gets a response from your endpoint and the time that it
    #   sends the next health check request. A health checker in each data
    #   center around the world sends your endpoint a health check request
    #   every 30 seconds. On average, your endpoint receives a health check
    #   request about every two seconds. Health checkers in different data
    #   centers don't coordinate with one another, so you'll sometimes see
    #   several requests per second followed by a few seconds with no health
    #   checks at all.
    #
    #   **Health checking regions**
    #
    #   Health checkers perform checks from all Route 53 health-checking
    #   regions. For a list of the current regions, see [Regions][1].
    #
    #   **Alias records**
    #
    #   When you register an instance, if you include the
    #   `AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME` attribute, Route 53 creates an alias record.
    #   Note the following:
    #
    #   * Route 53 automatically sets `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for
    #     alias records. When `EvaluateTargetHealth` is true, the alias
    #     record inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource. such as
    #     an ELB load balancer. For more information, see
    #     [EvaluateTargetHealth][2].
    #
    #   * If you include `HealthCheckConfig` and then use the service to
    #     register an instance that creates an alias record, Route 53
    #     doesn't create the health check.
    #
