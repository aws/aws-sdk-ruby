    #   The routing policy that you want to apply to all RouteÂ 53 DNS
    #   records that AWS Cloud Map creates when you register an instance and
    #   specify this service.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you want to use this service to register instances that create
    #   alias records, specify `WEIGHTED` for the routing policy.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   You can specify the following values:
    #
    #   **MULTIVALUE**
    #
    #   If you define a health check for the service and the health check is
    #   healthy, RouteÂ 53 returns the applicable value for up to eight
    #   instances.
    #
    #   For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one `A`
    #   record and a health check, and you use the service to register 10
    #   instances. RouteÂ 53 responds to DNS queries with IP addresses for up
    #   to eight healthy instances. If fewer than eight instances are
    #   healthy, RouteÂ 53 responds to every DNS query with the IP addresses
    #   for all of the healthy instances.
    #
    #   If you don't define a health check for the service, RouteÂ 53
    #   assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the values for up
    #   to eight instances.
    #
    #   For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see
    #   [Multivalue Answer Routing][1] in the *RouteÂ 53 Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   **WEIGHTED**
    #
    #   RouteÂ 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected
    #   instance from among the instances that you registered using the same
    #   service. Currently, all records have the same weight, so you can't
    #   route more or less traffic to any instances.
    #
    #   For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one `A`
    #   record and a health check, and you use the service to register 10
    #   instances. RouteÂ 53 responds to DNS queries with the IP address for
    #   one randomly selected instance from among the healthy instances. If
    #   no instances are healthy, RouteÂ 53 responds to DNS queries as if all
    #   of the instances were healthy.
    #
    #   If you don't define a health check for the service, RouteÂ 53
    #   assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the applicable
    #   value for one randomly selected instance.

    # address to check the health of the resource. If the endpoint that is
    # specified by the IPv4 address is unhealthy, RouteÂ 53 considers both
    # the `A` and `AAAA` records to be unhealthy.
    #
    # <b> <code>CNAME</code> records</b>
    #
    # You can't specify settings for `HealthCheckConfig` when the
    # `DNSConfig` includes `CNAME` for the value of `Type`. If you do, the
    # `CreateService` request will fail with an `InvalidInput` error.
    #
    # **Request interval**
    #
    # A RouteÂ 53 health checker in each health-checking region sends a
    # health check request to an endpoint every 30 seconds. On average, your
    # endpoint receives a health check request about every two seconds.
    # However, health checkers don't coordinate with one another, so
    # you'll sometimes see several requests per second followed by a few
    # seconds with no health checks at all.
    #
    # **Health checking regions**
    #
    # Health checkers perform checks from all RouteÂ 53 health-checking
    # regions. For a list of the current regions, see [Regions][2].
    #
    # **Alias records**
    #
    # When you register an instance, if you include the `AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`
    # attribute, AWS Cloud Map creates a RouteÂ 53 alias record. Note the
    # following:
    #
    # * RouteÂ 53 automatically sets `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for alias
    #   records. When `EvaluateTargetHealth` is true, the alias record
    #   inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource. such as an ELB
    #   load balancer. For more information, see [EvaluateTargetHealth][3].
    #
    # * If you include `HealthCheckConfig` and then use the service to
    #   register an instance that creates an alias record, RouteÂ 53 doesn't
    #   create the health check.
    #
    # **Charges for health checks**
    #
    # Health checks are basic RouteÂ 53 health checks that monitor an AWS
    # endpoint. For information about pricing for health checks, see [Amazon
    # RouteÂ 53 Pricing][1].

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] type
    #   The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates
    #   how RouteÂ 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.
    #
    #   You can't change the value of `Type` after you create a health
    #   check.
    #
    #   You can create the following types of health checks:
    #
    #   * **HTTP**\: RouteÂ 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If
    #     successful, RouteÂ 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP
    #     status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.
    #
    #   * **HTTPS**\: RouteÂ 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If
    #     successful, RouteÂ 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an
    #     HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.
    #
    #     If you specify HTTPS for the value of `Type`, the endpoint must
    #     support TLS v1.0 or later.
    #
    #   * **TCP**\: RouteÂ 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.
    #
    #     If you specify `TCP` for `Type`, don't specify a value for
    #     `ResourcePath`.

    # A complex type that contains information about an optional custom
    # health check. A custom health check, which requires that you use a
    # third-party health checker to evaluate the health of your resources,
    # is useful in the following circumstances:
    #
    # * You can't use a health check that is defined by `HealthCheckConfig`
    #   because the resource isn't available over the internet. For
    #   example, you can use a custom health check when the instance is in
    #   an Amazon VPC. (To check the health of resources in a VPC, the
    #   health checker must also be in the VPC.)
    #
    # * You want to use a third-party health checker regardless of where
    #   your resources are.
    #
    # If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either
    # `HealthCheckCustomConfig` or `HealthCheckConfig` but not both.
    #
    # To change the status of a custom health check, submit an
    # `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request. AWS Cloud Map doesn't
    # monitor the status of the resource, it just keeps a record of the
    # status specified in the most recent `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`
    # request.
    #
    # Here's how custom health checks work:
    #
    # 1.  You create a service and specify a value for `FailureThreshold`.
    #
    #     The failure threshold indicates the number of 30-second intervals
    #     you want AWS Cloud Map to wait between the time that your
    #     application sends an [UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus][1] request
    #     and the time that AWS Cloud Map stops routing internet traffic to
    #     the corresponding resource.
    #
    # 2.  You register an instance.
    #
    # 3.  You configure a third-party health checker to monitor the resource
    #     that is associated with the new instance.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> AWS Cloud Map doesn't check the health of the resource directly.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    # 4.  The third-party health-checker determines that the resource is
    #     unhealthy and notifies your application.
    #
    # 5.  Your application submits an `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`
    #     request.
    #
    # 6.  AWS Cloud Map waits for (`FailureThreshold` x 30) seconds.
    #
    # 7.  If another `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request doesn't
    #     arrive during that time to change the status back to healthy, AWS
    #     Cloud Map stops routing traffic to the resource.

    #     must include settings for an `A` record, an `AAAA` record, or
    #     both.
    #
    #   * In the service that is specified by `ServiceId`, the value of

    #     check, but it won't associate the health check with the alias
    #     record.
    #
    #   * Auto naming currently doesn't support creating alias records that
    #     route traffic to AWS resources other than ELB load balancers.

    #
    #   * You can use this value to update an existing instance.
    #
    #   * To register a new instance, you must specify a value that is
    #     unique among instances that you register by using the same
    #     service.
    #
    #   * If you specify an existing `InstanceId` and `ServiceId`, AWS Cloud

    #   * The attributes that apply to the records that are defined in the
    #     service.
    #
    #   * For each attribute, the applicable value.
    #
    #   Supported attribute keys include the following:
    #
    #   **AWS\_ALIAS\_DNS\_NAME**
    #
    #   If you want AWS Cloud Map to create an Amazon RouteÂ 53 alias record
    #   that routes traffic to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer,
    #   specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. For
    #   information about how to get the DNS name, see "DNSName" in the
    #   topic [AliasTarget][1] in the *RouteÂ 53 API Reference*.
    #
    #   Note the following:
    #
    #   * The configuration for the service that is specified by `ServiceId`
    #     must include settings for an `A` record, an `AAAA` record, or
    #     both.
    #
    #   * In the service that is specified by `ServiceId`, the value of
    #     `RoutingPolicy` must be `WEIGHTED`.
    #
    #   * If the service that is specified by `ServiceId` includes
    #     `HealthCheckConfig` settings, AWS Cloud Map will create the
    #     RouteÂ 53 health check, but it won't associate the health check
    #     with the alias record.
    #
    #   * Auto naming currently doesn't support creating alias records that
    #     route traffic to AWS resources other than Elastic Load Balancing
    #     load balancers.
    #
    #   * If you specify a value for `AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`, don't specify
    #     values for any of the `AWS_INSTANCE` attributes.
    #
    #   **AWS\_EC2\_INSTANCE\_ID**
    #
    #   *HTTP namespaces only.* The Amazon EC2 instance ID for the instance.
    #   If the `AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID` attribute is specified, then the only
    #   other attribute that can be specified is `AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS`.
    #   When the `AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID` attribute is specified, then the
    #   `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4` attribute will be filled out with the primary
    #   private IPv4 address.
    #
    #   **AWS\_INIT\_HEALTH\_STATUS**
    #
    #   If the service configuration includes `HealthCheckCustomConfig`, you
    #   can optionally use `AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS` to specify the initial
    #   status of the custom health check, `HEALTHY` or `UNHEALTHY`. If you
    #   don't specify a value for `AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS`, the initial
    #   status is `HEALTHY`.
    #
    #   **AWS\_INSTANCE\_CNAME**
    #
    #   If the service configuration includes a `CNAME` record, the domain
    #   name that you want RouteÂ 53 to return in response to DNS queries,
    #   for example, `example.com`.
    #
    #   This value is required if the service specified by `ServiceId`
    #   includes settings for an `CNAME` record.
    #
    #   **AWS\_INSTANCE\_IPV4**
    #
    #   If the service configuration includes an `A` record, the IPv4
    #   address that you want RouteÂ 53 to return in response to DNS queries,
    #   for example, `192.0.2.44`.
    #
    #   This value is required if the service specified by `ServiceId`
    #   includes settings for an `A` record. If the service includes
    #   settings for an `SRV` record, you must specify a value for
    #   `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`, `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`, or both.
    #
    #   **AWS\_INSTANCE\_IPV6**
    #
    #   If the service configuration includes an `AAAA` record, the IPv6
    #   address that you want RouteÂ 53 to return in response to DNS queries,
    #   for example, `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`.
    #
    #   This value is required if the service specified by `ServiceId`
    #   includes settings for an `AAAA` record. If the service includes
    #   settings for an `SRV` record, you must specify a value for
    #   `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`, `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`, or both.
    #
    #   **AWS\_INSTANCE\_PORT**
    #
    #   If the service includes an `SRV` record, the value that you want
    #   RouteÂ 53 to return for the port.
    #
    #   If the service includes `HealthCheckConfig`, the port on the
    #   endpoint that you want RouteÂ 53 to send requests to.
    #
    #   This value is required if you specified settings for an `SRV` record
    #   or a RouteÂ 53 health check when you created the service.
    #
    #   **Custom attributes**
    #
    #   You can add up to 30 custom attributes. For each key-value pair, the
    #   maximum length of the attribute name is 255 characters, and the
    #   maximum length of the attribute value is 1,024 characters. The total

    #   *Public DNS and HTTP namespaces only.* A complex type that contains
    #   settings for an optional health check. If you specify settings for a
    #   health check, AWS Cloud Map associates the health check with the
    #   records that you specify in `DnsConfig`.
    #
    #   If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either
    #   `HealthCheckCustomConfig` or `HealthCheckConfig` but not both.
    #
    #   Health checks are basic RouteÂ 53 health checks that monitor an AWS
    #   endpoint. For information about pricing for health checks, see
    #   [Amazon RouteÂ 53 Pricing][1].
    #
    #   Note the following about configuring health checks.
    #
    #   <b> <code>A</code> and <code>AAAA</code> records</b>
    #
    #   If `DnsConfig` includes configurations for both `A` and `AAAA`
    #   records, AWS Cloud Map creates a health check that uses the IPv4
    #   address to check the health of the resource. If the endpoint that is
    #   specified by the IPv4 address is unhealthy, RouteÂ 53 considers both
    #   the `A` and `AAAA` records to be unhealthy.
    #
    #   <b> <code>CNAME</code> records</b>
    #
    #   You can't specify settings for `HealthCheckConfig` when the
    #   `DNSConfig` includes `CNAME` for the value of `Type`. If you do, the
    #   `CreateService` request will fail with an `InvalidInput` error.
    #
    #   **Request interval**
    #
    #   A RouteÂ 53 health checker in each health-checking region sends a
    #   health check request to an endpoint every 30 seconds. On average,
    #   your endpoint receives a health check request about every two
    #   seconds. However, health checkers don't coordinate with one
    #   another, so you'll sometimes see several requests per second
    #   followed by a few seconds with no health checks at all.
    #
    #   **Health checking regions**
    #
    #   Health checkers perform checks from all RouteÂ 53 health-checking
    #   regions. For a list of the current regions, see [Regions][2].
    #
    #   **Alias records**
    #
    #   When you register an instance, if you include the
    #   `AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME` attribute, AWS Cloud Map creates a RouteÂ 53
    #   alias record. Note the following:
    #
    #   * RouteÂ 53 automatically sets `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for
    #     alias records. When `EvaluateTargetHealth` is true, the alias
    #     record inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource. such as
    #     an ELB load balancer. For more information, see
    #     [EvaluateTargetHealth][3].
    #
    #   * If you include `HealthCheckConfig` and then use the service to
    #     register an instance that creates an alias record, RouteÂ 53
    #     doesn't create the health check.

    # @!attribute [rw] health_check_custom_config
    #   A complex type that contains information about an optional custom
    #   health check. A custom health check, which requires that you use a
    #   third-party health checker to evaluate the health of your resources,
    #   is useful in the following circumstances:
    #
    #   * You can't use a health check that is defined by
    #     `HealthCheckConfig` because the resource isn't available over the
    #     internet. For example, you can use a custom health check when the
    #     instance is in an Amazon VPC. (To check the health of resources in
    #     a VPC, the health checker must also be in the VPC.)
    #
    #   * You want to use a third-party health checker regardless of where
    #     your resources are.
    #
    #   If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either
    #   `HealthCheckCustomConfig` or `HealthCheckConfig` but not both.
    #
    #   To change the status of a custom health check, submit an
    #   `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request. AWS Cloud Map doesn't
    #   monitor the status of the resource, it just keeps a record of the
    #   status specified in the most recent
    #   `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request.
    #
    #   Here's how custom health checks work:
    #
    #   1.  You create a service and specify a value for `FailureThreshold`.
    #
    #       The failure threshold indicates the number of 30-second
    #       intervals you want AWS Cloud Map to wait between the time that
    #       your application sends an [UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus][1]
    #       request and the time that AWS Cloud Map stops routing internet
    #       traffic to the corresponding resource.
    #
    #   2.  You register an instance.
    #
    #   3.  You configure a third-party health checker to monitor the
    #       resource that is associated with the new instance.
    #
    #       <note markdown="1"> AWS Cloud Map doesn't check the health of the resource
    #       directly.
    #
    #        </note>
    #
    #   4.  The third-party health-checker determines that the resource is
    #       unhealthy and notifies your application.
    #
    #   5.  Your application submits an `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`
    #       request.
    #
    #   6.  AWS Cloud Map waits for (`FailureThreshold` x 30) seconds.
    #
    #   7.  If another `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request doesn't
    #       arrive during that time to change the status back to healthy,
    #       AWS Cloud Map stops routing traffic to the resource.
