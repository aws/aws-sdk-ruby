    #   If you want Cloud Map to create an `SRV` record when you register an
    #   instance and you're using a system that requires a specific `SRV`
    #   format, such as [HAProxy][1], specify the following for `Name`\:
    #
    #   * Start the name with an underscore (\_), such as `_exampleservice`.
    #
    #   * End the name with *.\_protocol*, such as `._tcp`.
    #
    #   When you register an instance, Cloud Map creates an `SRV` record and
    #   assigns a name to the record by concatenating the service name and
    #   the namespace name (for example,
    #
    #   `_exampleservice._tcp.example.com`).
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> For services that are accessible by DNS queries, you can't create
    #   multiple services with names that differ only by case (such as
    #   EXAMPLE and example). Otherwise, these services have the same DNS
    #   name and can't be distinguished. However, if you use a namespace
    #   that's only accessible by API calls, then you can create services
    #   that with names that differ only by case.

    #     For example, suppose that the service includes configurations for
    #     one `A` record and a health check. You use the service to register
    #     10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with IP addresses
    #     for up to eight healthy instances. If fewer than eight instances
    #     are healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query with the IP
    #     addresses for all of the healthy instances.
    #
    #     If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53
    #     assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the values for
    #     up to eight instances.
    #
    #     For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see
    #     [Multivalue Answer Routing][1] in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   WEIGHTED
    #
    #   : Route 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected
    #     instance from among the instances that you registered using the
    #     same service. Currently, all records have the same weight, so you
    #     can't route more or less traffic to any instances.

    #     For example, suppose that the service includes configurations for

    #     10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the IP address
    #     for one randomly selected instance from among the healthy

    #   The type of the resource, which indicates the type of value that

    #

    #
    #   * <b> <code>CNAME</code> </b>
    #
    #   If you want Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias record when you
    #   register an instance, specify `A` or `AAAA` for `Type`.
    #
    #   You specify other settings, such as the IP address for `A` and
    #   `AAAA` records, when you register an instance. For more information,
    #   see [RegisterInstance][1].
    #
    #   The following values are supported:
    #
    #   A
    #
    #   : Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format,
    #     such as 192.0.2.44.
    #
    #   AAAA
    #
    #   : Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format,
    #     such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.
    #
    #   CNAME
    #
    #   : Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as
    #     www.example.com. Note the following:
    #
    #     * You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to
    #       when you register an instance. For more information, see
    #       [Attributes][2] in the topic [RegisterInstance][1].
    #
    #     * You must specify `WEIGHTED` for the value of `RoutingPolicy`.
    #
    #     * You can't specify both `CNAME` for `Type` and settings for
    #       `HealthCheckConfig`. If you do, the request will fail with an
    #       `InvalidInput` error.
    #
    #   SRV
    #
    #   : Route 53 returns the value for an `SRV` record. The value for an
    #     `SRV` record uses the following values:
    #
    #     `priority weight port service-hostname`
    #
    #     Note the following about the values:
    #
    #     * The values of `priority` and `weight` are both set to `1` and
    #       can't be changed.
    #
    #     * The value of `port` comes from the value that you specify for
    #       the `AWS_INSTANCE_PORT` attribute when you submit a
    #       [RegisterInstance][1] request.
    #
    #     * The value of `service-hostname` is a concatenation of the
    #       following values:
    #
    #       * The value that you specify for `InstanceId` when you register
    #         an instance.
    #
    #       * The name of the service.
    #
    #       * The name of the namespace.
    #
    #       For example, if the value of `InstanceId` is `test`, the name of
    #       the service is `backend`, and the name of the namespace is
    #       `example.com`, the value of `service-hostname` is the following:
    #
    #       `test.backend.example.com`
    #
    #     If you specify settings for an `SRV` record, note the following:
    #
    #     * If you specify values for `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`,
    #       `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`, or both in the `RegisterInstance` request,
    #       Cloud Map automatically creates `A` and/or `AAAA` records that
    #       have the same name as the value of `service-hostname` in the
    #       `SRV` record. You can ignore these records.
    #
    #     * If you're using a system that requires a specific `SRV` format,
    #       such as HAProxy, see the [Name][3] element in the documentation
    #       about `CreateService` for information about how to specify the
    #       correct name format.

    # *Public DNS and HTTP namespaces only.* A complex type that contains
    # settings for an optional health check. If you specify settings for a
    # health check, Cloud Map associates the health check with the records
    # that you specify in `DnsConfig`.
    #
    # If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either
    # `HealthCheckCustomConfig` or `HealthCheckConfig` but not both.
    #
    # Health checks are basic Route 53 health checks that monitor an Amazon
    # Web Services endpoint. For information about pricing for health
    # checks, see [Amazon Route 53 Pricing][1].
    #
    # Note the following about configuring health checks.
    #
    # A and AAAA records
    #
    # : If `DnsConfig` includes configurations for both `A` and `AAAA`
    #   records, Cloud Map creates a health check that uses the IPv4 address
    #   to check the health of the resource. If the endpoint tthat's
    #   specified by the IPv4 address is unhealthy, Route 53 considers both
    #   the `A` and `AAAA` records to be unhealthy.
    #
    # CNAME records
    #
    # : You can't specify settings for `HealthCheckConfig` when the
    #   `DNSConfig` includes `CNAME` for the value of `Type`. If you do, the
    #   `CreateService` request will fail with an `InvalidInput` error.
    #
    # Request interval
    #
    # : A Route 53 health checker in each health-checking Amazon Web
    #   Services Region sends a health check request to an endpoint every 30
    #   seconds. On average, your endpoint receives a health check request
    #   about every two seconds. However, health checkers don't coordinate
    #   with one another. Therefore, you might sometimes see several
    #   requests in one second that's followed by a few seconds with no
    #   health checks at all.
    #
    # Health checking regions
    #
    # : Health checkers perform checks from all Route 53 health-checking
    #   Regions. For a list of the current Regions, see [Regions][2].
    #
    # Alias records
    #
    # : When you register an instance, if you include the
    #   `AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME` attribute, Cloud Map creates a Route 53 alias
    #   record. Note the following:
    #
    #   * Route 53 automatically sets `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for
    #     alias records. When `EvaluateTargetHealth` is true, the alias
    #     record inherits the health of the referenced Amazon Web Services
    #     resource. such as an ELB load balancer. For more information, see
    #     [EvaluateTargetHealth][3].
    #
    #   * If you include `HealthCheckConfig` and then use the service to
    #     register an instance that creates an alias record, Route 53
    #     doesn't create the health check.
    #

    #
    #   You can't change the value of `Type` after you create a health
    #   check.
    #
    #   You can create the following types of health checks:
    #
    #   * **HTTP**\: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If
    #     successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP
    #     status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.
    #
    #   * **HTTPS**\: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If
    #     successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an
    #     HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.
    #
    #     If you specify HTTPS for the value of `Type`, the endpoint must
    #     support TLS v1.0 or later.
    #
    #   * **TCP**\: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.
    #
    #     If you specify `TCP` for `Type`, don't specify a value for
    #     `ResourcePath`.

    # A complex type that contains information about an optional custom
    # health check. A custom health check, which requires that you use a
    # third-party health checker to evaluate the health of your resources,
    # is useful in the following circumstances:
    #
    # * You can't use a health check that's defined by `HealthCheckConfig`
    #   because the resource isn't available over the internet. For
    #   example, you can use a custom health check when the instance is in
    #   an Amazon VPC. (To check the health of resources in a VPC, the
    #   health checker must also be in the VPC.)
    #
    # * You want to use a third-party health checker regardless of where
    #   your resources are located.
    #
    # If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either
    # `HealthCheckCustomConfig` or `HealthCheckConfig` but not both.
    #
    # To change the status of a custom health check, submit an
    # `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request. Cloud Map doesn't monitor
    # the status of the resource, it just keeps a record of the status
    # specified in the most recent `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`
    # request.
    #
    # Here's how custom health checks work:
    #
    # 1.  You create a service.
    #
    # 2.  You register an instance.
    #
    # 3.  You configure a third-party health checker to monitor the resource
    #     that's associated with the new instance.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Cloud Map doesn't check the health of the resource directly.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    # 4.  The third-party health-checker determines that the resource is
    #     unhealthy and notifies your application.
    #
    # 5.  Your application submits an `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`
    #     request.
    #
    # 6.  Cloud Map waits for 30 seconds.
    #
    # 7.  If another `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request doesn't
    #     arrive during that time to change the status back to healthy,
    #     Cloud Map stops routing traffic to the resource.

    # @note When making an API call, you may pass HealthCheckCustomConfig

    #   A string map that contains the following information:
    #
    #   * The attributes that are associated with the instance.
    #
    #   * For each attribute, the applicable value.
    #
    #   Supported attribute keys include the following:
    #
    #   AWS\_ALIAS\_DNS\_NAME
    #
    #   : For an alias record that routes traffic to an Elastic Load
    #     Balancing load balancer, the DNS name that's associated with the
    #     load balancer.
    #
    #   AWS\_EC2\_INSTANCE\_ID (HTTP namespaces only)
    #
    #   : The Amazon EC2 instance ID for the instance. When the
    #     `AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID` attribute is specified, then the
    #     `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4` attribute contains the primary private IPv4
    #     address.
    #
    #   AWS\_INIT\_HEALTH\_STATUS
    #
    #   : If the service configuration includes `HealthCheckCustomConfig`,
    #     you can optionally use `AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS` to specify the
    #     initial status of the custom health check, `HEALTHY` or
    #     `UNHEALTHY`. If you don't specify a value for
    #     `AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS`, the initial status is `HEALTHY`.
    #
    #   AWS\_INSTANCE\_CNAME
    #
    #   : For a `CNAME` record, the domain name that Route 53 returns in
    #     response to DNS queries (for example, `example.com`).
    #
    #   AWS\_INSTANCE\_IPV4
    #
    #   : For an `A` record, the IPv4 address that Route 53 returns in
    #     response to DNS queries (for example, `192.0.2.44`).
    #
    #   AWS\_INSTANCE\_IPV6
    #
    #   : For an `AAAA` record, the IPv6 address that Route 53 returns in
    #     response to DNS queries (for example,
    #     `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`).
    #
    #   AWS\_INSTANCE\_PORT
    #
    #   : For an `SRV` record, the value that Route 53 returns for the port.
    #     In addition, if the service includes `HealthCheckConfig`, the port
    #     on the endpoint that Route 53 sends requests to.

    #     information, see [DnsRecord &gt; Type][1].
    #
    #   * You can use this value to update an existing instance.
    #
    #   * To register a new instance, you must specify a value that's
    #     unique among instances that you register by using the same
    #     service.
    #
    #   * If you specify an existing `InstanceId` and `ServiceId`, Cloud Map

    #     existing health check, Cloud Map deletes the old health check and
    #     creates a new one.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> The health check isn't deleted immediately, so it will still

    #
    #   * For each attribute, the applicable value.
    #
    #   Supported attribute keys include the following:
    #
    #   AWS\_ALIAS\_DNS\_NAME
    #
    #   : If you want Cloud Map to create an Amazon Route 53 alias record
    #     that routes traffic to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer,
    #     specify the DNS name that's associated with the load balancer.
    #     For information about how to get the DNS name, see "DNSName" in
    #     the topic [AliasTarget][1] in the *Route 53 API Reference*.
    #
    #     Note the following:
    #
    #     * The configuration for the service that's specified by
    #       `ServiceId` must include settings for an `A` record, an `AAAA`
    #       record, or both.
    #
    #     * In the service that's specified by `ServiceId`, the value of
    #       `RoutingPolicy` must be `WEIGHTED`.
    #
    #     * If the service that's specified by `ServiceId` includes
    #       `HealthCheckConfig` settings, Cloud Map will create the Route 53
    #       health check, but it doesn't associate the health check with
    #       the alias record.
    #
    #     * Auto naming currently doesn't support creating alias records
    #       that route traffic to Amazon Web Services resources other than
    #       Elastic Load Balancing load balancers.
    #
    #     * If you specify a value for `AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`, don't specify
    #       values for any of the `AWS_INSTANCE` attributes.
    #
    #   AWS\_EC2\_INSTANCE\_ID
    #
    #   : *HTTP namespaces only.* The Amazon EC2 instance ID for the
    #     instance. If the `AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID` attribute is specified,
    #     then the only other attribute that can be specified is
    #     `AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS`. When the `AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID` attribute
    #     is specified, then the `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4` attribute will be
    #     filled out with the primary private IPv4 address.
    #
    #   AWS\_INIT\_HEALTH\_STATUS
    #
    #   : If the service configuration includes `HealthCheckCustomConfig`,
    #     you can optionally use `AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS` to specify the
    #     initial status of the custom health check, `HEALTHY` or
    #     `UNHEALTHY`. If you don't specify a value for
    #     `AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS`, the initial status is `HEALTHY`.
    #
    #   AWS\_INSTANCE\_CNAME
    #
    #   : If the service configuration includes a `CNAME` record, the domain
    #     name that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries
    #     (for example, `example.com`).
    #
    #     This value is required if the service specified by `ServiceId`
    #     includes settings for an `CNAME` record.
    #
    #   AWS\_INSTANCE\_IPV4
    #
    #   : If the service configuration includes an `A` record, the IPv4
    #     address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS
    #     queries (for example, `192.0.2.44`).
    #
    #     This value is required if the service specified by `ServiceId`
    #     includes settings for an `A` record. If the service includes
    #     settings for an `SRV` record, you must specify a value for
    #     `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`, `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`, or both.
    #
    #   AWS\_INSTANCE\_IPV6
    #
    #   : If the service configuration includes an `AAAA` record, the IPv6
    #     address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS
    #     queries (for example, `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`).
    #
    #     This value is required if the service specified by `ServiceId`
    #     includes settings for an `AAAA` record. If the service includes
    #     settings for an `SRV` record, you must specify a value for
    #     `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4`, `AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6`, or both.
    #
    #   AWS\_INSTANCE\_PORT
    #
    #   : If the service includes an `SRV` record, the value that you want
    #     Route 53 to return for the port.
    #
    #     If the service includes `HealthCheckConfig`, the port on the
    #     endpoint that you want Route 53 to send requests to.
    #
    #     This value is required if you specified settings for an `SRV`
    #     record or a Route 53 health check when you created the service.
    #
    #   Custom attributes
    #
    #   : You can add up to 30 custom attributes. For each key-value pair,
    #     the maximum length of the attribute name is 255 characters, and
