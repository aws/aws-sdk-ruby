Feature: Smoke tests for AutoScaling

Background:
  Given I create a client in region 'us-west-2'

  @autoscaling @smoke
  Scenario: Call Aws::AutoScaling::Client#describe_scaling_process_types and expect it to succeed
  When I call the operation 'describe_scaling_process_types' with params:
    """
{}
    """
  Then I expect an error was not raised

  @autoscaling @smoke
  Scenario: Call Aws::Aws::AutoScaling::Client#create_launch_configuration and expect it to fail
  When I call the operation 'create_launch_configuration' with params:
    """
{"launch_configuration_name":"hello, world","image_id":"ami-12345678","instance_type":"m1.small"}
    """
  Then I expect an error was raised
