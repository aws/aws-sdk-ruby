    #
    # @!attribute [rw] client_token
    #   ClientToken is an idempotency token that ensures a call to
    #   `DeleteProject` completes only once. You choose the value to pass.
    #   For example, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from
    #   `DeleteProject`. In this case, safely retry your call to
    #   `DeleteProject` by using the same `ClientToken` parameter value.
    #
    #   If you don't supply a value for `ClientToken`, the AWS SDK you are
    #   using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network
    #   error from making multiple project deletion requests. You'll need
    #   to provide your own value for other use cases.
    #
    #   An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in
    #   the first request. Using a different value for `ClientToken` is
    #   considered a new call to `DeleteProject`. An idempotency token is
    #   active for 8 hours.
    #
    #   **A suitable default value is auto-generated.** You should normally
    #   not need to pass this option.
