    #     rate`- The sample rate in the audio file doesn't match the sample
    #     rate specified in the `MediaSampleRateHertz` field in the request.

    #     file is larger than what Amazon Transcribe Medical can process.
    #     For more information, see [Guidelines and Quotas][1] in the

    # @!attribute [rw] media_sample_rate_hertz
    #   The sample rate, in Hertz, of the audio track in the input media

    #
    #   If you do not specify the media sample rate, Amazon Transcribe
    #   determines the sample rate. If you specify the sample rate, it must
    #   match the sample rate detected by Amazon Transcribe. In most cases,
    #   you should leave the `MediaSampleRateHertz` field blank and let
    #   Amazon Transcribe determine the sample rate.
    #   @return [Integer]

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] output_bucket_name
    #   The location where the transcription is stored.
    #
    #   If you set the `OutputBucketName`, Amazon Transcribe puts the
    #   transcript in the specified S3 bucket. When you call the
    #   GetTranscriptionJob operation, the operation returns this location
    #   in the `TranscriptFileUri` field. If you enable content redaction,
    #   the redacted transcript appears in `RedactedTranscriptFileUri`. If
    #   you enable content redaction and choose to output an unredacted
    #   transcript, that transcript's location still appears in the
    #   `TranscriptFileUri`. The S3 bucket must have permissions that allow
    #   Amazon Transcribe to put files in the bucket. For more information,
    #   see [Permissions Required for IAM User Roles][1].
    #
    #   You can specify an Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS)
    #   key to encrypt the output of your transcription using the
    #   `OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId` parameter. If you don't specify a KMS
    #   key, Amazon Transcribe uses the default Amazon S3 key for
    #   server-side encryption of transcripts that are placed in your S3
    #   bucket.
    #
    #   If you don't set the `OutputBucketName`, Amazon Transcribe
    #   generates a pre-signed URL, a shareable URL that provides secure
    #   access to your transcription, and returns it in the
    #   `TranscriptFileUri` field. Use this URL to download the
    #   transcription.

    #
    #   If you don't specify an output key, Amazon Transcribe stores the
    #   output of your transcription job in the Amazon S3 bucket you
    #   specified. By default, the object key is
    #   "your-transcription-job-name.json".
    #
    #   You can use output keys to specify the Amazon S3 prefix and file
    #   name of the transcription output. For example, specifying the Amazon
    #   S3 prefix, "folder1/folder2/", as an output key would lead to the
    #   output being stored as
    #   "folder1/folder2/your-transcription-job-name.json". If you specify
    #   "my-other-job-name.json" as the output key, the object key is
    #   changed to "my-other-job-name.json". You can use an output key to
    #   change both the prefix and the file name, for example
    #   "folder/my-other-job-name.json".

    #   transcription job. The user calling the `StartTranscriptionJob`
    #   operation must have permission to use the specified KMS key.

    #
    #   You can use either of the following to identify a KMS key in the

    #
    #   If you don't specify an encryption key, the output of the
    #   transcription job is encrypted with the default Amazon S3 key
    #   (SSE-S3).
