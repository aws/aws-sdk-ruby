    #   custom vocabulary filter, include `LanguageIdSettings` with the
    #   relevant sub-parameters (`VocabularyName`, `LanguageModelName`, and
    #   `VocabularyFilterName`).
    #
    #   `LanguageIdSettings` supports two to five language codes. Each
    #   language code you include can have an associated custom language
    #   model, custom vocabulary, and custom vocabulary filter. The language
    #   codes that you specify must match the languages of the associated
    #   custom language models, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary
    #   filters.
    #
    #   It's recommended that you include `LanguageOptions` when using
    #   `LanguageIdSettings` to ensure that the correct language dialect is
    #   identified. For example, if you specify a custom vocabulary that is
    #   in `en-US` but Amazon Transcribe determines that the language spoken
    #   in your media is `en-AU`, your custom vocabulary *is not* applied to
    #   your transcription. If you include `LanguageOptions` and include
    #   `en-US` as the only English language dialect, your custom vocabulary
    #   *is* applied to your transcription.
    #
    #   If you want to include a custom language model, custom vocabulary,
    #   or custom vocabulary filter with your request but **do not** want to
    #   use automatic language identification, use instead the ` parameter
    #   with the LanguageModelName, VocabularyName, or VocabularyFilterName
    #   sub-parameters.</p> For a list of languages supported with Call

    #
    #   1.  s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET

    #
    #   You can specify a KMS key to encrypt your output using the
    #   `OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId` parameter. If you don't specify a KMS
    #   key, Amazon Transcribe uses the default Amazon S3 key for
    #   server-side encryption.
    #
    #   If you don't specify `OutputLocation`, your transcript is placed in

    #   account, you can specify your KMS key in one of four ways:
    #
    #   1.  Use the KMS key ID itself. For example,
    #       `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
    #
    #   2.  Use an alias for the KMS key ID. For example,
    #       `alias/ExampleAlias`.
    #
    #   3.  Use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS key ID. For
    #       example,
    #       `arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
    #
    #   4.  Use the ARN for the KMS key alias. For example,
    #       `arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias`.
    #
    #   If using a key located in a **different** Amazon Web Services
    #   account than the current Amazon Web Services account, you can
    #   specify your KMS key in one of two ways:
    #
    #   1.  Use the ARN for the KMS key ID. For example,
    #       `arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
    #
    #   2.  Use the ARN for the KMS key alias. For example,
    #       `arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias`.
    #
    #   If you don't specify an encryption key, your output is encrypted
    #   with the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3).
    #
    #   If you specify a KMS key to encrypt your output, you must also
    #   specify an output location using the `OutputLocation` parameter.

    #
    #   For example, if you want your output stored in

    #
    #   If you don't specify the media sample rate, Amazon Transcribe
    #   determines it for you. If you specify the sample rate, it must match
    #   the rate detected by Amazon Transcribe. If there's a mismatch
    #   between the value that you specify and the value detected, your job
    #   fails. In most cases, you can omit `MediaSampleRateHertz` and let
    #   Amazon Transcribe determine the sample rate.

    #   The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where you want your transcription
    #   output stored. Do not include the `S3://` prefix of the specified
    #   bucket.
    #
    #   If you want your output to go to a sub-folder of this bucket,
    #   specify it using the `OutputKey` parameter; `OutputBucketName` only
    #   accepts the name of a bucket.
    #
    #   For example, if you want your output stored in
    #   `S3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET`, set `OutputBucketName` to
    #   `DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET`. However, if you want your output stored in
    #   `S3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/`, set `OutputBucketName` to
    #   `DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET` and `OutputKey` to `test-files/`.
    #
    #   Note that Amazon Transcribe must have permission to use the
    #   specified location. You can change Amazon S3 permissions using the
    #   [Amazon Web Services Management Console][1]. See also [Permissions
    #   Required for IAM User Roles][2].
    #
    #   If you don't specify `OutputBucketName`, your transcript is placed
    #   in a service-managed Amazon S3 bucket and you are provided with a

    #   same as the name you specified for your transcription job
    #   (`TranscriptionJobName`).
    #
    #   Here are some examples of how you can use `OutputKey`:
    #
    #   * If you specify 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the `OutputBucketName`
    #     and 'my-transcript.json' as the `OutputKey`, your transcription
    #     output path is `s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-transcript.json`.

    #   * If you specify 'my-first-transcription' as the
    #     `TranscriptionJobName`, 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the
    #     `OutputBucketName`, and 'my-transcript' as the `OutputKey`, your
    #     transcription output path is
    #     `s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-transcript/my-first-transcription.json`.
    #
    #   * If you specify 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the `OutputBucketName`
    #     and 'test-files/my-transcript.json' as the `OutputKey`, your
    #     transcription output path is

    #   The KMS key you want to use to encrypt your transcription output.
    #
    #   If using a key located in the **current** Amazon Web Services
    #   account, you can specify your KMS key in one of four ways:
    #
    #   1.  Use the KMS key ID itself. For example,
    #       `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
    #
    #   2.  Use an alias for the KMS key ID. For example,
    #       `alias/ExampleAlias`.
    #
    #   3.  Use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS key ID. For
    #       example,
    #       `arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
    #
    #   4.  Use the ARN for the KMS key alias. For example,
    #       `arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias`.
    #
    #   If using a key located in a **different** Amazon Web Services
    #   account than the current Amazon Web Services account, you can
    #   specify your KMS key in one of two ways:
    #
    #   1.  Use the ARN for the KMS key ID. For example,
    #       `arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
    #
    #   2.  Use the ARN for the KMS key alias. For example,
    #       `arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias`.
    #
    #   If you don't specify an encryption key, your output is encrypted
    #   with the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3).
    #
    #   If you specify a KMS key to encrypt your output, you must also
    #   specify an output location using the `OutputLocation` parameter.
    #
    #   Note that the role making the request must have permission to use

    #   (`IdentifyMultipleLanguages`) doesn't support custom language
    #   models.
    #
    #   `LanguageIdSettings` supports two to five language codes. Each
    #   language code you include can have an associated custom language
    #   model, custom vocabulary, and custom vocabulary filter. The language
    #   codes that you specify must match the languages of the associated
    #   custom language models, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary
    #   filters.
    #
    #   It's recommended that you include `LanguageOptions` when using
    #   `LanguageIdSettings` to ensure that the correct language dialect is
    #   identified. For example, if you specify a custom vocabulary that is
    #   in `en-US` but Amazon Transcribe determines that the language spoken
    #   in your media is `en-AU`, your custom vocabulary *is not* applied to
    #   your transcription. If you include `LanguageOptions` and include
    #   `en-US` as the only English language dialect, your custom vocabulary
    #   *is* applied to your transcription.
    #
    #   If you want to include a custom language model with your request but
    #   **do not** want to use automatic language identification, use
    #   instead the ` parameter with the LanguageModelName sub-parameter. If
    #   you want to include a custom vocabulary or a custom vocabulary
