    # This section describes operations that you can perform on an AWS
    # Elemental MediaStore container.
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] endpoint
    #   The DNS endpoint of the container. Use the endpoint to identify the
    #   specific container when sending requests to the data plane. The
    #   service assigns this value when the container is created. Once the
    #   value has been assigned, it does not change.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] creation_time
    #   Unix timestamp.
    #   @return [Time]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] arn
    #   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container. The ARN has the
    #   following format:
    #
    #   arn:aws:&lt;region&gt;\:&lt;account that owns this
    #   container&gt;\:container/&lt;name of container&gt;
    #
    #   For example:
    #   arn:aws:mediastore:us-west-2:111122223333:container/movies
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] name
    #   The name of the container.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] status
    #   The status of container creation or deletion. The status is one of
    #   the following: `CREATING`, `ACTIVE`, or `DELETING`. While the
    #   service is creating the container, the status is `CREATING`. When
    #   the endpoint is available, the status changes to `ACTIVE`.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] access_logging_enabled
    #   The state of access logging on the container. This value is `false`
    #   by default, indicating that AWS Elemental MediaStore does not send
    #   access logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. When you enable access
    #   logging on the container, MediaStore changes this value to `true`,
    #   indicating that the service delivers access logs for objects stored
    #   in that container to CloudWatch Logs.
    #   @return [Boolean]
