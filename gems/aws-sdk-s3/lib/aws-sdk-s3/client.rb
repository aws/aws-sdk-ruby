    # @overload initialize(options)
    #   @param [Hash] options
    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading static credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleWebIdentityCredentials` - Used when you need to
    #       assume a role after providing credentials via the web.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SSOCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from AWS SSO using an
    #       access token generated from `aws login`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ProcessCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       process that outputs to stdout.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ECSCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from
    #       instances running in ECS.
    #
    #     * `Aws::CognitoIdentityCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from the Cognito Identity service.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2/ECS IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts
    #       are very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #       `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` or `Aws::ECSCredentials` to
    #       enable retries and extended timeouts. Instance profile credential
    #       fetching can be disabled by setting ENV['AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED']
    #       to true.

    #     When `true` a MD5 checksum will be computed and sent in the Content Md5
    #     header for :put_object and :upload_part. When `false`, MD5 checksums
    #     will not be computed for these operations. Checksums are still computed
    #     for operations requiring them. Checksum errors returned by Amazon S3 are
    #     automatically retried up to `:retry_limit` times.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :convert_params (true)

    #       unsuccessful retries a client can make.
    #
    #     * `adaptive` - An experimental retry mode that includes all the
    #       functionality of `standard` mode along with automatic client side
    #       throttling.  This is a provisional mode that may change behavior
    #       in the future.
    #
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :s3_disable_multiregion_access_points (false)
    #     When set to `false` this will option will raise errors when multi-region

    #     For S3 ARNs passed into the `:bucket` parameter, this option will
    #     use the region in the ARN, allowing for cross-region requests to
    #     be made. Set to `false` to use the client's region instead.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :secret_access_key
    #
    #   @option options [String] :session_token
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #     Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #     fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #     the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #     {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #     ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #     requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :use_accelerate_endpoint (false)
    #     When set to `true`, accelerated bucket endpoints will be used
    #     for all object operations. You must first enable accelerate for

    #     When set to `true`, fips compatible endpoints will be used if available.
    #     When a `fips` region is used, the region is normalized and this config
    #     is set to `true`.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #     When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #     sending the request.
    #
    #   @option options [URI::HTTP,String] :http_proxy A proxy to send
    #     requests through.  Formatted like 'http://proxy.com:123'.

    #   @option options [Float] :http_idle_timeout (5) The number of
    #     seconds a connection is allowed to sit idle before it is
    #     considered stale.  Stale connections are closed and removed
    #     from the pool before making a request.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_continue_timeout (1) The number of
    #     seconds to wait for a 100-continue response before sending the
    #     request body.  This option has no effect unless the request has
    #     "Expect" header set to "100-continue".  Defaults to `nil` which
    #     disables this behaviour.  This value can safely be set per
    #     request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :ssl_timeout (nil) Sets the SSL timeout
    #     in seconds.
    #

    #     SSL peer certificates are verified when establishing a
    #     connection.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_bundle Full path to the SSL
    #     certificate authority bundle file that should be used when
    #     verifying peer certificates.  If you do not pass
    #     `:ssl_ca_bundle` or `:ssl_ca_directory` the the system default
    #     will be used if available.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_directory Full path of the
    #     directory that contains the unbundled SSL certificate
    #     authority files for verifying peer certificates.  If you do
    #     not pass `:ssl_ca_bundle` or `:ssl_ca_directory` the the
    #     system default will be used if available.

    # Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.
    #
    # You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts
    # using the [UploadPart][1] operation. After successfully uploading all
    # relevant parts of an upload, you call this action to complete the
    # upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the
    # parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the
    # Complete Multipart Upload request, you must provide the parts list.
    # You must ensure that the parts list is complete. This action
    # concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in
    # the list, you must provide the part number and the `ETag` value,
    # returned after that part was uploaded.
    #
    # Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several
    # minutes to complete. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it
    # sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While
    # processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space
    # characters to keep the connection from timing out. Because a request
    # could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is
    # important that you check the response body to determine whether the
    # request succeeded.
    #
    # Note that if `CompleteMultipartUpload` fails, applications should be
    # prepared to retry the failed requests. For more information, see
    # [Amazon S3 Error Best Practices][2].
    #
    # You cannot use `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` with
    # Complete Multipart Upload requests. Also, if you do not provide a
    # `Content-Type` header, `CompleteMultipartUpload` returns a 200 OK
    # response.

    # `CompleteMultipartUpload` has the following special errors:
    #
    # * Error code: `EntityTooSmall`
    #
    #   * Description: Your proposed upload is smaller than the minimum
    #     allowed object size. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size,
    #     except the last part.
    #
    #   * 400 Bad Request
    #
    # * Error code: `InvalidPart`
    #
    #   * Description: One or more of the specified parts could not be
    #     found. The part might not have been uploaded, or the specified
    #     entity tag might not have matched the part's entity tag.
    #
    #   * 400 Bad Request
    #
    # * Error code: `InvalidPartOrder`
    #
    #   * Description: The list of parts was not in ascending order. The
    #     parts list must be specified in order by part number.
    #
    #   * 400 Bad Request
    #
    # * Error code: `NoSuchUpload`
    #
    #   * Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The
    #     upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have
    #     been aborted or completed.

    # <note markdown="1"> You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You
    # create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic
    # action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB,
    # you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy (UploadPartCopy)
    # API. For more information, see [Copy Object Using the REST Multipart
    # Upload API][1].
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have
    # *read* access to the source object and *write* access to the
    # destination bucket. For more information, see [REST
    # Authentication][2]. Both the Region that you want to copy the object
    # from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be
    # enabled for your account.
    #
    # A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy
    # request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs
    # before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error.
    # If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is
    # embedded in the `200 OK` response. This means that a `200 OK` response
    # can contain either a success or an error. Design your application to
    # parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.
    #
    # If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information
    # about the copied object.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded.
    # If it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would
    # need to read the entire body.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that
    # you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see
    # [Amazon S3 pricing][3].
    #
    # Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies.
    # If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration
    # endpoint, you get a 400 `Bad Request` error. For more information, see
    # [Transfer Acceleration][4].
    #
    # **Metadata**
    #
    # When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or
    # specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to
    # private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL
    # setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more
    # information, see [Using ACLs][5].
    #
    # To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source
    # object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can
    # optionally add the `x-amz-metadata-directive` header. When you grant
    # permissions, you can use the `s3:x-amz-metadata-directive` condition
    # key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded.
    # For more information, see [Specifying Conditions in a Policy][6] in
    # the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For a complete list of Amazon S3-specific
    # condition keys, see [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon
    # S3][7].
    #
    # **x-amz-copy-source-if Headers**
    #
    # To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the
    # `Etag` matches or whether the object was modified before or after a
    # specified date, use the following request parameters:
    #
    # * `x-amz-copy-source-if-match`
    #
    # * `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`
    #
    # * `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`
    #
    # * `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`
    #
    # If both the `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` and
    # `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` headers are present in the
    # request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and copies
    # the data:
    #
    # * `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` condition evaluates to true
    #
    # * `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` condition evaluates to false
    #
    # If both the `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` and
    # `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` headers are present in the
    # request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the `412
    # Precondition Failed` response code:
    #
    # * `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` condition evaluates to false
    #
    # * `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` condition evaluates to true
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> All headers with the `x-amz-` prefix, including `x-amz-copy-source`,
    # must be signed.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # **Server-side encryption**
    #
    # When you perform a CopyObject operation, you can optionally use the
    # appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the object using
    # server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services managed encryption
    # keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) or a customer-provided encryption key. With
    # server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it
    # to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it.
    # For more information about server-side encryption, see [Using
    # Server-Side Encryption][8].
    #
    # If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for
    # the object. For more information, see [Amazon S3 Bucket Keys][9] in
    # the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # **Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers**
    #
    # When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant
    # ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the
    # owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant
    # permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to
    # predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then
    # added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see [Access
    # Control List (ACL) Overview][10] and [Managing ACLs Using the REST
    # API][11].
    #
    # If the bucket that you're copying objects to uses the bucket owner
    # enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no
    # longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept
    # PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify
    # bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the
    # `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL or an equivalent form of this
    # ACL expressed in the XML format.
    #
    # For more information, see [ Controlling ownership of objects and
    # disabling ACLs][12] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object
    # Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account will be
    # owned by the bucket owner.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # **Checksums**
    #
    # When copying an object, if it has a checksum, that checksum will be
    # copied to the new object by default. When you copy the object over,
    # you may optionally specify a different checksum algorithm to use with
    # the `x-amz-checksum-algorithm` header.
    #
    # **Storage Class Options**
    #
    # You can use the `CopyObject` action to change the storage class of an
    # object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the `StorageClass`
    # parameter. For more information, see [Storage Classes][13] in the
    # *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # **Versioning**
    #
    # By default, `x-amz-copy-source` identifies the current version of an
    # object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3
    # behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use
    # the `versionId` subresource.
    #
    # If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a
    # unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is
    # different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns
    # the version ID of the copied object in the `x-amz-version-id` response
    # header in the response.
    #
    # If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket,
    # the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.
    #
    # If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a
    # copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the
    # copy operation. For more information, see [RestoreObject][14].
    #
    # The following operations are related to `CopyObject`\:
    #
    # * [PutObject][15]
    #
    # * [GetObject][16]
    #
    # For more information, see [Copying Objects][17].

    # @option params [String] :acl
    #   The canned ACL to apply to the object.
    #
    #   This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :bucket
    #   The name of the destination bucket.
    #
    #   When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests
    #   to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
    #   *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com.
    #   When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
    #   Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
    #   name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access
    #   points][1] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    #   When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
    #   requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
    #   takes the form `
    #   AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`.
    #   When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web

    #
    # @option params [String] :content_disposition
    #   Specifies presentational information for the object.
    #
    # @option params [String] :content_encoding
    #   Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and
    #   thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type
    #   referenced by the Content-Type header field.
    #
    # @option params [String] :content_language
    #   The language the content is in.
    #
    # @option params [String] :content_type
    #   A standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :copy_source
    #   Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the
    #   value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access
    #   the source object through an [access point][1]\:
    #
    #   * For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name
    #     of the source bucket and the key of the source object, separated by
    #     a slash (/). For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf`
    #     from the bucket `awsexamplebucket`, use
    #     `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be
    #     URL-encoded.
    #
    #   * For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon
    #     Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access
    #     point, in the format
    #     `arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key>`.
    #     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through access
    #     point `my-access-point` owned by account `123456789012` in Region
    #     `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
    #     `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf`.
    #     The value must be URL encoded.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the
    #     source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services
    #     Region.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #     Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts,
    #     specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format
    #     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key>`.
    #     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through
    #     outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region
    #     `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
    #     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf`.
    #     The value must be URL-encoded.
    #
    #   To copy a specific version of an object, append
    #   `?versionId=<version-id>` to the value (for example,
    #   `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893`).
    #   If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest
    #   version of the source object.

    # Creates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with
    # Amazon S3 and have a valid Amazon Web Services Access Key ID to
    # authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create
    # buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.
    #
    # Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information about
    # bucket naming restrictions, see [Bucket naming rules][1].
    #
    # If you want to create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see [Create
    # Bucket][2].
    #
    # By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region.
    # You can optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might
    # choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address
    # regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you
    # will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe
    # (Ireland) Region. For more information, see [Accessing a bucket][3].
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> If you send your create bucket request to the `s3.amazonaws.com`
    # endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the
    # signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as
    # the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies
    # another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a
    # bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application
    # must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see
    # [Virtual hosting of buckets][4].
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # **Access control lists (ACLs)**
    #
    # When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally
    # configure the bucket ACL to specify the accounts or groups that should
    # be granted specific permissions on the bucket.
    #
    # If your CreateBucket request sets bucket owner enforced for S3 Object
    # Ownership and specifies a bucket ACL that provides access to an
    # external Amazon Web Services account, your request fails with a `400`
    # error and returns the `InvalidBucketAclWithObjectOwnership` error
    # code. For more information, see [Controlling object ownership][5] in
    # the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the
    # request headers.
    #
    # * Specify a canned ACL using the `x-amz-acl` request header. Amazon S3
    #   supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs*. Each
    #   canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For
    #   more information, see [Canned ACL][6].
    #
    # * Specify access permissions explicitly using the `x-amz-grant-read`,
    #   `x-amz-grant-write`, `x-amz-grant-read-acp`,
    #   `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers.
    #   These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an
    #   ACL. For more information, see [Access control list (ACL)
    #   overview][7].
    #
    #   You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one
    #   of the following:
    #
    #   * `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an
    #     Amazon Web Services account
    #
    #   * `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
    #
    #   * `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of an
    #     Amazon Web Services account
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in
    #     the following Amazon Web Services Regions:
    #
    #      * US East (N. Virginia)
    #
    #     * US West (N. California)
    #
    #     * US West (Oregon)
    #
    #     * Asia Pacific (Singapore)
    #
    #     * Asia Pacific (Sydney)
    #
    #     * Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
    #
    #     * Europe (Ireland)
    #
    #     * South America (São Paulo)
    #
    #      For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints,
    #     see [Regions and Endpoints][8] in the Amazon Web Services General
    #     Reference.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   For example, the following `x-amz-grant-read` header grants the
    #   Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions
    #   to read object data and its metadata:
    #
    #   `x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666" `
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions
    # explicitly. You cannot do both.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # **Permissions**
    #
    # In addition to `s3:CreateBucket`, the following permissions are
    # required when your CreateBucket includes specific headers:
    #
    # * **ACLs** - If your `CreateBucket` request specifies ACL permissions
    #   and the ACL is public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read,
    #   or if you specify access permissions explicitly through any other
    #   ACL, both `s3:CreateBucket` and `s3:PutBucketAcl` permissions are
    #   needed. If the ACL the `CreateBucket` request is private or doesn't
    #   specify any ACLs, only `s3:CreateBucket` permission is needed.
    #
    # * **Object Lock** - If `ObjectLockEnabledForBucket` is set to true in
    #   your `CreateBucket` request, `s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration`
    #   and `s3:PutBucketVersioning` permissions are required.
    #
    # * **S3 Object Ownership** - If your CreateBucket request includes the
    #   the `x-amz-object-ownership` header, `s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls`
    #   permission is required.
    #
    # The following operations are related to `CreateBucket`\:
    #
    # * [PutObject][9]
    #
    # * [DeleteBucket][10]

    # This action initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID.
    # This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific

    # subsequent upload part requests (see [UploadPart][1]). You also
    # include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or
    # abort the multipart upload request.
    #
    # For more information about multipart uploads, see [Multipart Upload
    # Overview][2].
    #
    # If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart
    # uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified
    # in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete
    # multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3
    # aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see [Aborting
    # Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy][3].
    #
    # For information about the permissions required to use the multipart
    # upload API, see [Multipart Upload and Permissions][4].
    #
    # For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular
    # requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests
    # to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You
    # sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing
    # multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see
    # [Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version
    # 4)][5].
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to
    # stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either
    # complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space
    # used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only
    # after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side
    # encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in
    # its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide
    # your own encryption key, or use Amazon Web Services KMS keys or Amazon
    # S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own
    # encryption key, the request headers you provide in [UploadPart][1] and
    # [UploadPartCopy][6] requests must match the headers you used in the
    # request to initiate the upload by using `CreateMultipartUpload`.
    #
    # To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Amazon Web
    # Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the
    # `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey*` actions on the key. These
    # permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data
    # from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart
    # upload. For more information, see [Multipart upload API and
    # permissions][7] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the
    # same Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key, then you must have
    # these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs
    # to a different account than the key, then you must have the
    # permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.
    #
    # For more information, see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side
    # Encryption][8].
    #
    # Access Permissions
    #
    # : When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or
    #   groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new
    #   object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the
    #   request headers:
    #
    #   * Specify a canned ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. For more
    #     information, see [Canned ACL][9].
    #
    #   * Specify access permissions explicitly with the `x-amz-grant-read`,
    #     `x-amz-grant-read-acp`, `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and
    #     `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers. These parameters map to the
    #     set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more
    #     information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview][10].
    #
    #   You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions
    #   explicitly. You cannot do both.
    #
    # Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers
    #
    # : You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using
    #   server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data
    #   encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to
    #   disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The
    #   option you use depends on whether you want to use Amazon Web
    #   Services managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key.
    #
    #   * Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer managed key
    #     stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web
    #     Services KMS) – If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys
    #     used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the
    #     request.
    #
    #     * `x-amz-server-side-encryption`
    #
    #     * `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`
    #
    #     * `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`, but don't
    #     provide `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, Amazon S3
    #     uses the Amazon Web Services managed key in Amazon Web Services
    #     KMS to protect the data.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #     All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by Amazon Web

    #     own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the
    #     request.
    #
    #     * `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`

    #
    # Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers
    #
    # : You also can use the following access control–related headers with
    #   this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner
    #   has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant
    #   permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to
    #   predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then
    #   added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more
    #   information, see [Using ACLs][12]. With this operation, you can
    #   grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:
    #
    #   * Specify a canned ACL (`x-amz-acl`) — Amazon S3 supports a set of
    #     predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs*. Each canned ACL has a
    #     predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information,
    #     see [Canned ACL][9].

    #   * Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access
    #     permissions to specific Amazon Web Services accounts or groups,
    #     use the following headers. Each header maps to specific
    #     permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more
    #     information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview][10]. In the
    #     header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific
    #     permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use:
    #
    #     * `x-amz-grant-read`
    #
    #     * `x-amz-grant-write`
    #
    #     * `x-amz-grant-read-acp`
    #
    #     * `x-amz-grant-write-acp`
    #
    #     * `x-amz-grant-full-control`
    #
    #     You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is
    #     one of the following:
    #
    #     * `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an
    #       Amazon Web Services account
    #
    #     * `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
    #
    #     * `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of
    #       an Amazon Web Services account
    #
    #       <note markdown="1"> Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in
    #       the following Amazon Web Services Regions:
    #
    #        * US East (N. Virginia)
    #
    #       * US West (N. California)
    #
    #       * US West (Oregon)
    #
    #       * Asia Pacific (Singapore)
    #
    #       * Asia Pacific (Sydney)
    #
    #       * Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
    #
    #       * Europe (Ireland)
    #
    #       * South America (São Paulo)
    #
    #        For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints,
    #       see [Regions and Endpoints][13] in the Amazon Web Services
    #       General Reference.
    #
    #        </note>
    #
    #     For example, the following `x-amz-grant-read` header grants the
    #     Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions
    #     to read object data and its metadata:
    #
    #     `x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666" `

    #
    # @option params [String] :sse_customer_key_md5
    #   Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to
    #   RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to
    #   ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
    #
    # @option params [String] :ssekms_key_id
    #   Specifies the ID of the symmetric customer managed key to use for
    #   object encryption. All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by

    # @option params [Boolean] :bucket_key_enabled
    #   Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
    #   encryption with server-side encryption using AWS KMS (SSE-KMS).
    #   Setting this header to `true` causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key
    #   for object encryption with SSE-KMS.
    #
    #   Specifying this header with an object action doesn’t affect
    #   bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key.
    #
    # @option params [String] :request_payer
    #   Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
    #   request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their

    # Deletes the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified

    #
    # The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize
    # storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective
    # storage access tier, without performance impact or operational
    # overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in
    # three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest
    # storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can
    # choose to activate additional archiving capabilities.
    #
    # The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class
    # for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns,
    # independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an
    # object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for
    # auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always
    # charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3
    # Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

    # This action enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using
    # a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to
    # delete, then this action provides a suitable alternative to sending
    # individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.
    #
    # The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to
    # delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally,
    # version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object
    # from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a
    # delete action and returns the result of that delete, success, or
    # failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the
    # request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.
    #
    # The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By
    # default, the action uses verbose mode in which the response includes
    # the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the
    # response includes only keys where the delete action encountered an
    # error. For a successful deletion, the action does not return any
    # information about the delete in the response body.
    #
    # When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that
    # attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA
    # token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even
    # if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you
    # provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the
    # request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For
    # information about MFA Delete, see [ MFA Delete][1].
    #
    # Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object
    # Delete requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your
    # request body has not been altered in transit.

    # Gets the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified

    #
    # The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize
    # storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective
    # storage access tier, without performance impact or operational
    # overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in
    # three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest
    # storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can
    # choose to activate additional archiving capabilities.
    #
    # The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class
    # for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns,
    # independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an
    # object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for
    # auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always
    # charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3
    # Intelligent-Tiering storage class.
    #
    # For more information, see [Storage class for automatically optimizing
    # frequently and infrequently accessed objects][1].

    # Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use `GET`, you must have `READ`
    # access to the object. If you grant `READ` access to the anonymous
    # user, you can return the object without using an authorization header.
    #
    # An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find
    # in a typical computer file system. You can, however, create a logical
    # hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For
    # example, instead of naming an object `sample.jpg`, you can name it
    # `photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`.
    #
    # To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key
    # name for the object in the `GET` operation. For a virtual hosted-style
    # request example, if you have the object
    # `photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`, specify the resource as
    # `/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`. For a path-style request example,
    # if you have the object `photos/2006/February/sample.jpg` in the bucket
    # named `examplebucket`, specify the resource as
    # `/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`. For more information
    # about request types, see [HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification][1].
    #
    # For more information about returning the ACL of an object, see
    # [GetObjectAcl][2].
    #
    # If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier or S3
    # Glacier Deep Archive storage class, or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive
    # or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, before you can retrieve
    # the object you must first restore a copy using [RestoreObject][3].
    # Otherwise, this action returns an `InvalidObjectStateError` error. For
    # information about restoring archived objects, see [Restoring Archived
    # Objects][4].
    #
    # Encryption request headers, like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`,
    # should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side
    # encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with
    # Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use
    # these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.
    #
    # If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with
    # customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in
    # Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following
    # headers:
    #
    # * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
    #
    # * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
    #
    # * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5
    #
    # For more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using
    # Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)][5].
    #
    # Assuming you have the relevant permission to read object tags, the
    # response also returns the `x-amz-tagging-count` header that provides
    # the count of number of tags associated with the object. You can use
    # [GetObjectTagging][6] to retrieve the tag set associated with an
    # object.
    #
    # **Permissions**
    #
    # You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this
    # operation. For more information, see [Specifying Permissions in a
    # Policy][7]. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon
    # S3 returns depends on whether you also have the `s3:ListBucket`
    # permission.
    #
    # * If you have the `s3:ListBucket` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3
    #   will return an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error.
    #
    # * If you don’t have the `s3:ListBucket` permission, Amazon S3 will
    #   return an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error.
    #
    # **Versioning**
    #
    # By default, the GET action returns the current version of an object.
    # To return a different version, use the `versionId` subresource.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> * If you supply a `versionId`, you need the `s3:GetObjectVersion`
    #   permission to access a specific version of an object. If you request
    #   a specific version, you do not need to have the `s3:GetObject`
    #   permission.
    #
    # * If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3
    #   behaves as if the object was deleted and includes
    #   `x-amz-delete-marker: true` in the response.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # For more information about versioning, see [PutBucketVersioning][8].
    #
    # **Overriding Response Header Values**
    #
    # There are times when you want to override certain response header
    # values in a GET response. For example, you might override the
    # `Content-Disposition` response header value in your GET request.
    #
    # You can override values for a set of response headers using the
    # following query parameters. These response header values are sent only
    # on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned.
    # The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset
    # of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The
    # response headers that you can override for the GET response are
    # `Content-Type`, `Content-Language`, `Expires`, `Cache-Control`,
    # `Content-Disposition`, and `Content-Encoding`. To override these
    # header values in the GET response, you use the following request
    # parameters.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a
    # presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with
    # an unsigned (anonymous) request.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # * `response-content-type`
    #
    # * `response-content-language`
    #
    # * `response-expires`
    #
    # * `response-cache-control`
    #
    # * `response-content-disposition`
    #
    # * `response-content-encoding`
    #
    # **Additional Considerations about Request Headers**
    #
    # If both of the `If-Match` and `If-Unmodified-Since` headers are
    # present in the request as follows: `If-Match` condition evaluates to
    # `true`, and; `If-Unmodified-Since` condition evaluates to `false`;
    # then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.
    #
    # If both of the `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers are
    # present in the request as follows:` If-None-Match` condition evaluates
    # to `false`, and; `If-Modified-Since` condition evaluates to `true`;
    # then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response code.
    #
    # For more information about conditional requests, see [RFC 7232][9].

    # Retrieves all the metadata from an object without returning the object
    # itself. This action is useful if you're interested only in an
    # object's metadata. To use `GetObjectAttributes`, you must have READ
    # access to the object.
    #
    # `GetObjectAttributes` combines the functionality of `GetObjectAcl`,
    # `GetObjectLegalHold`, `GetObjectLockConfiguration`,
    # `GetObjectRetention`, `GetObjectTagging`, `HeadObject`, and
    # `ListParts`. All of the data returned with each of those individual
    # calls can be returned with a single call to `GetObjectAttributes`.
    #
    # If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with
    # customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in
    # Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you
    # must use the following headers:
    #
    # * `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`
    #
    # * `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`
    #

    #
    # For more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using
    # Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)][1] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> * Encryption request headers, such as `x-amz-server-side-encryption`,
    #   should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side
    #   encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys stored in Amazon Web
    #   Services Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption
    #   with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does
    #   use these types of keys, you'll get an HTTP `400 Bad Request`
    #   error.
    #
    # * The last modified property in this case is the creation date of the

    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # Consider the following when using request headers:
    #
    # * If both of the `If-Match` and `If-Unmodified-Since` headers are
    #   present in the request as follows, then Amazon S3 returns the HTTP
    #   status code `200 OK` and the data requested:
    #
    #   * `If-Match` condition evaluates to `true`.
    #
    #   * `If-Unmodified-Since` condition evaluates to `false`.
    #
    # * If both of the `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers are
    #   present in the request as follows, then Amazon S3 returns the HTTP
    #   status code `304 Not Modified`\:
    #
    #   * `If-None-Match` condition evaluates to `false`.
    #
    #   * `If-Modified-Since` condition evaluates to `true`.
    #
    # For more information about conditional requests, see [RFC 7232][2].
    #
    # **Permissions**
    #
    # The permissions that you need to use this operation depend on whether
    # the bucket is versioned. If the bucket is versioned, you need both the
    # `s3:GetObjectVersion` and `s3:GetObjectVersionAttributes` permissions
    # for this operation. If the bucket is not versioned, you need the
    # `s3:GetObject` and `s3:GetObjectAttributes` permissions. For more
    # information, see [Specifying Permissions in a Policy][3] in the
    # *Amazon S3 User Guide*. If the object that you request does not exist,
    # the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the
    # `s3:ListBucket` permission.
    #
    # * If you have the `s3:ListBucket` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3
    #   returns an HTTP status code `404 Not Found` ("no such key") error.
    #
    # * If you don't have the `s3:ListBucket` permission, Amazon S3 returns
    #   an HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` ("access denied") error.

    #
    # A `HEAD` request has the same options as a `GET` action on an object.
    # The response is identical to the `GET` response except that there is
    # no response body. Because of this, if the `HEAD` request generates an
    # error, it returns a generic `404 Not Found` or `403 Forbidden` code.
    # It is not possible to retrieve the exact exception beyond these error
    # codes.
    #
    # If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with
    # customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in

    #
    # * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5
    #
    # For more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using
    # Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)][1].
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> * Encryption request headers, like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`,
    #   should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side
    #   encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with
    #   Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use
    #   these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.
    #
    # * The last modified property in this case is the creation date of the

    #  </note>
    #
    # Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see
    # [Common Request Headers][2].
    #
    # Consider the following when using request headers:
    #
    # * Consideration 1 – If both of the `If-Match` and
    #   `If-Unmodified-Since` headers are present in the request as follows:
    #
    #   * `If-Match` condition evaluates to `true`, and;
    #
    #   * `If-Unmodified-Since` condition evaluates to `false`;
    #
    #   Then Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and the data requested.
    #
    # * Consideration 2 – If both of the `If-None-Match` and
    #   `If-Modified-Since` headers are present in the request as follows:
    #
    #   * `If-None-Match` condition evaluates to `false`, and;
    #
    #   * `If-Modified-Since` condition evaluates to `true`;
    #
    #   Then Amazon S3 returns the `304 Not Modified` response code.
    #
    # For more information about conditional requests, see [RFC 7232][3].
    #
    # **Permissions**
    #
    # You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this
    # operation. For more information, see [Specifying Permissions in a
    # Policy][4]. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon
    # S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket
    # permission.
    #
    # * If you have the `s3:ListBucket` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3
    #   returns an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error.
    #
    # * If you don’t have the `s3:ListBucket` permission, Amazon S3 returns
    #   an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error.

    # Lists the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified

    #
    # The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize
    # storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective
    # storage access tier, without performance impact or operational
    # overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in
    # three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest
    # storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can
    # choose to activate additional archiving capabilities.
    #
    # The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class
    # for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns,
    # independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an
    # object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for
    # auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always
    # charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3
    # Intelligent-Tiering storage class.
    #
    # For more information, see [Storage class for automatically optimizing
    # frequently and infrequently accessed objects][1].

    # This action lists in-progress multipart uploads. An in-progress
    # multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated using
    # the Initiate Multipart Upload request, but has not yet been completed
    # or aborted.
    #
    # This action returns at most 1,000 multipart uploads in the response.
    # 1,000 multipart uploads is the maximum number of uploads a response
    # can include, which is also the default value. You can further limit
    # the number of uploads in a response by specifying the `max-uploads`
    # parameter in the response. If additional multipart uploads satisfy the
    # list criteria, the response will contain an `IsTruncated` element with
    # the value true. To list the additional multipart uploads, use the
    # `key-marker` and `upload-id-marker` request parameters.
    #
    # In the response, the uploads are sorted by key. If your application
    # has initiated more than one multipart upload using the same object
    # key, then uploads in the response are first sorted by key.
    # Additionally, uploads are sorted in ascending order within each key by
    # the upload initiation time.

    #
    # @option params [required, String] :bucket
    #   The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.
    #
    #   When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests
    #   to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
    #   *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com.
    #   When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
    #   Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
    #   name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access
    #   points][1] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    #   When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
    #   requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
    #   takes the form `
    #   AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`.
    #   When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
    #   Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the
    #   bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see
    #   [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts][2] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    #
    # @option params [String] :delimiter
    #   Character you use to group keys.
    #
    #   All keys that contain the same string between the prefix, if
    #   specified, and the first occurrence of the delimiter after the prefix
    #   are grouped under a single result element, `CommonPrefixes`. If you
    #   don't specify the prefix parameter, then the substring starts at the
    #   beginning of the key. The keys that are grouped under `CommonPrefixes`
    #   result element are not returned elsewhere in the response.
    #
    # @option params [String] :encoding_type
    #   Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys in the response and
    #   specifies the encoding method to use. An object key may contain any
    #   Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser cannot parse some
    #   characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For
    #   characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this
    #   parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.
    #
    # @option params [String] :key_marker
    #   Together with upload-id-marker, this parameter specifies the multipart
    #   upload after which listing should begin.
    #
    #   If `upload-id-marker` is not specified, only the keys
    #   lexicographically greater than the specified `key-marker` will be
    #   included in the list.
    #
    #   If `upload-id-marker` is specified, any multipart uploads for a key
    #   equal to the `key-marker` might also be included, provided those
    #   multipart uploads have upload IDs lexicographically greater than the
    #   specified `upload-id-marker`.
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :max_uploads
    #   Sets the maximum number of multipart uploads, from 1 to 1,000, to
    #   return in the response body. 1,000 is the maximum number of uploads
    #   that can be returned in a response.
    #
    # @option params [String] :prefix
    #   Lists in-progress uploads only for those keys that begin with the
    #   specified prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into
    #   different grouping of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make
    #   groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.)
    #
    # @option params [String] :upload_id_marker
    #   Together with key-marker, specifies the multipart upload after which
    #   listing should begin. If key-marker is not specified, the
    #   upload-id-marker parameter is ignored. Otherwise, any multipart
    #   uploads for a key equal to the key-marker might be included in the
    #   list only if they have an upload ID lexicographically greater than the
    #   specified `upload-id-marker`.
    #
    # @option params [String] :expected_bucket_owner
    #   The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by
    #   a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403
    #   Forbidden` (access denied).
    #
    # @return [Types::ListMultipartUploadsOutput] Returns a {Seahorse::Client::Response response} object which responds to the following methods:

    #
    # @option params [required, String] :bucket
    #   The bucket name that contains the objects.
    #
    # @option params [String] :delimiter
    #   A delimiter is a character that you specify to group keys. All keys
    #   that contain the same string between the `prefix` and the first
    #   occurrence of the delimiter are grouped under a single result element
    #   in CommonPrefixes. These groups are counted as one result against the
    #   max-keys limitation. These keys are not returned elsewhere in the
    #   response.
    #
    # @option params [String] :encoding_type
    #   Requests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys in the response and
    #   specifies the encoding method to use. An object key may contain any
    #   Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser cannot parse some
    #   characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For
    #   characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this
    #   parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.
    #
    # @option params [String] :key_marker
    #   Specifies the key to start with when listing objects in a bucket.
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :max_keys
    #   Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default
    #   the action returns up to 1,000 key names. The response might contain
    #   fewer keys but will never contain more. If additional keys satisfy the
    #   search criteria, but were not returned because max-keys was exceeded,
    #   the response contains &lt;isTruncated&gt;true&lt;/isTruncated&gt;. To
    #   return the additional keys, see key-marker and version-id-marker.
    #
    # @option params [String] :prefix
    #   Use this parameter to select only those keys that begin with the
    #   specified prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into
    #   different groupings of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make
    #   groups in the same way you'd use a folder in a file system.) You can
    #   use prefix with delimiter to roll up numerous objects into a single
    #   result under CommonPrefixes.
    #
    # @option params [String] :version_id_marker
    #   Specifies the object version you want to start listing from.
    #
    # @option params [String] :expected_bucket_owner
    #   The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by
    #   a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403
    #   Forbidden` (access denied).
    #

    # Sets the permissions on an existing bucket using access control lists
    # (ACL). For more information, see [Using ACLs][1]. To set the ACL of a
    # bucket, you must have `WRITE_ACP` permission.
    #
    # You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's
    # permissions:
    #
    # * Specify the ACL in the request body
    #
    # * Specify permissions using request headers
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the
    # request headers.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on
    # a bucket using either the request body or the headers. For example, if
    # you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the
    # request body, then you can continue to use that approach.
    #
    # If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object
    # Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You
    # must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects in
    # it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the
    # `AccessControlListNotSupported` error code. Requests to read ACLs are
    # still supported. For more information, see [Controlling object
    # ownership][2] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # **Access Permissions**
    #
    # You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:
    #
    # * Specify a canned ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. Amazon S3
    #   supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs*. Each
    #   canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify
    #   the canned ACL name as the value of `x-amz-acl`. If you use this
    #   header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your
    #   request. For more information, see [Canned ACL][3].
    #
    # * Specify access permissions explicitly with the `x-amz-grant-read`,
    #   `x-amz-grant-read-acp`, `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and
    #   `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers. When using these headers, you
    #   specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web
    #   Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the
    #   permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use
    #   the `x-amz-acl` header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to
    #   the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more
    #   information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview][4].
    #
    #   You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one
    #   of the following:
    #
    #   * `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an
    #     Amazon Web Services account
    #
    #   * `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
    #
    #   * `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of an
    #     Amazon Web Services account
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in
    #     the following Amazon Web Services Regions:
    #
    #      * US East (N. Virginia)
    #
    #     * US West (N. California)
    #
    #     * US West (Oregon)
    #
    #     * Asia Pacific (Singapore)

    #      For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints,
    #     see [Regions and Endpoints][5] in the Amazon Web Services General
    #     Reference.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   For example, the following `x-amz-grant-write` header grants create,
    #   overwrite, and delete objects permission to LogDelivery group
    #   predefined by Amazon S3 and two Amazon Web Services accounts
    #   identified by their email addresses.
    #
    #   `x-amz-grant-write:
    #   uri="http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery",
    #   id="111122223333", id="555566667777" `
    #
    # You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions
    # explicitly. You cannot do both.
    #
    # **Grantee Values**
    #
    # You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access
    # rights (using request elements) in the following ways:
    #
    # * By the person's ID:
    #
    #   `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    #   xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName>
    #   </Grantee>`
    #
    #   DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request
    #
    # * By URI:
    #
    #   `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    #   xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>`
    #
    # * By Email address:
    #
    #   `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    #   xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>`
    #
    #   The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a
    #   GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the
    #   following Amazon Web Services Regions:
    #
    #    * US East (N. Virginia)
    #
    #   * US West (N. California)

    # `s3:PutBucketCORS` action. By default, the bucket owner has this
    # permission and can grant it to others.
    #
    # You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service
    # cross-origin requests. For example, you might want to enable a request
    # whose origin is `http://www.example.com` to access your Amazon S3
    # bucket at `my.example.bucket.com` by using the browser's
    # `XMLHttpRequest` capability.
    #
    # To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add
    # the `cors` subresource to the bucket. The `cors` subresource is an XML
    # document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the
    # HTTP methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is
    # limited to 64 KB in size.
    #
    # When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight
    # OPTIONS request) against a bucket, it evaluates the `cors`
    # configuration on the bucket and uses the first `CORSRule` rule that
    # matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request.
    # For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:
    #
    # * The request's `Origin` header must match `AllowedOrigin` elements.
    #
    # * The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the
    #   `Access-Control-Request-Method` header in case of a pre-flight
    #   `OPTIONS` request must be one of the `AllowedMethod` elements.
    #
    # * Every header specified in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers`
    #   request header of a pre-flight request must match an `AllowedHeader`
    #   element.
    #

    # Sharing][1] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    #
    # The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize
    # storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective
    # storage access tier, without performance impact or operational
    # overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in
    # three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest
    # storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can
    # choose to activate additional archiving capabilities.
    #
    # The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class
    # for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns,
    # independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an
    # object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for
    # auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always
    # charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3
    # Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

    # By default, all Amazon S3 resources, including buckets, objects, and
    # related subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website
    # configuration) are private. Only the resource owner, the Amazon Web
    # Services account that created the resource, can access it. The
    # resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by
    # writing an access policy. For this operation, users must get the
    # `s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration` permission.
    #
    # You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit denial also
    # supersedes any other permissions. If you want to prevent users or
    # accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must
    # deny them permissions for the following actions:
    #
    # * `s3:DeleteObject`
    #
    # * `s3:DeleteObjectVersion`
    #
    # * `s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration`
    #
    # For more information about permissions, see [Managing Access
    # Permissions to your Amazon S3 Resources][3] in the *Amazon S3 User
    # Guide*.

    #
    # <note markdown="1"> Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle
    # rule using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a
    # combination of both. Accordingly, this section describes the latest
    # API. The previous version of the API supported filtering based only on
    # an object key name prefix, which is supported for backward
    # compatibility. For the related API description, see
    # [PutBucketLifecycle][2].
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # **Rules**
    #
    # You specify the lifecycle configuration in your request body. The
    # lifecycle configuration is specified as XML consisting of one or more
    # rules. An Amazon S3 Lifecycle configuration can have up to 1,000
    # rules. This limit is not adjustable. Each rule consists of the
    # following:
    #
    # * Filter identifying a subset of objects to which the rule applies.
    #   The filter can be based on a key name prefix, object tags, or a
    #   combination of both.
    #
    # * Status whether the rule is in effect.
    #
    # * One or more lifecycle transition and expiration actions that you
    #   want Amazon S3 to perform on the objects identified by the filter.
    #   If the state of your bucket is versioning-enabled or
    #   versioning-suspended, you can have many versions of the same object
    #   (one current version and zero or more noncurrent versions). Amazon
    #   S3 provides predefined actions that you can specify for current and
    #   noncurrent object versions.
    #
    # For more information, see [Object Lifecycle Management][3] and
    # [Lifecycle Configuration Elements][4].
    #
    # **Permissions**
    #
    # By default, all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets,
    # objects, and related subresources (for example, lifecycle
    # configuration and website configuration). Only the resource owner
    # (that is, the Amazon Web Services account that created it) can access
    # the resource. The resource owner can optionally grant access
    # permissions to others by writing an access policy. For this operation,
    # a user must get the `s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration` permission.
    #
    # You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit deny also
    # supersedes any other permissions. If you want to block users or
    # accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must
    # deny them permissions for the following actions:
    #
    # * `s3:DeleteObject`
    #
    # * `s3:DeleteObjectVersion`
    #
    # * `s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration`
    #
    # For more information about permissions, see [Managing Access
    # Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources][5].

    # Enables notifications of specified events for a bucket. For more
    # information about event notifications, see [Configuring Event
    # Notifications][1].
    #
    # Using this API, you can replace an existing notification
    # configuration. The configuration is an XML file that defines the event
    # types that you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destination where you
    # want Amazon S3 to publish an event notification when it detects an
    # event of the specified type.
    #
    # By default, your bucket has no event notifications configured. That
    # is, the notification configuration will be an empty
    # `NotificationConfiguration`.
    #
    # `<NotificationConfiguration>`
    #
    # `</NotificationConfiguration>`
    #
    # This action replaces the existing notification configuration with the
    # configuration you include in the request body.
    #
    # After Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies that any
    # Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) or Amazon Simple Queue
    # Service (Amazon SQS) destination exists, and that the bucket owner has
    # permission to publish to it by sending a test notification. In the
    # case of Lambda destinations, Amazon S3 verifies that the Lambda
    # function permissions grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function
    # from the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Configuring
    # Notifications for Amazon S3 Events][1].
    #
    # You can disable notifications by adding the empty
    # NotificationConfiguration element.
    #
    # For more information about the number of event notification
    # configurations that you can create per bucket, see [Amazon S3 service
    # quotas][2] in *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.
    #
    # By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a
    # bucket. However, bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant
    # permission to other users to set this configuration with
    # `s3:PutBucketNotification` permission.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your
    # notification configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda
    # function configurations. When you send a PUT request with this
    # configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages to your SNS topic. If the
    # message fails, the entire PUT action will fail, and Amazon S3 will not
    # add the configuration to your bucket.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # **Responses**
    #
    # If the configuration in the request body includes only one
    # `TopicConfiguration` specifying only the
    # `s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject` event type, the response will also
    # include the `x-amz-sns-test-message-id` header containing the message
    # ID of the test notification sent to the topic.

    # Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one. For
    # more information, see [Replication][1] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the
    # replication configuration, you provide the name of the destination
    # bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects, the
    # IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your
    # behalf, and other relevant information.
    #
    # A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can
    # contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects
    # to replicate by filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose
    # additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each
    # subset.
    #
    # To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a
    # replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule
    # element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or
    # more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the
    # configuration, you must also add the following elements:
    # `DeleteMarkerReplication`, `Status`, and `Priority`.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration,
    # Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more
    # information, see [Backward Compatibility][2].
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see [Using
    # Versioning][3].
    #
    # **Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects**
    #
    # By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate objects that are stored at
    # rest using server-side encryption with KMS keys. To replicate Amazon
    # Web Services KMS-encrypted objects, add the following:
    # `SourceSelectionCriteria`, `SseKmsEncryptedObjects`, `Status`,
    # `EncryptionConfiguration`, and `ReplicaKmsKeyID`. For information
    # about replication configuration, see [Replicating Objects Created with
    # SSE Using KMS keys][4].
    #
    # For information on `PutBucketReplication` errors, see [List of
    # replication-related error codes][5]
    #
    # **Permissions**
    #
    # To create a `PutBucketReplication` request, you must have
    # `s3:PutReplicationConfiguration` permissions for the bucket.
    #
    # By default, a resource owner, in this case the Amazon Web Services
    # account that created the bucket, can perform this operation. The
    # resource owner can also grant others permissions to perform the
    # operation. For more information about permissions, see [Specifying
    # Permissions in a Policy][6] and [Managing Access Permissions to Your
    # Amazon S3 Resources][7].
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> To perform this operation, the user or role performing the action must
    # have the [iam:PassRole][8] permission.

    # **Enabled**—Enables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All
    # objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.
    #
    # **Suspended**—Disables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All
    # objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null.
    #
    # If the versioning state has never been set on a bucket, it has no
    # versioning state; a [GetBucketVersioning][1] request does not return a
    # versioning state value.
    #
    # In order to enable MFA Delete, you must be the bucket owner. If you
    # are the bucket owner and want to enable MFA Delete in the bucket
    # versioning configuration, you must include the `x-amz-mfa request`
    # header and the `Status` and the `MfaDelete` request elements in a
    # request to set the versioning state of the bucket.
    #
    # If you have an object expiration lifecycle policy in your
    # non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent
    # delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent
    # expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle policy will
    # manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in the
    # version-enabled bucket. (A version-enabled bucket maintains one
    # current and zero or more noncurrent object versions.) For more
    # information, see [Lifecycle and Versioning][2].

    # Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a
    # bucket to add an object to it.
    #
    # Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success
    # response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket.
    #
    # Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write
    # requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the
    # last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you
    # need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use
    # versioning instead.
    #
    # To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the
    # `Content-MD5` header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the
    # object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match,
    # returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while
    # putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the
    # calculated MD5 value.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> * To successfully complete the `PutObject` request, you must have the
    #   `s3:PutObject` in your IAM permissions.
    #
    # * To successfully change the objects acl of your `PutObject` request,
    #   you must have the `s3:PutObjectAcl` in your IAM permissions.
    #
    # * The `Content-MD5` header is required for any request to upload an
    #   object with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object
    #   Lock. For more information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see [Amazon
    #   S3 Object Lock Overview][1] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # **Server-side Encryption**
    #
    # You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side
    # encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in
    # its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have
    # the option to provide your own encryption key or use Amazon Web
    # Services managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For more
    # information, see [Using Server-Side Encryption][2].
    #
    # If you request server-side encryption using Amazon Web Services Key
    # Management Service (SSE-KMS), you can enable an S3 Bucket Key at the
    # object-level. For more information, see [Amazon S3 Bucket Keys][3] in
    # the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # **Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers**
    #
    # You can use headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all
    # objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When
    # adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon
    # Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3.
    # These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more
    # information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview][4] and [Managing
    # ACLs Using the REST API][5].
    #
    # If the bucket that you're uploading objects to uses the bucket owner
    # enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no
    # longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept
    # PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify
    # bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the
    # `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL or an equivalent form of this
    # ACL expressed in the XML format. PUT requests that contain other ACLs
    # (for example, custom grants to certain Amazon Web Services accounts)
    # fail and return a `400` error with the error code
    # `AccessControlListNotSupported`.
    #
    # For more information, see [ Controlling ownership of objects and
    # disabling ACLs][6] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object
    # Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account will be
    # owned by the bucket owner.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # **Storage Class Options**
    #
    # By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
    # created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability
    # and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify
    # a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the
    # OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see [Storage Classes][7]
    # in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # **Versioning**
    #
    # If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically
    # generates a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3
    # returns this ID in the response. When you enable versioning for a
    # bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same
    # object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects.
    #
    # For more information about versioning, see [Adding Objects to
    # Versioning Enabled Buckets][8]. For information about returning the
    # versioning state of a bucket, see [GetBucketVersioning][9].

    #   object encryption. The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8
    #   string holding JSON with the encryption context key-value pairs.
    #
    # @option params [Boolean] :bucket_key_enabled
    #   Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
    #   encryption with server-side encryption using AWS KMS (SSE-KMS).
    #   Setting this header to `true` causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key
    #   for object encryption with SSE-KMS.

    # Uses the `acl` subresource to set the access control list (ACL)
    # permissions for a new or existing object in an S3 bucket. You must
    # have `WRITE_ACP` permission to set the ACL of an object. For more
    # information, see [What permissions can I grant?][1] in the *Amazon S3
    # User Guide*.
    #
    # This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
    #
    # Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on
    # an object using either the request body or the headers. For example,
    # if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using
    # the request body, you can continue to use that approach. For more
    # information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview][2] in the
    # *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object
    # Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You
    # must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects in
    # it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the
    # `AccessControlListNotSupported` error code. Requests to read ACLs are
    # still supported. For more information, see [Controlling object
    # ownership][3] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # **Access Permissions**
    #
    # You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:
    #
    # * Specify a canned ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. Amazon S3
    #   supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned
    #   ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the
    #   canned ACL name as the value of `x-amz-ac`l. If you use this header,
    #   you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your
    #   request. For more information, see [Canned ACL][4].
    #
    # * Specify access permissions explicitly with the `x-amz-grant-read`,
    #   `x-amz-grant-read-acp`, `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and
    #   `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers. When using these headers, you
    #   specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web
    #   Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the
    #   permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use
    #   `x-amz-acl` header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the
    #   set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more
    #   information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview][2].
    #
    #   You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one
    #   of the following:
    #
    #   * `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an
    #     Amazon Web Services account
    #
    #   * `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
    #
    #   * `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email address of an
    #     Amazon Web Services account
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in
    #     the following Amazon Web Services Regions:
    #
    #      * US East (N. Virginia)
    #
    #     * US West (N. California)
    #
    #     * US West (Oregon)
    #
    #     * Asia Pacific (Singapore)
    #
    #     * Asia Pacific (Sydney)

    #     * Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
    #
    #     * Europe (Ireland)
    #
    #     * South America (São Paulo)
    #
    #      For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints,
    #     see [Regions and Endpoints][5] in the Amazon Web Services General
    #     Reference.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   For example, the following `x-amz-grant-read` header grants list
    #   objects permission to the two Amazon Web Services accounts
    #   identified by their email addresses.
    #
    #   `x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com",
    #   emailAddress="abc@amazon.com" `
    #
    # You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions
    # explicitly. You cannot do both.
    #
    # **Grantee Values**
    #
    # You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access
    # rights (using request elements) in the following ways:
    #
    # * By the person's ID:
    #
    #   `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    #   xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName>
    #   </Grantee>`
    #
    #   DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.
    #
    # * By URI:
    #
    #   `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    #   xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>`
    #
    # * By Email address:
    #
    #   `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    #   xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>`
    #
    #   The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a
    #   GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the
    #   following Amazon Web Services Regions:
    #
    #    * US East (N. Virginia)
    #

    #
    # **Versioning**
    #
    # The ACL of an object is set at the object version level. By default,
    # PUT sets the ACL of the current version of an object. To set the ACL
    # of a different version, use the `versionId` subresource.

    # Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3
    #
    # This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
    #
    # This action performs the following types of requests:
    #
    # * `select` - Perform a select query on an archived object
    #
    # * `restore an archive` - Restore an archived object
    #
    # To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
    # `s3:RestoreObject` action. The bucket owner has this permission by
    # default and can grant this permission to others. For more information
    # about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource
    # Operations][1] and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3
    # Resources][2] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # **Querying Archives with Select Requests**
    #
    # You use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived
    # objects. The archived objects that are being queried by the select
    # request must be formatted as uncompressed comma-separated values (CSV)
    # files. You can run queries and custom analytics on your archived data
    # without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an
    # overview about select requests, see [Querying Archived Objects][3] in
    # the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # When making a select request, do the following:
    #
    # * Define an output location for the select query's output. This must
    #   be an Amazon S3 bucket in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the
    #   bucket that contains the archive object that is being queried. The
    #   Amazon Web Services account that initiates the job must have
    #   permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You can specify the storage
    #   class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket.
    #   For more information about output, see [Querying Archived
    #   Objects][3] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    #   For more information about the `S3` structure in the request body,
    #   see the following:
    #
    #   * [PutObject][4]
    #
    #   * [Managing Access with ACLs][5] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*
    #
    #   * [Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption][6] in the *Amazon
    #     S3 User Guide*
    #
    # * Define the SQL expression for the `SELECT` type of restoration for
    #   your query in the request body's `SelectParameters` structure. You
    #   can use expressions like the following examples.
    #
    #   * The following expression returns all records from the specified
    #     object.
    #
    #     `SELECT * FROM Object`
    #
    #   * Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the
    #     object, you can specify columns with positional headers.
    #
    #     `SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 > 100`
    #
    #   * If you have headers and you set the `fileHeaderInfo` in the `CSV`
    #     structure in the request body to `USE`, you can specify headers in
    #     the query. (If you set the `fileHeaderInfo` field to `IGNORE`, the
    #     first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot mix ordinal
    #     positions with header column names.
    #
    #     `SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s`
    #
    # For more information about using SQL with S3 Glacier Select restore,
    # see [SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select][7] in
    # the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # When making a select request, you can also do the following:
    #
    # * To expedite your queries, specify the `Expedited` tier. For more
    #   information about tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this
    #   topic.
    #
    # * Specify details about the data serialization format of both the
    #   input object that is being queried and the serialization of the
    #   CSV-encoded query results.
    #
    # The following are additional important facts about the select feature:
    #
    # * The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive
    #   retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or
    #   through a lifecycle policy.
    #
    # * You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3
    #   object. Amazon S3 doesn't deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing
    #   duplicate requests.
    #
    # * Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already
    #   been restored. A select request doesn’t return error response `409`.
    #
    # **Restoring objects**
    #
    # Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive
    # storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3
    # Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers are not accessible in real
    # time. For objects in Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers you
    # must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object
    # is moved into the Frequent Access tier. For objects in S3 Glacier or
    # S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must first initiate a
    # restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is
    # available. To access an archived object, you must restore the object
    # for the duration (number of days) that you specify.
    #
    # To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If
    # you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current
    # version.
    #
    # When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can
    # specify one of the following data access tier options in the `Tier`
    # element of the request body:
    #
    # * `Expedited` - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your
    #   data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3
    #   Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for
    #   a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived
    #   objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is
    #   typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity
    #   ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is
    #   available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned
    #   capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep
    #   Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.
    #
    # * `Standard` - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your
    #   archived objects within several hours. This is the default option
    #   for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option.
    #   Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects
    #   stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
    #   Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects
    #   stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3
    #   Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free
    #   for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
    #
    # * `Bulk` - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval option in S3
    #   Glacier, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of
    #   data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12
    #   hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3
    #   Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 48
    #   hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage
    #   class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Bulk retrievals
    #   are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
    #
    # For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned
    # capacity for `Expedited` data access, see [Restoring Archived
    # Objects][8] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore
    # speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information,
    # see [ Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore][9] in the *Amazon
    # S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # To get the status of object restoration, you can send a `HEAD`
    # request. Operations return the `x-amz-restore` header, which provides
    # information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use
    # Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is
    # initiated or completed. For more information, see [Configuring Amazon
    # S3 Event Notifications][10] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration
    # period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates
    # the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only
    # for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update
    # the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your
    # current restore request for the object.
    #
    # If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes
    # an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span
    # that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an
    # object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3
    # days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information
    # about lifecycle configuration, see
    # [PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration][11] and [Object Lifecycle
    # Management][12] in *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # **Responses**
    #
    # A successful action returns either the `200 OK` or `202 Accepted`
    # status code.
    #
    # * If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns
    #   `202 Accepted` in the response.
    #
    # * If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` in
    #   the response.
    #
    # **Special Errors**
    #
    # * * *Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress*
    #
    #   * *Cause: Object restore is already in progress. (This error does
    #     not apply to SELECT type requests.)*
    #
    #   * *HTTP Status Code: 409 Conflict*
    #
    #   * *SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client*
    #
    # * * *Code: GlacierExpeditedRetrievalNotAvailable*
    #

    # @option params [required, String] :bucket
    #   The bucket name containing the object to restore.
    #
    #   When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests
    #   to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
    #   *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com.
    #   When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
    #   Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
    #   name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access
    #   points][1] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    #   When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
    #   requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
    #   takes the form `
    #   AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`.
    #   When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
    #   Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the
    #   bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see
    #   [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts][2] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    # @option params [String] :checksum_algorithm
    #   Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object
    #   when using the SDK. This header will not provide any additional
    #   functionality if not using the SDK. When sending this header, there
    #   must be a corresponding `x-amz-checksum` or `x-amz-trailer` header
    #   sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code
    #   `400 Bad Request`. For more information, see [Checking object
    #   integrity][1] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #

    # This action filters the contents of an Amazon S3 object based on a
    # simple structured query language (SQL) statement. In the request,
    # along with the SQL expression, you must also specify a data
    # serialization format (JSON, CSV, or Apache Parquet) of the object.
    # Amazon S3 uses this format to parse object data into records, and
    # returns only records that match the specified SQL expression. You must
    # also specify the data serialization format for the response.
    #
    # This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.
    #
    # For more information about Amazon S3 Select, see [Selecting Content
    # from Objects][1] and [SELECT Command][2] in the *Amazon S3 User
    # Guide*.
    #
    # For more information about using SQL with Amazon S3 Select, see [ SQL
    # Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select][3] in the
    # *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    #
    #
    # **Permissions**
    #
    # You must have `s3:GetObject` permission for this operation. Amazon S3
    # Select does not support anonymous access. For more information about
    # permissions, see [Specifying Permissions in a Policy][4] in the
    # *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    #
    #
    # *Object Data Formats*
    #
    # You can use Amazon S3 Select to query objects that have the following
    # format properties:
    #
    # * *CSV, JSON, and Parquet* - Objects must be in CSV, JSON, or Parquet
    #   format.
    #
    # * *UTF-8* - UTF-8 is the only encoding type Amazon S3 Select supports.
    #
    # * *GZIP or BZIP2* - CSV and JSON files can be compressed using GZIP or
    #   BZIP2. GZIP and BZIP2 are the only compression formats that Amazon
    #   S3 Select supports for CSV and JSON files. Amazon S3 Select supports
    #   columnar compression for Parquet using GZIP or Snappy. Amazon S3
    #   Select does not support whole-object compression for Parquet
    #   objects.
    #
    # * *Server-side encryption* - Amazon S3 Select supports querying
    #   objects that are protected with server-side encryption.
    #
    #   For objects that are encrypted with customer-provided encryption
    #   keys (SSE-C), you must use HTTPS, and you must use the headers that
    #   are documented in the [GetObject][5]. For more information about
    #   SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided
    #   Encryption Keys)][6] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    #   For objects that are encrypted with Amazon S3 managed encryption
    #   keys (SSE-S3) and Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS),
    #   server-side encryption is handled transparently, so you don't need
    #   to specify anything. For more information about server-side
    #   encryption, including SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS, see [Protecting Data Using
    #   Server-Side Encryption][7] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # **Working with the Response Body**
    #
    # Given the response size is unknown, Amazon S3 Select streams the
    # response as a series of messages and includes a `Transfer-Encoding`
    # header with `chunked` as its value in the response. For more
    # information, see [Appendix: SelectObjectContent Response][8].
    #
    #
    #
    # **GetObject Support**
    #
    # The `SelectObjectContent` action does not support the following
    # `GetObject` functionality. For more information, see [GetObject][5].
    #
    # * `Range`\: Although you can specify a scan range for an Amazon S3
    #   Select request (see [SelectObjectContentRequest - ScanRange][9] in
    #   the request parameters), you cannot specify the range of bytes of an
    #   object to return.
    #
    # * GLACIER, DEEP\_ARCHIVE and REDUCED\_REDUNDANCY storage classes: You
    #   cannot specify the GLACIER, DEEP\_ARCHIVE, or `REDUCED_REDUNDANCY`
    #   storage classes. For more information, about storage classes see
    #   [Storage Classes][10] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    #
    #
    # **Special Errors**
    #
    # For a list of special errors for this operation, see [List of SELECT
    # Object Content Error Codes][11]

    #
    # @return [Types::SelectObjectContentOutput] Returns a {Seahorse::Client::Response response} object which responds to the following methods:
    #
    #   * {Types::SelectObjectContentOutput#payload #payload} => Types::SelectObjectContentEventStream
    #
    # @example EventStream Operation Example
    #
    #   You can process event once it arrives immediately, or wait until
    #   full response complete and iterate through eventstream enumerator.
    #
    #   To interact with event immediately, you need to register #select_object_content
    #   with callbacks, callbacks can be register for specifc events or for all events,
    #   callback for errors in the event stream is also available for register.
    #
    #   Callbacks can be passed in by `:event_stream_handler` option or within block
    #   statement attached to #select_object_content call directly. Hybrid pattern of both
    #   is also supported.
    #
    #   `:event_stream_handler` option takes in either Proc object or
    #   Aws::S3::EventStreams::SelectObjectContentEventStream object.
    #
    #   Usage pattern a): callbacks with a block attached to #select_object_content
    #     Example for registering callbacks for all event types and error event
    #
    #     client.select_object_content( # params input# ) do |stream|
    #       stream.on_error_event do |event|
    #         # catch unmodeled error event in the stream
    #         raise event
    #         # => Aws::Errors::EventError
    #         # event.event_type => :error
    #         # event.error_code => String
    #         # event.error_message => String

    # Uploads a part in a multipart upload.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you
    # have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data
    # source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an
    # existing object, you use the [UploadPartCopy][1] operation.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # You must initiate a multipart upload (see [CreateMultipartUpload][2])
    # before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request,
    # Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must
    # include in your upload part request.
    #
    # Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part
    # number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within
    # the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part
    # number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded
    # part is overwritten.
    #
    # For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other
    # multipart upload specifications, see [Multipart upload limits][3] in
    # the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network,
    # specify the `Content-MD5` header in the upload part request. Amazon S3
    # checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not
    # match, Amazon S3 returns an error.
    #
    # If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon
    # Web Services S3 uses the `x-amz-content-sha256` header as a checksum
    # instead of `Content-MD5`. For more information see [Authenticating
    # Requests: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services
    # Signature Version 4)][4].
    #
    # **Note:** After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more
    # parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to
    # stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you
    # either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the
    # parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.
    #
    # For more information on multipart uploads, go to [Multipart Upload
    # Overview][5] in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide </i>.

    # upload API, go to [Multipart Upload and Permissions][6] in the *Amazon

    #
    # You can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon S3
    # encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and
    # decrypts it for you when you access it. You have the option of
    # providing your own encryption key, or you can use the Amazon Web
    # Services managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own
    # encryption key, the request headers you provide in the request must
    # match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by
    # using [CreateMultipartUpload][2]. For more information, go to [Using
    # Server-Side Encryption][7] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload
    # actions. Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key, you
    # don't need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart
    # request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption
    # parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more
    # information, see [CreateMultipartUpload][2].
    #
    # If you requested server-side encryption using a customer-provided
    # encryption key in your initiate multipart upload request, you must
    # provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the
    # following headers.

    #
    # For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other

    #
    # <note markdown="1"> Instead of using an existing object as part data, you might use the

    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part.
    # In response to your initiate request. Amazon S3 returns a unique
    # identifier, the upload ID, that you must include in your upload part
    # request.
    #
    # For more information about using the `UploadPartCopy` operation, see
    # the following:
    #
    # * For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see [Uploading
    #   Objects Using Multipart Upload][3] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # * For information about permissions required to use the multipart
    #   upload API, see [Multipart Upload and Permissions][4] in the *Amazon
    #   S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # * For information about copying objects using a single atomic action
    #   vs. a multipart upload, see [Operations on Objects][5] in the
    #   *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # * For information about using server-side encryption with
    #   customer-provided encryption keys with the `UploadPartCopy`
    #   operation, see [CopyObject][6] and [UploadPart][2].
    #
    # Note the following additional considerations about the request headers
    # `x-amz-copy-source-if-match`, `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`,
    # `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`, and
    # `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`\:
    #
    #
    #
    # * **Consideration 1** - If both of the `x-amz-copy-source-if-match`
    #   and `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` headers are present in
    #   the request as follows:
    #
    #   `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` condition evaluates to `true`, and;
    #
    #   `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` condition evaluates to
    #   `false`;
    #
    #   Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and copies the data.
    #
    # * **Consideration 2** - If both of the
    #   `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` and
    #   `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` headers are present in the
    #   request as follows:
    #
    #   `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` condition evaluates to `false`,
    #   and;
    #
    #   `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` condition evaluates to `true`;
    #
    #   Amazon S3 returns `412 Precondition Failed` response code.
    #
    # **Versioning**
    #
    # If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple
    # versions of the same object. By default, `x-amz-copy-source`
    # identifies the current version of the object to copy. If the current
    # version is a delete marker and you don't specify a versionId in the
    # `x-amz-copy-source`, Amazon S3 returns a 404 error, because the object
    # does not exist. If you specify versionId in the `x-amz-copy-source`
    # and the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400
    # error, because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a
    # version for the `x-amz-copy-source`.
    #
    # You can optionally specify a specific version of the source object to
    # copy by adding the `versionId` subresource as shown in the following
    # example:
    #
    # `x-amz-copy-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id`
    #
    # **Special Errors**
    #
    # * * *Code: NoSuchUpload*
    #
    #   * *Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload
    #     ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been
    #     aborted or completed.*
    #
    #   * *HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found*
    #
    # * * *Code: InvalidRequest*
    #
    #   * *Cause: The specified copy source is not supported as a byte-range
    #     copy source.*
    #
    #   * *HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request*

    # @option params [required, String] :bucket
    #   The bucket name.
    #
    #   When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests
    #   to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
    #   *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com.
    #   When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
    #   Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
    #   name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access
    #   points][1] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    #   When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
    #   requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
    #   takes the form `
    #   AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`.
    #   When using this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web
    #   Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the
    #   bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see

    # @option params [required, String] :copy_source
    #   Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the
    #   value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access
    #   the source object through an [access point][1]\:
    #
    #   * For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name
    #     of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a
    #     slash (/). For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf`
    #     from the bucket `awsexamplebucket`, use
    #     `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be
    #     URL-encoded.
    #
    #   * For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon
    #     Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access
    #     point, in the format
    #     `arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key>`.
    #     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through access
    #     point `my-access-point` owned by account `123456789012` in Region
    #     `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
    #     `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf`.
    #     The value must be URL encoded.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the
    #     source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services
    #     Region.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #     Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts,
    #     specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format
    #     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key>`.
    #     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through
    #     outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region
    #     `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
    #     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf`.
    #     The value must be URL-encoded.
    #
    #   To copy a specific version of an object, append
    #   `?versionId=<version-id>` to the value (for example,
    #   `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893`).
    #   If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest
    #   version of the source object.

    #
    # @option params [String] :copy_source_range
    #   The range of bytes to copy from the source object. The range value
    #   must use the form bytes=first-last, where the first and last are the
    #   zero-based byte offsets to copy. For example, bytes=0-9 indicates that
    #   you want to copy the first 10 bytes of the source. You can copy a
    #   range only if the source object is greater than 5 MB.
    #

    # Passes transformed objects to a `GetObject` operation when using
    # Object Lambda access points. For information about Object Lambda
    # access points, see [Transforming objects with Object Lambda access
    # points][1] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    # This operation supports metadata that can be returned by
    # [GetObject][2], in addition to `RequestRoute`, `RequestToken`,
    # `StatusCode`, `ErrorCode`, and `ErrorMessage`. The `GetObject`
    # response metadata is supported so that the `WriteGetObjectResponse`
    # caller, typically an Lambda function, can provide the same metadata
    # when it internally invokes `GetObject`. When `WriteGetObjectResponse`
    # is called by a customer-owned Lambda function, the metadata returned
    # to the end user `GetObject` call might differ from what Amazon S3
    # would normally return.
    #
    # You can include any number of metadata headers. When including a
    # metadata header, it should be prefaced with `x-amz-meta`. For example,
    # `x-amz-meta-my-custom-header: MyCustomValue`. The primary use case for
    # this is to forward `GetObject` metadata.
    #
    # Amazon Web Services provides some prebuilt Lambda functions that you
    # can use with S3 Object Lambda to detect and redact personally
    # identifiable information (PII) and decompress S3 objects. These Lambda
    # functions are available in the Amazon Web Services Serverless
    # Application Repository, and can be selected through the Amazon Web
    # Services Management Console when you create your Object Lambda access
    # point.
    #
    # Example 1: PII Access Control - This Lambda function uses Amazon
    # Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service using machine
    # learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically
    # detects personally identifiable information (PII) such as names,
    # addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers
    # from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.
    #
    # Example 2: PII Redaction - This Lambda function uses Amazon
    # Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service using machine
    # learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically
    # redacts personally identifiable information (PII) such as names,
    # addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers
    # from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.
    #
    # Example 3: Decompression - The Lambda function
    # S3ObjectLambdaDecompression, is equipped to decompress objects stored
    # in S3 in one of six compressed file formats including bzip2, gzip,
    # snappy, zlib, zstandard and ZIP.
    #
    # For information on how to view and use these functions, see [Using
    # Amazon Web Services built Lambda functions][3] in the *Amazon S3 User
    # Guide*.

    # Polls an API operation until a resource enters a desired state.
    #
    # ## Basic Usage
    #
    # A waiter will call an API operation until:
    #
    # * It is successful
    # * It enters a terminal state
    # * It makes the maximum number of attempts
    #
    # In between attempts, the waiter will sleep.
    #
    #     # polls in a loop, sleeping between attempts
    #     client.wait_until(waiter_name, params)
    #
    # ## Configuration
    #
    # You can configure the maximum number of polling attempts, and the
    # delay (in seconds) between each polling attempt. You can pass
    # configuration as the final arguments hash.
    #
    #     # poll for ~25 seconds
    #     client.wait_until(waiter_name, params, {
    #       max_attempts: 5,
    #       delay: 5,
    #     })
    #
    # ## Callbacks
    #
    # You can be notified before each polling attempt and before each
    # delay. If you throw `:success` or `:failure` from these callbacks,
    # it will terminate the waiter.
    #
    #     started_at = Time.now
    #     client.wait_until(waiter_name, params, {
    #
    #       # disable max attempts
    #       max_attempts: nil,
    #
    #       # poll for 1 hour, instead of a number of attempts
    #       before_wait: -> (attempts, response) do
    #         throw :failure if Time.now - started_at > 3600
    #       end
    #     })
    #
    # ## Handling Errors
    #
    # When a waiter is unsuccessful, it will raise an error.
    # All of the failure errors extend from
    # {Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed}.
    #
    #     begin
    #       client.wait_until(...)
    #     rescue Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed
    #       # resource did not enter the desired state in time
    #     end
    #
    # ## Valid Waiters
    #
    # The following table lists the valid waiter names, the operations they call,
    # and the default `:delay` and `:max_attempts` values.
    #
    # | waiter_name       | params               | :delay   | :max_attempts |
