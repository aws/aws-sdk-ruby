    # @deprecated Use [Aws::S3::Client] #wait_until instead
    #
    # Waiter polls an API operation until a resource enters a desired
    # state.
    #
    # @note The waiting operation is performed on a copy. The original resource
    #   remains unchanged.
    #
    # ## Basic Usage
    #
    # Waiter will polls until it is successful, it fails by
    # entering a terminal state, or until a maximum number of attempts
    # are made.
    #
    #     # polls in a loop until condition is true
    #     resource.wait_until(options) {|resource| condition}
    #
    # ## Example
    #
    #     instance.wait_until(max_attempts:10, delay:5) do |instance|
    #       instance.state.name == 'running'
    #     end
    #
    # ## Configuration
    #
    # You can configure the maximum number of polling attempts, and the
    # delay (in seconds) between each polling attempt. The waiting condition is
    # set by passing a block to {#wait_until}:
    #
    #     # poll for ~25 seconds
    #     resource.wait_until(max_attempts:5,delay:5) {|resource|...}
    #
    # ## Callbacks
    #
    # You can be notified before each polling attempt and before each
    # delay. If you throw `:success` or `:failure` from these callbacks,
    # it will terminate the waiter.
    #
    #     started_at = Time.now
    #     # poll for 1 hour, instead of a number of attempts
    #     proc = Proc.new do |attempts, response|
    #       throw :failure if Time.now - started_at > 3600
    #     end
    #
    #       # disable max attempts
    #     instance.wait_until(before_wait:proc, max_attempts:nil) {...}
    #
    # ## Handling Errors
    #
    # When a waiter is successful, it returns the Resource. When a waiter
    # fails, it raises an error.
    #
    #     begin
    #       resource.wait_until(...)

    # @param [Hash] options ({})
    # @option options [required, String] :copy_source
    #   Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the
    #   value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access
    #   the source object through an [access point][1]:
    #
    #   * For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name
    #     of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a
    #     slash (/). For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf`
    #     from the bucket `awsexamplebucket`, use
    #     `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be
    #     URL-encoded.
    #
    #   * For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon
    #     Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access
    #     point, in the format
    #     `arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key>`.
    #     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through access
    #     point `my-access-point` owned by account `123456789012` in Region
    #     `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
    #     `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf`.
    #     The value must be URL encoded.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the
    #     source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services
    #     Region.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #     Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts,
    #     specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format
    #     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key>`.
    #     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through
    #     outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region
    #     `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
    #     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf`.
    #     The value must be URL-encoded.
    #
    #   To copy a specific version of an object, append
    #   `?versionId=<version-id>` to the value (for example,
    #   `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893`).
    #   If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest
    #   version of the source object.

    #   Copies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.
    # @option options [String] :copy_source_if_none_match

    #   Copies the object if it hasn't been modified since the specified

    #   The range of bytes to copy from the source object. The range value
    #   must use the form bytes=first-last, where the first and last are the
    #   zero-based byte offsets to copy. For example, bytes=0-9 indicates that
