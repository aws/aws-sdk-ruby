    #   Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the

    #   the source object through an [access point][1]:
    #
    #   * For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name
    #     of the source bucket and the key of the source object, separated
    #     by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object
    #     `reports/january.pdf` from the bucket `awsexamplebucket`, use
    #     `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be
    #     URL-encoded.
    #
    #   * For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon
    #     Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access
    #     point, in the format
    #     `arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key>`.
    #     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through
    #     access point `my-access-point` owned by account `123456789012` in
    #     Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
    #     `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf`.
    #     The value must be URL encoded.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when
    #     the source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web
    #     Services Region.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #     Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts,
    #     specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format
    #     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key>`.
    #     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through
    #     outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region
    #     `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
    #     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf`.
    #     The value must be URL-encoded.
    #
    #   To copy a specific version of an object, append
    #   `?versionId=<version-id>` to the value (for example,
    #   `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893`).
    #   If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest
    #   version of the source object.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] replication_status
    #   Amazon S3 can return this header if your request involves a bucket
    #   that is either a source or a destination in a replication rule.
    #
    #   In replication, you have a source bucket on which you configure
    #   replication and destination bucket or buckets where Amazon S3 stores
    #   object replicas. When you request an object (`GetObject`) or object
    #   metadata (`HeadObject`) from these buckets, Amazon S3 will return
    #   the `x-amz-replication-status` header in the response as follows:
    #
    #   * **If requesting an object from the source bucket**, Amazon S3 will
    #     return the `x-amz-replication-status` header if the object in your
    #     request is eligible for replication.
    #
    #     For example, suppose that in your replication configuration, you
    #     specify object prefix `TaxDocs` requesting Amazon S3 to replicate
    #     objects with key prefix `TaxDocs`. Any objects you upload with
    #     this key name prefix, for example `TaxDocs/document1.pdf`, are
    #     eligible for replication. For any object request with this key
    #     name prefix, Amazon S3 will return the `x-amz-replication-status`
    #     header with value PENDING, COMPLETED or FAILED indicating object
    #     replication status.
    #
    #   * **If requesting an object from a destination bucket**, Amazon S3
    #     will return the `x-amz-replication-status` header with value
    #     REPLICA if the object in your request is a replica that Amazon S3
    #     created and there is no replica modification replication in
    #     progress.
    #
    #   * **When replicating objects to multiple destination buckets**, the
    #     `x-amz-replication-status` header acts differently. The header of
    #     the source object will only return a value of COMPLETED when
    #     replication is successful to all destinations. The header will
    #     remain at value PENDING until replication has completed for all
    #     destinations. If one or more destinations fails replication the
    #     header will return FAILED.
    #
    #   For more information, see [Replication][1].

    #   described below:

    #   * Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation,
    #     or through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, and are
    #     encrypted by SSE-S3 or plaintext, have ETags that are an MD5
    #     digest of their object data.

    #     encrypted by SSE-C or SSE-KMS, have ETags that are not an MD5
    #     digest of their object data.
    #
    #   * If an object is created by either the Multipart Upload or Part
    #     Copy operation, the ETag is not an MD5 digest, regardless of the
    #     method of encryption. If an object is larger than 16 MB, the
    #     Amazon Web Services Management Console will upload or copy that
    #     object as a Multipart Upload, and therefore the ETag will not be
    #     an MD5 digest.

    #   metadata. For information about object metadata, see [Object Key and
    #   Metadata][1].
    #
    #   In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an
    #   object (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket:
    #
    #   `x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html`
    #
    #   In the following example, the request header sets the object
    #   redirect to another website:

    #   Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
    #   encryption with server-side encryption using Key Management Service
    #   (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS). Setting this header to `true` causes Amazon S3
    #   to use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with SSE-KMS.

    #   When using this action with an access point, you must direct
    #   requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname
    #   takes the form
    #   *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com.
    #   When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web

    #   [Using access points][1] in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    #
    #   When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct
    #   requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname
    #   takes the form `
    #   AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`.

    # @!attribute [rw] copy_source
    #   Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the
    #   value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access
    #   the source object through an [access point][1]:
    #
    #   * For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name
    #     of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a
    #     slash (/). For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf`
    #     from the bucket `awsexamplebucket`, use
    #     `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf`. The value must be
    #     URL-encoded.
    #
    #   * For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon
    #     Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access
    #     point, in the format
    #     `arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key>`.
    #     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through
    #     access point `my-access-point` owned by account `123456789012` in
    #     Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
    #     `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf`.
    #     The value must be URL encoded.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when
    #     the source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web
    #     Services Region.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #     Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts,
    #     specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format
    #     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key>`.
    #     For example, to copy the object `reports/january.pdf` through
    #     outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region
    #     `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of
    #     `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf`.
    #     The value must be URL-encoded.
    #
    #   To copy a specific version of an object, append
    #   `?versionId=<version-id>` to the value (for example,
    #   `awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893`).
    #   If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest
    #   version of the source object.
