    # @deprecated Use [Aws::S3::Client] #wait_until instead
    #
    # Waiter polls an API operation until a resource enters a desired
    # state.
    #
    # @note The waiting operation is performed on a copy. The original resource
    #   remains unchanged.
    #
    # ## Basic Usage
    #
    # Waiter will polls until it is successful, it fails by
    # entering a terminal state, or until a maximum number of attempts
    # are made.
    #
    #     # polls in a loop until condition is true
    #     resource.wait_until(options) {|resource| condition}
    #
    # ## Example
    #
    #     instance.wait_until(max_attempts:10, delay:5) do |instance|
    #       instance.state.name == 'running'
    #     end
    #
    # ## Configuration
    #
    # You can configure the maximum number of polling attempts, and the
    # delay (in seconds) between each polling attempt. The waiting condition is
    # set by passing a block to {#wait_until}:
    #
    #     # poll for ~25 seconds
    #     resource.wait_until(max_attempts:5,delay:5) {|resource|...}
    #
    # ## Callbacks
    #
    # You can be notified before each polling attempt and before each
    # delay. If you throw `:success` or `:failure` from these callbacks,
    # it will terminate the waiter.
    #
    #     started_at = Time.now
    #     # poll for 1 hour, instead of a number of attempts
    #     proc = Proc.new do |attempts, response|
    #       throw :failure if Time.now - started_at > 3600
    #     end
    #
    #       # disable max attempts
    #     instance.wait_until(before_wait:proc, max_attempts:nil) {...}
    #
    # ## Handling Errors
    #
    # When a waiter is successful, it returns the Resource. When a waiter
    # fails, it raises an error.
    #
    #     begin
    #       resource.wait_until(...)
    #     rescue Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed
    #       # resource did not enter the desired state in time
    #     end
    #
    # @yieldparam [Resource] resource to be used in the waiting condition.
    #
    # @raise [Aws::Waiters::Errors::FailureStateError] Raised when the waiter
    #   terminates because the waiter has entered a state that it will not
    #   transition out of, preventing success.
    #
    #   yet successful.
    #

    # @option options [String] :server_side_encryption
    #   The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in

    # @option options [String] :storage_class
    #   By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
    #   created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability
    #   and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify
    #   a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the
    #   OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see [Storage Classes][1]

    # @option options [String] :website_redirect_location
    #   If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this

    #   Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata. For
    #   information about object metadata, see [Object Key and Metadata][1].
    #
    #   In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an
    #   object (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket:
    #
    #   `x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html`
    #
    #   In the following example, the request header sets the object redirect
    #   to another website:
    #
    #   `x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/`

    # @option options [String] :sse_customer_algorithm
    #   Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for

    # @option options [String] :sse_customer_key
    #   Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
    #   encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
    #   discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must
    #   be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
    #   `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header.
    # @option options [String] :sse_customer_key_md5
    #   Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to
    #   RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to
    #   ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.
    # @option options [String] :ssekms_key_id
    #   If `x-amz-server-side-encryption` is present and has the value of
    #   `aws:kms`, this header specifies the ID of the Amazon Web Services Key
    #   Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) symmetrical customer
    #   managed key that was used for the object. If you specify
    #   `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`, but do not provide`
    #   x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, Amazon S3 uses the
    #   Amazon Web Services managed key to protect the data. If the KMS key
    #   does not exist in the same account issuing the command, you must use
    #   the full ARN and not just the ID.
    # @option options [String] :ssekms_encryption_context
    #   Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context to use for
    #   object encryption. The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8
    #   string holding JSON with the encryption context key-value pairs.
    # @option options [Boolean] :bucket_key_enabled
    #   Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
    #   encryption with server-side encryption using AWS KMS (SSE-KMS).
    #   Setting this header to `true` causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key
    #   for object encryption with SSE-KMS.
    #
    #   Specifying this header with a PUT action doesn’t affect bucket-level
    #   settings for S3 Bucket Key.
    # @option options [String] :request_payer
    #   Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the
