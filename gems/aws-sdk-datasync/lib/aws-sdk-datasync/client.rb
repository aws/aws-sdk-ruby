    # @overload initialize(options)
    #   @param [Hash] options
    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading static credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleWebIdentityCredentials` - Used when you need to
    #       assume a role after providing credentials via the web.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SSOCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from AWS SSO using an
    #       access token generated from `aws login`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ProcessCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       process that outputs to stdout.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ECSCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from
    #       instances running in ECS.
    #
    #     * `Aws::CognitoIdentityCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from the Cognito Identity service.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2/ECS IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts
    #       are very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #       `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` or `Aws::ECSCredentials` to
    #       enable retries and extended timeouts. Instance profile credential
    #       fetching can be disabled by setting ENV['AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED']
    #       to true.

    #   @option options [Integer] :max_attempts (3)
    #     An integer representing the maximum number attempts that will be made for
    #     a single request, including the initial attempt.  For example,
    #     setting this value to 5 will result in a request being retried up to
    #     4 times. Used in `standard` and `adaptive` retry modes.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :profile ("default")
    #     Used when loading credentials from the shared credentials file
    #     at HOME/.aws/credentials.  When not specified, 'default' is used.
    #
    #   @option options [Proc] :retry_backoff
    #     A proc or lambda used for backoff. Defaults to 2**retries * retry_base_delay.

    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_limit (3)
    #     The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #     ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #     are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #     checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors, auth errors,
    #     endpoint discovery, and errors from expired credentials.
    #     This option is only used in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_max_delay (0)
    #     The maximum number of seconds to delay between retries (0 for no limit)

    #     Specifies which retry algorithm to use. Values are:
    #
    #     * `legacy` - The pre-existing retry behavior.  This is default value if
    #       no retry mode is provided.
    #
    #     * `standard` - A standardized set of retry rules across the AWS SDKs.
    #       This includes support for retry quotas, which limit the number of
    #       unsuccessful retries a client can make.
    #
    #     * `adaptive` - An experimental retry mode that includes all the
    #       functionality of `standard` mode along with automatic client side
    #       throttling.  This is a provisional mode that may change behavior
    #       in the future.
    #
    #
    #   @option options [String] :secret_access_key
    #
    #   @option options [String] :session_token
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :simple_json (false)
    #     Disables request parameter conversion, validation, and formatting.
    #     Also disable response data type conversions. This option is useful
    #     when you want to ensure the highest level of performance by
    #     avoiding overhead of walking request parameters and response data
    #     structures.
    #
    #     When `:simple_json` is enabled, the request parameters hash must
    #     be formatted exactly as the DynamoDB API expects.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #     Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #     fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #     the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #     {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #     ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #     requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :use_dualstack_endpoint
    #     When set to `true`, dualstack enabled endpoints (with `.aws` TLD)
    #     will be used if available.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :use_fips_endpoint
    #     When set to `true`, fips compatible endpoints will be used if available.
    #     When a `fips` region is used, the region is normalized and this config
    #     is set to `true`.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #     When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #     sending the request.
    #
    #   @option options [URI::HTTP,String] :http_proxy A proxy to send
    #     requests through.  Formatted like 'http://proxy.com:123'.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_open_timeout (15) The number of
    #     seconds to wait when opening a HTTP session before raising a
    #     `Timeout::Error`.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_read_timeout (60) The default
    #     number of seconds to wait for response data.  This value can
    #     safely be set per-request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_idle_timeout (5) The number of
    #     seconds a connection is allowed to sit idle before it is
    #     considered stale.  Stale connections are closed and removed
    #     from the pool before making a request.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_continue_timeout (1) The number of
    #     seconds to wait for a 100-continue response before sending the
    #     request body.  This option has no effect unless the request has
    #     "Expect" header set to "100-continue".  Defaults to `nil` which
    #     disables this behaviour.  This value can safely be set per
    #     request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :ssl_timeout (nil) Sets the SSL timeout
    #     in seconds.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :http_wire_trace (false) When `true`,
    #     HTTP debug output will be sent to the `:logger`.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :ssl_verify_peer (true) When `true`,
    #     SSL peer certificates are verified when establishing a
    #     connection.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_bundle Full path to the SSL
    #     certificate authority bundle file that should be used when
    #     verifying peer certificates.  If you do not pass

    #     will be used if available.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_directory Full path of the
    #     directory that contains the unbundled SSL certificate
    #     authority files for verifying peer certificates.  If you do
    #     not pass `:ssl_ca_bundle` or `:ssl_ca_directory` the the

    #
    #   The exact relationship between security group M (of the mount target)
    #   and security group S (which you provide for DataSync to use at this
    #   stage) is as follows:
    #
    #   * Security group M (which you associate with the mount target) must
    #     allow inbound access for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) on
    #     the NFS port (2049) from security group S. You can enable inbound
    #     connections either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group.
    #
    #   * Security group S (provided to DataSync to access EFS) should have a
    #     rule that enables outbound connections to the NFS port on one of the
    #     file system’s mount targets. You can enable outbound connections
    #     either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group.

    # Defines a file system on a Network File System (NFS) server that can

    #
    # @option params [required, String] :subdirectory
    #   The subdirectory in the NFS file system that is used to read data from
    #   the NFS source location or write data to the NFS destination. The NFS
    #   path should be a path that's exported by the NFS server, or a
    #   subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can be
    #   mounted by other NFS clients in your network.
    #
    #   To see all the paths exported by your NFS server, run "`showmount -e
    #   nfs-server-name`" from an NFS client that has access to your server.
    #   You can specify any directory that appears in the results, and any
    #   subdirectory of that directory. Ensure that the NFS export is
    #   accessible without Kerberos authentication.
    #
    #   To transfer all the data in the folder you specified, DataSync needs
    #   to have permissions to read all the data. To ensure this, either
    #   configure the NFS export with `no_root_squash,` or ensure that the
    #   permissions for all of the files that you want DataSync allow read
    #   access for all users. Doing either enables the agent to read the
    #   files. For the agent to access directories, you must additionally
    #   enable all execute access.

    # Defines a file system on a Server Message Block (SMB) server that can
    # be read from or written to.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :subdirectory
    #   The subdirectory in the SMB file system that is used to read data from
    #   the SMB source location or write data to the SMB destination. The SMB
    #   path should be a path that's exported by the SMB server, or a
    #   subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can be
    #   mounted by other SMB clients in your network.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> `Subdirectory` must be specified with forward slashes. For example,
    #   `/path/to/folder`.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   To transfer all the data in the folder you specified, DataSync needs
    #   to have permissions to mount the SMB share, as well as to access all
    #   the data in that share. To ensure this, either ensure that the
    #   user/password specified belongs to the user who can mount the share,
    #   and who has the appropriate permissions for all of the files and
    #   directories that you want DataSync to access, or use credentials of a
    #   member of the Backup Operators group to mount the share. Doing either
    #   enables the agent to access the data. For the agent to access
    #   directories, you must additionally enable all execute access.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :server_hostname
    #   The name of the SMB server. This value is the IP address or Domain
    #   Name Service (DNS) name of the SMB server. An agent that is installed
    #   on-premises uses this hostname to mount the SMB server in a network.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> This name must either be DNS-compliant or must be an IP version 4
    #   (IPv4) address.

    # Creates a task.
    #
    # A task includes a source location and a destination location, and a
    # configuration that specifies how data is transferred. A task always
    # transfers data from the source location to the destination location.
    # The configuration specifies options such as task scheduling, bandwidth
    # limits, etc. A task is the complete definition of a data transfer.
    #
    # When you create a task that transfers data between Amazon Web Services
    # services in different Amazon Web Services Regions, one of the two
    # locations that you specify must reside in the Region where DataSync is
    # being used. The other location must be specified in a different
    # Region.
    #
    # You can transfer data between commercial Amazon Web Services Regions
    # except for China, or between Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US)
    # Regions.
    #
    # When you use DataSync to copy files or objects between Amazon Web
    # Services Regions, you pay for data transfer between Regions. This is
    # billed as data transfer OUT from your source Region to your
    # destination Region. For more information, see [Data Transfer

    #   subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can be
    #   mounted by other NFS clients in your network.
    #
    #   To see all the paths exported by your NFS server, run "`showmount -e
    #   nfs-server-name`" from an NFS client that has access to your server.
    #   You can specify any directory that appears in the results, and any
    #   subdirectory of that directory. Ensure that the NFS export is
    #   accessible without Kerberos authentication.
    #
    #   To transfer all the data in the folder that you specified, DataSync
    #   must have permissions to read all the data. To ensure this, either
    #   configure the NFS export with `no_root_squash`, or ensure that the
    #   files you want DataSync to access have permissions that allow read
    #   access for all users. Doing either option enables the agent to read
    #   the files. For the agent to access directories, you must additionally
