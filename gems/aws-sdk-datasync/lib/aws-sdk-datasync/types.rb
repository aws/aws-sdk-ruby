    #
    #   The exact relationship between security group M (of the mount
    #   target) and security group S (which you provide for DataSync to use
    #   at this stage) is as follows:
    #
    #   * Security group M (which you associate with the mount target) must
    #     allow inbound access for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
    #     on the NFS port (2049) from security group S. You can enable
    #     inbound connections either by IP address (CIDR range) or security
    #     group.
    #
    #   * Security group S (provided to DataSync to access EFS) should have
    #     a rule that enables outbound connections to the NFS port on one of
    #     the file system’s mount targets. You can enable outbound
    #     connections either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group.
