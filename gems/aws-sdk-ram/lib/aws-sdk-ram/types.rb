    #   @return [Boolean]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] client_token
    #   Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to
    #   ensure the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry
    #   the request without accidentally performing the same operation a
    #   second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation
    #   requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters.
    #   We recommend that you use a [UUID type of value.][1].
    #
    #   If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates
    #   a random one for you.
