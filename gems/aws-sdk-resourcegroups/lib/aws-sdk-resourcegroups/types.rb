    #   specifies only that resource type, but your `resource-type` filter
    #   includes EC2 instances, AWS Resource Groups does not filter for EC2
    #   instances. In this case, a `ListGroupResources` request returns a

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] query
    #   The query that defines a group or a search. The contents depends on
    #   the value of the `Type` element.
    #
    #   * `ResourceTypeFilters` – Applies to all `ResourceQuery` objects of
    #     either `Type`. This element contains one of the following two
    #     items:
    #
    #     * The value `AWS::AllSupported`. This causes the ResourceQuery to
    #       match resources of any resource type that also match the query.
    #
    #     * A list (a JSON array) of resource type identifiers that limit
    #       the query to only resources of the specified types. For the
    #       complete list of resource types that you can use in the array
    #       value for `ResourceTypeFilters`, see [Resources you can use with
    #       Resource Groups and Tag Editor][1] in the *Resource Groups User
    #       Guide*.
    #
    #     Example: `"ResourceTypeFilters": ["AWS::AllSupported"]` or
    #     `"ResourceTypeFilters": ["AWS::EC2::Instance", "AWS::S3::Bucket"]`
    #
    #   * `TagFilters` – applicable only if `Type` = `TAG_FILTERS_1_0`. The
    #     `Query` contains a JSON string that represents a collection of
    #     simple tag filters. The JSON string uses a syntax similar to the `
    #     GetResources ` operation, but uses only the `  ResourceTypeFilters
    #     ` and ` TagFilters ` fields. If you specify more than one tag key,
    #     only resources that match all tag keys, and at least one value of
    #     each specified tag key, are returned in your query. If you specify
    #     more than one value for a tag key, a resource matches the filter
    #     if it has a tag key value that matches *any* of the specified
    #     values.
    #
    #     For example, consider the following sample query for resources
    #     that have two tags, `Stage` and `Version`, with two values each:
    #
    #     `[\{"Stage":["Test","Deploy"]\},\{"Version":["1","2"]\}]`
    #
    #     The results of this resource query could include the following.
    #
    #     * An Amazon EC2 instance that has the following two tags:
    #       `\{"Stage":"Deploy"\}`, and `\{"Version":"2"\}`
    #
    #     * An S3 bucket that has the following two tags:
    #       `\{"Stage":"Test"\}`, and `\{"Version":"1"\}`
    #
    #     The resource query results would *not* include the following items
    #     in the results, however.
    #
    #     * An Amazon EC2 instance that has only the following tag:
    #       `\{"Stage":"Deploy"\}`.
    #
    #       The instance does not have **all** of the tag keys specified in
    #       the filter, so it is excluded from the results.
    #
    #     * An RDS database that has the following two tags:
    #       `\{"Stage":"Archived"\}` and `\{"Version":"4"\}`
    #
    #       The database has all of the tag keys, but none of those keys has
    #       an associated value that matches at least one of the specified
    #       values in the filter.
    #
    #     Example: `"TagFilters": [ \{ "Key": "Stage", "Values": [ "Gamma",
    #     "Beta" ] \}`
    #
    #   * `StackIdentifier` – applicable only if `Type` =
    #     `CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0`. The value of this parameter is the
    #     Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudFormation stack whose
    #     resources you want included in the group.
