    #   non-default KMS key. If this parameter is not specified, the default
    #   KMS key for Amazon EFS is used. You can specify a KMS key ID using
    #   the following formats:
    #
    #   * Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for example
    #     `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
    #
    #   * ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key, for example
    #     `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
    #
    #   * Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for
    #     example `alias/projectKey1`.
    #
    #   * Key alias ARN - An ARN for a key alias, for example
    #     `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1`.
    #
    #   If you use `KmsKeyId`, you must set the

    #   keys with Amazon EFS file systems.

    # @!attribute [rw] throughput_mode
    #   Specifies the throughput mode for the file system, either `bursting`

    #   must also set a value for `ProvisionedThroughputInMibps`. After you
    #   create the file system, you can decrease your file system's
    #   throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode or change between the
