    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] performance_mode
    #   The performance mode of the file system. We recommend
    #   `generalPurpose` performance mode for most file systems. File
    #   systems using the `maxIO` performance mode can scale to higher
    #   levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a
    #   tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The
    #   performance mode can't be changed after the file system has been
    #   created.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] encrypted
    #   A Boolean value that, if true, creates an encrypted file system.
    #   When creating an encrypted file system, you have the option of
    #   specifying CreateFileSystemRequest$KmsKeyId for an existing AWS Key
    #   Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK). If you
    #   don't specify a CMK, then the default CMK for Amazon EFS,
    #   `/aws/elasticfilesystem`, is used to protect the encrypted file
    #   system.
    #   @return [Boolean]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] kms_key_id
    #   The ID of the AWS KMS CMK to be used to protect the encrypted file
    #   system. This parameter is only required if you want to use a
    #   nondefault CMK. If this parameter is not specified, the default CMK
    #   for Amazon EFS is used. This ID can be in one of the following
    #   formats:
    #
    #   * Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for example
    #     `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
    #
    #   * ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key, for example
    #     `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
    #
    #   * Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for
    #     example `alias/projectKey1`.
    #
    #   * Key alias ARN - An ARN for a key alias, for example
    #     `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1`.
    #
    #   If `KmsKeyId` is specified, the CreateFileSystemRequest$Encrypted
    #   parameter must be set to true.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] throughput_mode
    #   The throughput mode for the file system to be created. There are two
    #   throughput modes to choose from for your file system: `bursting` and
    #   `provisioned`. If you set `ThroughputMode` to `provisioned`, you
    #   must also set a value for `ProvisionedThroughPutInMibps`. You can
    #   decrease your file system's throughput in Provisioned Throughput
    #   mode or change between the throughput modes as long as itâ€™s been
    #   more than 24 hours since the last decrease or throughput mode
    #   change. For more, see [Specifying Throughput with Provisioned
    #   Mode][1] in the *Amazon EFS User Guide.*

    #   The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for a
    #   file system that you're creating. Valid values are 1-1024. Required
    #   if `ThroughputMode` is set to `provisioned`. The upper limit for
    #   throughput is 1024 MiB/s. You can get this limit increased by
    #   contacting AWS Support. For more information, see [Amazon EFS Limits
