    #   mode can't be changed after the file system has been created. The
    #   `maxIO` mode is not supported on One Zone file systems.

    #   KMS key for Amazon EFS is used. You can specify a KMS key ID using
    #   the following formats:
    #
    #   * Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for example
    #     `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
    #
    #   * ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key, for example
    #     `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
    #
    #   * Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for
    #     example `alias/projectKey1`.
    #
    #   * Key alias ARN - An ARN for a key alias, for example
    #     `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1`.
    #
    #   If you use `KmsKeyId`, you must set the
    #   CreateFileSystemRequest$Encrypted parameter to true.

    #   keys with Amazon EFS file systems.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] throughput_mode
    #   Specifies the throughput mode for the file system. The mode can be
    #   `bursting`, `provisioned`, or `elastic`. If you set `ThroughputMode`
    #   to `provisioned`, you must also set a value for
    #   `ProvisionedThroughputInMibps`. After you create the file system,
    #   you can decrease your file system's Provisioned throughput or
    #   change between the throughput modes, with certain time restrictions.
    #   For more information, see [Specifying throughput with provisioned
    #   mode][1] in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*.
