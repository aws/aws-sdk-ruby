    #   String of up to 64 ASCII characters. Amazon EFS uses this to ensure
    #   idempotent creation.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] performance_mode
    #   The `PerformanceMode` of the file system. We recommend
    #   `generalPurpose` performance mode for most file systems. File
    #   systems using the `maxIO` performance mode can scale to higher
    #   levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a
    #   tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations. This
    #   can't be changed after the file system has been created.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] encrypted
    #   A boolean value that, if true, creates an encrypted file system.
    #   When creating an encrypted file system, you have the option of
    #   specifying a CreateFileSystemRequest$KmsKeyId for an existing AWS
    #   Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK). If you
    #   don't specify a CMK, then the default CMK for Amazon EFS,
    #   `/aws/elasticfilesystem`, is used to protect the encrypted file
    #   system.
    #   @return [Boolean]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] kms_key_id
    #   The id of the AWS KMS CMK that will be used to protect the encrypted
    #   file system. This parameter is only required if you want to use a
    #   non-default CMK. If this parameter is not specified, the default CMK
    #   for Amazon EFS is used. This id can be in one of the following
    #   formats:
    #
    #   * Key ID - A unique identifier of the key. For example,
    #     `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
    #
    #   * ARN - An Amazon Resource Name for the key. For example,
    #     `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.
    #
    #   * Key alias - A previously created display name for a key. For
    #     example, `alias/projectKey1`.
    #
    #   * Key alias ARN - An Amazon Resource Name for a key alias. For
    #     example, `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1`.
    #
    #   Note that if the KmsKeyId is specified, the
    #   CreateFileSystemRequest$Encrypted parameter must be set to true.
