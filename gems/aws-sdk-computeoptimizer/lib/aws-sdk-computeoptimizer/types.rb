    # @!attribute [rw] platform_differences
    #   Describes the configuration differences between the current instance
    #   and the recommended instance type. You should consider the
    #   configuration differences before migrating your workloads from the
    #   current instance to the recommended instance type. The [Change the
    #   instance type guide for Linux][1] and [Change the instance type
    #   guide for Windows][2] provide general guidance for getting started
    #   with an instance migration.
    #
    #   Platform differences include:
    #
    #   * <b> <code>Hypervisor</code> </b> — The hypervisor of the
    #     recommended instance type is different than that of the current
    #     instance. For example, the recommended instance type uses a Nitro
    #     hypervisor and the current instance uses a Xen hypervisor. The
    #     differences that you should consider between these hypervisors are
    #     covered in the [Nitro Hypervisor][3] section of the Amazon EC2
    #     frequently asked questions. For more information, see [Instances
    #     built on the Nitro System][4] in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for
    #     Linux*, or [Instances built on the Nitro System][5] in the *Amazon
    #     EC2 User Guide for Windows*.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>NetworkInterface</code> </b> — The network interface of
    #     the recommended instance type is different than that of the
    #     current instance. For example, the recommended instance type
    #     supports enhanced networking and the current instance might not.
    #     To enable enhanced networking for the recommended instance type,
    #     you must install the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) driver or the
    #     Intel 82599 Virtual Function driver. For more information, see
    #     [Networking and storage features][6] and [Enhanced networking on
    #     Linux][7] in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux*, or [Networking
    #     and storage features][8] and [Enhanced networking on Windows][9]
    #     in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows*.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>StorageInterface</code> </b> — The storage interface of
    #     the recommended instance type is different than that of the
    #     current instance. For example, the recommended instance type uses
    #     an NVMe storage interface and the current instance does not. To
    #     access NVMe volumes for the recommended instance type, you will
    #     need to install or upgrade the NVMe driver. For more information,
    #     see [Networking and storage features][6] and [Amazon EBS and NVMe
    #     on Linux instances][10] in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux*,
    #     or [Networking and storage features][8] and [Amazon EBS and NVMe
    #     on Windows instances][11] in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for
    #     Windows*.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>InstanceStoreAvailability</code> </b> — The recommended
    #     instance type does not support instance store volumes and the
    #     current instance does. Before migrating, you might need to back up
    #     the data on your instance store volumes if you want to preserve
    #     them. For more information, see [How do I back up an instance
    #     store volume on my Amazon EC2 instance to Amazon EBS?][12] in the
    #     *Amazon Web Services Premium Support Knowledge Base*. For more
    #     information, see [Networking and storage features][6] and [Amazon
    #     EC2 instance store][13] in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux*,
    #     or see [Networking and storage features][8] and [Amazon EC2
    #     instance store][14] in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows*.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>VirtualizationType</code> </b> — The recommended
    #     instance type uses the hardware virtual machine (HVM)
    #     virtualization type and the current instance uses the paravirtual
    #     (PV) virtualization type. For more information about the
    #     differences between these virtualization types, see [Linux AMI
    #     virtualization types][15] in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for
    #     Linux*, or [Windows AMI virtualization types][16] in the *Amazon
    #     EC2 User Guide for Windows*.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>Architecture</code> </b> — The CPU architecture between
    #     the recommended instance type and the current instance is
    #     different. For example, the recommended instance type might use an
    #     Arm CPU architecture and the current instance type might use a
    #     different one, such as x86. Before migrating, you should consider
    #     recompiling the software on your instance for the new
    #     architecture. Alternatively, you might switch to an Amazon Machine
    #     Image (AMI) that supports the new architecture. For more
    #     information about the CPU architecture for each instance type, see
    #     [Amazon EC2 Instance Types][17].

    #     a higher level (over-provisioned) or at a lower level
    #     (under-provisioned) than required for your workload because its
    #     current configuration is not optimal. Over-provisioned resources

    #     performance. This finding classification can include the

    #     reason codes.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>Unavailable</code> </b> — Compute Optimizer was unable

    #     because the function has not accumulated sufficient metric data,
    #     or the function does not qualify for a recommendation. This

    #     An over-provisioned function might lead to unnecessary
    #     infrastructure cost. This finding reason code is part of the

    #     have sufficient metric data for Compute Optimizer to generate a
    #     recommendation. For more information, see the [Supported resources
