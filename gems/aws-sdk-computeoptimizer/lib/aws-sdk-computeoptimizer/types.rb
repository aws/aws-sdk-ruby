    # @!attribute [rw] platform_differences
    #   Describes the configuration differences between the current instance
    #   and the recommended instance type. You should consider the
    #   configuration differences before migrating your workloads from the
    #   current instance to the recommended instance type. The [Change the
    #   instance type guide for Linux][1] and [Change the instance type
    #   guide for Windows][2] provide general guidance for getting started
    #   with an instance migration.
    #
    #   Platform differences include:
    #
    #   * <b> <code>Hypervisor</code> </b> — The hypervisor of the
    #     recommended instance type is different than that of the current
    #     instance. For example, the recommended instance type uses a Nitro
    #     hypervisor and the current instance uses a Xen hypervisor. The
    #     differences that you should consider between these hypervisors are
    #     covered in the [Nitro Hypervisor][3] section of the Amazon EC2
    #     frequently asked questions. For more information, see [Instances
    #     built on the Nitro System][4] in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for
    #     Linux*, or [Instances built on the Nitro System][5] in the *Amazon
    #     EC2 User Guide for Windows*.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>NetworkInterface</code> </b> — The network interface of
    #     the recommended instance type is different than that of the
    #     current instance. For example, the recommended instance type
    #     supports enhanced networking and the current instance might not.
    #     To enable enhanced networking for the recommended instance type,
    #     you must install the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) driver or the
    #     Intel 82599 Virtual Function driver. For more information, see
    #     [Networking and storage features][6] and [Enhanced networking on
    #     Linux][7] in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux*, or [Networking
    #     and storage features][8] and [Enhanced networking on Windows][9]
    #     in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows*.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>StorageInterface</code> </b> — The storage interface of
    #     the recommended instance type is different than that of the
    #     current instance. For example, the recommended instance type uses
    #     an NVMe storage interface and the current instance does not. To
    #     access NVMe volumes for the recommended instance type, you will
    #     need to install or upgrade the NVMe driver. For more information,
    #     see [Networking and storage features][6] and [Amazon EBS and NVMe
    #     on Linux instances][10] in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux*,
    #     or [Networking and storage features][8] and [Amazon EBS and NVMe
    #     on Windows instances][11] in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for
    #     Windows*.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>InstanceStoreAvailability</code> </b> — The recommended
    #     instance type does not support instance store volumes and the
    #     current instance does. Before migrating, you might need to back up
    #     the data on your instance store volumes if you want to preserve
    #     them. For more information, see [How do I back up an instance
    #     store volume on my Amazon EC2 instance to Amazon EBS?][12] in the
    #     *Amazon Web Services Premium Support Knowledge Base*. For more
    #     information, see [Networking and storage features][6] and [Amazon
    #     EC2 instance store][13] in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux*,
    #     or see [Networking and storage features][8] and [Amazon EC2
    #     instance store][14] in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows*.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>VirtualizationType</code> </b> — The recommended
    #     instance type uses the hardware virtual machine (HVM)
    #     virtualization type and the current instance uses the paravirtual
    #     (PV) virtualization type. For more information about the
    #     differences between these virtualization types, see [Linux AMI
    #     virtualization types][15] in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for
    #     Linux*, or [Windows AMI virtualization types][16] in the *Amazon
    #     EC2 User Guide for Windows*.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>Architecture</code> </b> — The CPU architecture between
    #     the recommended instance type and the current instance is
    #     different. For example, the recommended instance type might use an
    #     Arm CPU architecture and the current instance type might use a
    #     different one, such as x86. Before migrating, you should consider
    #     recompiling the software on your instance for the new
    #     architecture. Alternatively, you might switch to an Amazon Machine
    #     Image (AMI) that supports the new architecture. For more
    #     information about the CPU architecture for each instance type, see
    #     [Amazon EC2 Instance Types][17].

    #     configuration and its utilization history. This finding
    #     classification does not include finding reason codes.
    #

    #     a higher level (over-provisioned) or at a lower level
    #     (under-provisioned) than required for your workload because its
    #     current configuration is not optimal. Over-provisioned resources
    #     might lead to unnecessary infrastructure cost, and
    #     under-provisioned resources might lead to poor application
    #     performance. This finding classification can include the
    #     `MemoryUnderprovisioned` and `MemoryUnderprovisioned` finding
    #     reason codes.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>Unavailable</code> </b> — Compute Optimizer was unable
    #     to generate a recommendation for the function. This could be
    #     because the function has not accumulated sufficient metric data,
    #     or the function does not qualify for a recommendation. This

    #     while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload.
    #     An over-provisioned function might lead to unnecessary
    #     infrastructure cost. This finding reason code is part of the
    #     `NotOptimized` finding classification.

    #     under-provisioned when its memory configuration doesn't meet the
    #     performance requirements of the workload. An under-provisioned
    #     function might lead to poor application performance. This finding
    #     reason code is part of the `NotOptimized` finding classification.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>InsufficientData</code> </b> — The function does not
    #     have sufficient metric data for Compute Optimizer to generate a
    #     recommendation. For more information, see the [Supported resources
    #     and requirements][1] in the *Compute Optimizer User Guide*. This
    #     finding reason code is part of the `Unavailable` finding

    # projected utilization metric data to determine the performance
    # difference between your current resource and the recommended option.
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] name
    #   The name of the utilization metric.
    #
    #   The following utilization metrics are available:
    #
    #   * `Cpu` - The percentage of allocated EC2 compute units that are
    #     currently in use on the instance. This metric identifies the
    #     processing power required to run an application on the instance.
    #
    #     Depending on the instance type, tools in your operating system can
    #     show a lower percentage than CloudWatch when the instance is not
    #     allocated a full processor core.
    #
    #     Units: Percent
    #
    #   * `Memory` - The percentage of memory that is currently in use on
    #     the instance. This metric identifies the amount of memory required
    #     to run an application on the instance.
    #
    #     Units: Percent
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> The `Memory` metric is returned only for resources that have the
    #     unified CloudWatch agent installed on them. For more information,
    #     see [Enabling Memory Utilization with the CloudWatch Agent][1].
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   * `EBS_READ_OPS_PER_SECOND` - The completed read operations from all
    #     EBS volumes attached to the instance in a specified period of
    #     time.
    #
    #     Unit: Count
    #
    #   * `EBS_WRITE_OPS_PER_SECOND` - The completed write operations to all
    #     EBS volumes attached to the instance in a specified period of
    #     time.
    #
    #     Unit: Count
    #
    #   * `EBS_READ_BYTES_PER_SECOND` - The bytes read from all EBS volumes
    #     attached to the instance in a specified period of time.
    #
    #     Unit: Bytes
    #
    #   * `EBS_WRITE_BYTES_PER_SECOND` - The bytes written to all EBS
    #     volumes attached to the instance in a specified period of time.
    #
    #     Unit: Bytes
    #
    #   * `DISK_READ_OPS_PER_SECOND` - The completed read operations from
    #     all instance store volumes available to the instance in a
    #     specified period of time.
    #
    #     If there are no instance store volumes, either the value is `0` or
    #     the metric is not reported.
    #
    #   * `DISK_WRITE_OPS_PER_SECOND` - The completed write operations from
    #     all instance store volumes available to the instance in a
    #     specified period of time.
    #
    #     If there are no instance store volumes, either the value is `0` or
    #     the metric is not reported.
    #
    #   * `DISK_READ_BYTES_PER_SECOND` - The bytes read from all instance
    #     store volumes available to the instance. This metric is used to
    #     determine the volume of the data the application reads from the
    #     disk of the instance. This can be used to determine the speed of
    #     the application.
    #
    #     If there are no instance store volumes, either the value is `0` or
    #     the metric is not reported.
    #
    #   * `DISK_WRITE_BYTES_PER_SECOND` - The bytes written to all instance
    #     store volumes available to the instance. This metric is used to
