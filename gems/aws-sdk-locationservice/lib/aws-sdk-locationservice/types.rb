    # API Restrictions on the allowed actions, resources, and referers for
    # an API key resource.
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] allow_actions
    #   A list of allowed actions that an API key resource grants
    #   permissions to perform. You must have at least one action for each
    #   type of resource. For example, if you have a place resource, you
    #   must include at least one place action.
    #
    #   The following are valid values for the actions.
    #
    #   * **Map actions**
    #
    #     * `geo:GetMap*` - Allows all actions needed for map rendering.
    #
    #     ^
    #
    #   * **Place actions**
    #
    #     * `geo:SearchPlaceIndexForText` - Allows geocoding.
    #
    #     * `geo:SearchPlaceIndexForPosition` - Allows reverse geocoding.
    #
    #     * `geo:SearchPlaceIndexForSuggestions` - Allows generating
    #       suggestions from text.
    #
    #     * `GetPlace` - Allows finding a place by place ID.
    #
    #   * **Route actions**
    #
    #     * `geo:CalculateRoute` - Allows point to point routing.
    #
    #     * `geo:CalculateRouteMatrix` - Allows calculating a matrix of
    #       routes.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> You must use these strings exactly. For example, to provide access
    #   to map rendering, the only valid action is `geo:GetMap*` as an input
    #   to the list. `["geo:GetMap*"]` is valid but `["geo:GetMapTile"]` is
    #   not. Similarly, you cannot use `["geo:SearchPlaceIndexFor*"]` - you
    #   must list each of the Place actions separately.
    #

    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] allow_resources
    #   A list of allowed resource ARNs that a API key bearer can perform
    #   actions on.
    #
    #   * The ARN must be the correct ARN for a map, place, or route ARN.
    #     You may include wildcards in the resource-id to match multiple
    #     resources of the same type.
    #
    #   * The resources must be in the same `partition`, `region`, and
    #     `account-id` as the key that is being created.
    #
    #   * Other than wildcards, you must include the full ARN, including the
    #     `arn`, `partition`, `service`, `region`, `account-id` and
    #     `resource-id` delimited by colons (:).
    #
    #   * No spaces allowed, even with wildcards. For example,
    #     `arn:aws:geo:region:account-id:map/ExampleMap*`.

    #   not be allowed.
    #
    #   Requirements:
    #
    #   * Contain only alphanumeric characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9) or any
    #     symbols in this list `` $\-._+!*`(),;/?:@=& ``
    #
    #   * May contain a percent (%) if followed by 2 hexadecimal digits
    #     (A-F, a-f, 0-9); this is used for URL encoding purposes.
    #
    #   * May contain wildcard characters question mark (?) and asterisk
    #     (*).
    #
    #     Question mark (?) will replace any single character (including
    #     hexadecimal digits).
    #
    #     Asterisk (*) will replace any multiple characters (including

    #     ft), location updates are ignored. Location updates within this

    #     nor stored. This helps control costs by reducing the number of

    #     through. Distance-based filtering can also reduce the effects of
    #     GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map.
    #
    #   * `AccuracyBased` - If the device has moved less than the measured
    #     accuracy, location updates are ignored. For example, if two
    #     consecutive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5
    #     m and 10 m, the second update is ignored if the device has moved
    #     less than 15 m. Ignored location updates are neither evaluated
    #     against linked geofence collections, nor stored. This can reduce
    #     the effects of GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a
    #     map, and can help control your costs by reducing the number of

    #   the same (to form a closed boundary), is called a linear ring. The
    #   linear ring vertices must be listed in counter-clockwise order
    #   around the ring’s interior. The linear ring is represented as an
    #   array of vertices, or an array of arrays of doubles (`[[double,
    #   double], ...]`).
    #
    #   A geofence consists of a single linear ring. To allow for future
    #   expansion, the Polygon parameter takes an array of linear rings,
    #   which is represented as an array of arrays of arrays of doubles
    #   (`[[[double, double], ...], ...]`).
    #

    #
    #   If the data provider does not have a value for Greek, the result
    #   will be in a language that the provider does support.

    #     colors, labels, and features that's designed to draw attention to
    #     your thematic content.
    #
    #   * `RasterEsriImagery` – The Esri Imagery map style. A raster basemap
    #     that provides one meter or better satellite and aerial imagery in
    #     many parts of the world and lower resolution satellite imagery
    #     worldwide.

    #
    #   * `VectorEsriStreets` – The Esri Street Map style, which provides a
    #     detailed vector basemap for the world symbolized with a classic
    #     Esri street map style. The vector tile layer is similar in content
    #     and style to the World Street Map raster map.
    #
    #   * `VectorEsriNavigation` – The Esri Navigation map style, which
    #     provides a detailed basemap for the world symbolized with a custom

    #     rendering.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> The `VectorHereContrast` style has been renamed from
    #     `VectorHereBerlin`. `VectorHereBerlin` has been deprecated, but
    #     will continue to work in applications that use it.

    #      </note>
    #
    #   * `VectorHereExplore` – A default HERE map style containing a
    #     neutral, global map and its features including roads, buildings,
    #     landmarks, and water features. It also now includes a fully
    #     designed map of Japan.
    #
    #   * `VectorHereExploreTruck` – A global map containing truck
    #     restrictions and attributes (e.g. width / height / HAZMAT)
    #     symbolized with highlighted segments and icons on top of HERE
    #     Explore to support use cases within transport and logistics.
    #
    #   * `RasterHereExploreSatellite` – A global map containing high
    #     resolution satellite imagery.
    #
    #   * `HybridHereExploreSatellite` – A global map displaying the road
    #     network, street names, and city labels over satellite imagery.
    #     This style will automatically retrieve both raster and vector
    #     tiles, and your charges will be based on total tiles retrieved.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Hybrid styles use both vector and raster tiles when rendering the
    #     map that you see. This means that more tiles are retrieved than
    #     when using either vector or raster tiles alone. Your charges will
    #     include all tiles retrieved.

    #
    #   For example, `[-12.7935, -37.4835, -12.0684, -36.9542]` represents a

    #   This setting affects the languages used in the results. If no
    #   language is specified, or not supported for a particular result, the
    #   partner automatically chooses a language for the result.
    #
    #   For an example, we'll use the Greek language. You search for
    #   `Athens, Gr` to get suggestions with the `language` parameter set to
    #   `en`. The results found will most likely be returned as `Athens,
    #   Greece`.

    #
    #   If the data provider does not have a value for Greek, the result
    #   will be in a language that the provider does support.

    #     collections, nor stored. This helps control costs by reducing the

    #     accuracy, location updates are ignored. For example, if two
    #     consecutive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5
    #     m and 10 m, the second update is ignored if the device has moved
    #     less than 15 m. Ignored location updates are neither evaluated
