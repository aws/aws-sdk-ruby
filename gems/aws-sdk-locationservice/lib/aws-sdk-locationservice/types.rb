    # API Restrictions on the allowed actions, resources, and referers for
    # an API key resource.
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] allow_actions
    #   A list of allowed actions that an API key resource grants
    #   permissions to perform. You must have at least one action for each
    #   type of resource. For example, if you have a place resource, you
    #   must include at least one place action.
    #
    #   The following are valid values for the actions.
    #
    #   * **Map actions**
    #
    #     * `geo:GetMap*` - Allows all actions needed for map rendering.
    #
    #     ^
    #
    #   * **Place actions**
    #
    #     * `geo:SearchPlaceIndexForText` - Allows geocoding.
    #
    #     * `geo:SearchPlaceIndexForPosition` - Allows reverse geocoding.
    #
    #     * `geo:SearchPlaceIndexForSuggestions` - Allows generating
    #       suggestions from text.
    #
    #     * `GetPlace` - Allows finding a place by place ID.
    #
    #   * **Route actions**
    #
    #     * `geo:CalculateRoute` - Allows point to point routing.
    #
    #     * `geo:CalculateRouteMatrix` - Allows calculating a matrix of
    #       routes.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> You must use these strings exactly. For example, to provide access
    #   to map rendering, the only valid action is `geo:GetMap*` as an input
    #   to the list. `["geo:GetMap*"]` is valid but `["geo:GetMapTile"]` is
    #   not. Similarly, you cannot use `["geo:SearchPlaceIndexFor*"]` - you
    #   must list each of the Place actions separately.

    #   An optional list of allowed HTTP referers for which requests must
    #   originate from. Requests using this API key from other domains will
    #   not be allowed.
    #
    #   Requirements:
    #
    #   * Contain only alphanumeric characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9) or any
    #     symbols in this list `` $\-._+!*`(),;/?:@=& ``
    #
    #   * May contain a percent (%) if followed by 2 hexadecimal digits
    #     (A-F, a-f, 0-9); this is used for URL encoding purposes.
    #
    #   * May contain wildcard characters question mark (?) and asterisk
    #     (*).
    #
    #     Question mark (?) will replace any single character (including
    #     hexadecimal digits).
    #
    #     Asterisk (*) will replace any multiple characters (including
    #     multiple hexadecimal digits).
    #
    #   * No spaces allowed. For example, `https://example.com`.
    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] allow_resources
    #   A list of allowed resource ARNs that a API key bearer can perform
    #   actions on.
    #
    #   * The ARN must be the correct ARN for a map, place, or route ARN.
    #     You may include wildcards in the resource-id to match multiple
    #     resources of the same type.
    #
    #   * The resources must be in the same `partition`, `region`, and
    #     `account-id` as the key that is being created.
    #
    #   * Other than wildcards, you must include the full ARN, including the
    #     `arn`, `partition`, `service`, `region`, `account-id` and
    #     `resource-id` delimited by colons (:).
    #
    #   * No spaces allowed, even with wildcards. For example,

    #     update per 30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID.
    #
    #   * `DistanceBased` - If the device has moved less than 30 m (98.4
    #     ft), location updates are ignored. Location updates within this
    #     area are neither evaluated against linked geofence collections,
    #     nor stored. This helps control costs by reducing the number of
    #     geofence evaluations and historical device positions to paginate

    #     GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map.
    #
    #   * `AccuracyBased` - If the device has moved less than the measured
    #     accuracy, location updates are ignored. For example, if two
    #     consecutive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5
    #     m and 10 m, the second update is ignored if the device has moved
    #     less than 15 m. Ignored location updates are neither evaluated
    #     against linked geofence collections, nor stored. This can reduce

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] polygon
    #   A polygon is a list of linear rings which are each made up of a list
    #   of vertices.
    #
    #   Each vertex is a 2-dimensional point of the form: `[longitude,
    #   latitude]`. This is represented as an array of doubles of length 2
    #   (so `[double, double]`).
    #
    #   An array of 4 or more vertices, where the first and last vertex are
    #   the same (to form a closed boundary), is called a linear ring. The
    #   linear ring vertices must be listed in counter-clockwise order
    #   around the ring’s interior. The linear ring is represented as an
    #   array of vertices, or an array of arrays of doubles (`[[double,
    #   double], ...]`).
    #
    #   A geofence consists of a single linear ring. To allow for future
    #   expansion, the Polygon parameter takes an array of linear rings,
    #   which is represented as an array of arrays of arrays of doubles
    #   (`[[[double, double], ...], ...]`).
    #
    #   A linear ring for use in geofences can consist of between 4 and
    #   1,000 vertices.

    #
    #   This setting affects the languages used in the results, but not the
    #   results themselves. If no language is specified, or not supported
    #   for a particular result, the partner automatically chooses a
    #   language for the result.
    #
    #   For an example, we'll use the Greek language. You search for a
    #   location around Athens, Greece, with the `language` parameter set to
    #   `en`. The `city` in the results will most likely be returned as
    #   `Athens`.
    #
    #   If you set the `language` parameter to `el`, for Greek, then the
    #   `city` in the results will more likely be returned as `Αθήνα`.
    #
    #   If the data provider does not have a value for Greek, the result
    #   will be in a language that the provider does support.

    #   The identifier of the place to find.
    #
    #   While you can use PlaceID in subsequent requests, PlaceID is not
    #   intended to be a permanent identifier and the ID can change between
    #   consecutive API calls. Please see the following PlaceID behaviour
    #   for each data provider:
    #
    #   * Esri: Place IDs will change every quarter at a minimum. The
    #     typical time period for these changes would be March, June,
    #     September, and December. Place IDs might also change between the
    #     typical quarterly change but that will be much less frequent.
    #
    #   * HERE: We recommend that you cache data for no longer than a week
    #     to keep your data data fresh. You can assume that less than 1% ID
    #     shifts will release over release which is approximately 1 - 2
    #     times per week.
    #
    #   * Grab: Place IDs can expire or become invalid in the following
    #     situations.
    #
    #     * Data operations: The POI may be removed from Grab POI database
    #       by Grab Map Ops based on the ground-truth, such as being closed
    #       in the real world, being detected as a duplicate POI, or having
    #       incorrect information. Grab will synchronize data to the
    #       Waypoint environment on weekly basis.
    #
    #     * Interpolated POI: Interpolated POI is a temporary POI generated
    #       in real time when serving a request, and it will be marked as
    #       derived in the `place.result_type` field in the response. The
    #       information of interpolated POIs will be retained for at least
    #       30 days, which means that within 30 days, you are able to obtain
    #       POI details by Place ID from Place Details API. After 30 days,
    #       the interpolated POIs(both Place ID and details) may expire and
    #       inaccessible from the Places Details API.

    # @!attribute [rw] place_id
    #   The unique identifier of the Place. You can use this with the
    #   `GetPlace` operation to find the place again later, or to get full
    #   information for the Place.
    #
    #   The `GetPlace` request must use the same `PlaceIndex` resource as
    #   the `SearchPlaceIndexForSuggestions` that generated the Place ID.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> For `SearchPlaceIndexForSuggestions` operations, the `PlaceId` is
    #   returned by place indexes that use Esri, Grab, or HERE as data
    #   providers.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   While you can use PlaceID in subsequent requests, PlaceID is not
    #   intended to be a permanent identifier and the ID can change between
    #   consecutive API calls. Please see the following PlaceID behaviour
    #   for each data provider:
    #
    #   * Esri: Place IDs will change every quarter at a minimum. The
    #     typical time period for these changes would be March, June,
    #     September, and December. Place IDs might also change between the
    #     typical quarterly change but that will be much less frequent.
    #
    #   * HERE: We recommend that you cache data for no longer than a week
    #     to keep your data data fresh. You can assume that less than 1% ID
    #     shifts will release over release which is approximately 1 - 2
    #     times per week.
    #
    #   * Grab: Place IDs can expire or become invalid in the following
    #     situations.
    #
    #     * Data operations: The POI may be removed from Grab POI database
    #       by Grab Map Ops based on the ground-truth, such as being closed
    #       in the real world, being detected as a duplicate POI, or having
    #       incorrect information. Grab will synchronize data to the
    #       Waypoint environment on weekly basis.
    #
    #     * Interpolated POI: Interpolated POI is a temporary POI generated
    #       in real time when serving a request, and it will be marked as
    #       derived in the `place.result_type` field in the response. The
    #       information of interpolated POIs will be retained for at least
    #       30 days, which means that within 30 days, you are able to obtain
    #       POI details by Place ID from Place Details API. After 30 days,
    #       the interpolated POIs(both Place ID and details) may expire and
    #       inaccessible from the Places Details API.

    #   Valid values:
    #
    #   * `TimeBased` - Location updates are evaluated against linked
    #     geofence collections, but not every location update is stored. If
    #     your update frequency is more often than 30 seconds, only one
    #     update per 30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID.
    #
    #   * `DistanceBased` - If the device has moved less than 30 m (98.4
    #     ft), location updates are ignored. Location updates within this
    #     distance are neither evaluated against linked geofence
    #     collections, nor stored. This helps control costs by reducing the
    #     number of geofence evaluations and historical device positions to
    #     paginate through. Distance-based filtering can also reduce the
    #     effects of GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map.
    #
    #   * `AccuracyBased` - If the device has moved less than the measured
    #     accuracy, location updates are ignored. For example, if two
    #     consecutive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5
    #     m and 10 m, the second update is ignored if the device has moved
    #     less than 15 m. Ignored location updates are neither evaluated
    #     against linked geofence collections, nor stored. This helps educe
    #     the effects of GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a
    #     map, and can help control costs by reducing the number of geofence
    #     evaluations.
