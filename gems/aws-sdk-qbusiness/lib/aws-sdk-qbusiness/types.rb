    # @!attribute [rw] condition
    #   The condition used for the target document attribute or metadata
    #   field when ingesting documents into Amazon Q Business. You use this
    #   with [ `DocumentAttributeTarget` ][1] to apply the condition.
    #
    #   For example, you can create the 'Department' target field and have
    #   it prefill department names associated with the documents based on
    #   information in the 'Source\_URI' field. Set the condition that if
    #   the 'Source\_URI' field contains 'financial' in its URI value,
    #   then prefill the target field 'Department' with the target value
    #   'Finance' for the document.
    #
    #   Amazon Q Business can't create a target field if it has not already
    #   been created as an index field. After you create your index field,
    #   you can create a document metadata field using
    #   `DocumentAttributeTarget`. Amazon Q Business then will map your
    #   newly created metadata field to your index field.

    #   @return [Types::DocumentAttributeCondition]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] target
    #   The target document attribute or metadata field you want to alter
    #   when ingesting documents into Amazon Q Business.
    #
    #   For example, you can delete all customer identification numbers
    #   associated with the documents, stored in the document metadata field
    #   called 'Customer\_ID' by setting the target key as
    #   'Customer\_ID' and the deletion flag to `TRUE`. This removes all
    #   customer ID values in the field 'Customer\_ID'. This would scrub
    #   personally identifiable information from each document's metadata.
    #
    #   Amazon Q Business can't create a target field if it has not already
    #   been created as an index field. After you create your index field,
    #   you can create a document metadata field using [
    #   `DocumentAttributeTarget` ][1]. Amazon Q Business will then map your
    #   newly created document attribute to your index field.
    #
    #   You can also use this with [ `DocumentAttributeCondition` ][2].
