    # @!attribute [rw] monitor_specification
    #   Use `Expression` to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
    #   patterns:
    #
    #   * Simple dimension values - You can set the dimension name and
    #     values for the filters that you plan to use. For example, you can
    #     filter for `REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1`. For
    #     `GetRightsizingRecommendation`, the Region is a full name (for
    #     example, `REGION==US East (N. Virginia)`. The `Expression` example
    #     is as follows:
    #
    #     `\{ "Dimensions": \{ "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",
    #     “us-west-1” ] \} \}`
    #
    #     The list of dimension values are OR'd together to retrieve cost
    #     or usage data. You can create `Expression` and `DimensionValues`
    #     objects using either `with*` methods or `set*` methods in multiple
    #     lines.
    #
    #   * Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can use
    #     multiple `Expression` types and the logical operators `AND/OR/NOT`
    #     to create a list of one or more `Expression` objects. By doing
    #     this, you can filter on more advanced options. For example, you
    #     can filter on `((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR
    #     (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)`. The
    #     `Expression` for that is as follows:
    #
    #     `\{ "And": [ \{"Or": [ \{"Dimensions": \{ "Key": "REGION",
    #     "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] \}\}, \{"Tags": \{ "Key":
    #     "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] \} \} ]\}, \{"Not":
    #     \{"Dimensions": \{ "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"]
    #     \}\}\} ] \} `
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Because each `Expression` can have only one operator, the service
    #     returns an error if more than one is specified. The following
    #     example shows an `Expression` object that creates an error.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #     ` \{ "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": \{ "Dimension":
    #     "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] \} \} `
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> For the `GetRightsizingRecommendation` action, a combination of OR
    #   and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different
    #   dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators aren't supported.
    #   Dimensions are also limited to `LINKED_ACCOUNT`, `REGION`, or
    #   `RIGHTSIZING_TYPE`.
    #
    #    For the `GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation` action, only NOT is
    #   supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited to

    #   An [Expression][1] object used to categorize costs. This supports

    #   `RECORD_TYPE`, and `LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME`.
    #
    #   Root level `OR` isn't supported. We recommend that you create a
    #   separate rule instead.
    #
    #   `RECORD_TYPE` is a dimension used for Cost Explorer APIs, and is
    #   also supported for Cost Category expressions. This dimension uses
    #   different terms, depending on whether you're using the console or
    #   API/JSON editor. For a detailed comparison, see [Term
    #   Comparisons][2] in the *Billing and Cost Management User Guide*.

    #   flexibility to define a rule that dynamically inherits the cost
    #   category value. This value is from the dimension value that's
    #   defined by `CostCategoryInheritedValueDimension`. For example,

    #   the value of a specific tag key. First, choose an inherited value
    #   rule type, and then choose the tag dimension and specify the tag key

    # Use `Expression` to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
    # patterns:
    #
    # * Simple dimension values - You can set the dimension name and values
    #   for the filters that you plan to use. For example, you can filter
    #   for `REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1`. For
    #   `GetRightsizingRecommendation`, the Region is a full name (for
    #   example, `REGION==US East (N. Virginia)`. The `Expression` example
    #   is as follows:
    #
    #   `\{ "Dimensions": \{ "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",
    #   “us-west-1” ] \} \}`
    #
    #   The list of dimension values are OR'd together to retrieve cost or
    #   usage data. You can create `Expression` and `DimensionValues`
    #   objects using either `with*` methods or `set*` methods in multiple
    #   lines.
    #
    # * Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can use
    #   multiple `Expression` types and the logical operators `AND/OR/NOT`
    #   to create a list of one or more `Expression` objects. By doing this,
    #   you can filter on more advanced options. For example, you can filter
    #   on `((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type ==
    #   Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)`. The `Expression` for that
    #   is as follows:
    #
    #   `\{ "And": [ \{"Or": [ \{"Dimensions": \{ "Key": "REGION", "Values":
    #   [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] \}\}, \{"Tags": \{ "Key": "TagName",
    #   "Values": ["Value1"] \} \} ]\}, \{"Not": \{"Dimensions": \{ "Key":
    #   "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] \}\}\} ] \} `
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Because each `Expression` can have only one operator, the service
    #   returns an error if more than one is specified. The following
    #   example shows an `Expression` object that creates an error.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   ` \{ "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": \{ "Dimension":
    #   "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] \} \} `
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> For the `GetRightsizingRecommendation` action, a combination of OR and
    # NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different
    # dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators aren't supported.
    # Dimensions are also limited to `LINKED_ACCOUNT`, `REGION`, or
    # `RIGHTSIZING_TYPE`.
    #
    #  For the `GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation` action, only NOT is
    # supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited to
    # `LINKED_ACCOUNT`.

    #   The `GetCostAndUsageWithResources` operation requires that you

    #   <note markdown="1"> If you return the `UsageQuantity` metric, the service aggregates all

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] filter
    #   Use `Expression` to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
    #   patterns:
    #
    #   * Simple dimension values - You can set the dimension name and
    #     values for the filters that you plan to use. For example, you can
    #     filter for `REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1`. For
    #     `GetRightsizingRecommendation`, the Region is a full name (for
    #     example, `REGION==US East (N. Virginia)`. The `Expression` example
    #     is as follows:
    #
    #     `\{ "Dimensions": \{ "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",
    #     “us-west-1” ] \} \}`
    #
    #     The list of dimension values are OR'd together to retrieve cost
    #     or usage data. You can create `Expression` and `DimensionValues`
    #     objects using either `with*` methods or `set*` methods in multiple
    #     lines.
    #
    #   * Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can use
    #     multiple `Expression` types and the logical operators `AND/OR/NOT`
    #     to create a list of one or more `Expression` objects. By doing
    #     this, you can filter on more advanced options. For example, you
    #     can filter on `((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR
    #     (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)`. The
    #     `Expression` for that is as follows:
    #
    #     `\{ "And": [ \{"Or": [ \{"Dimensions": \{ "Key": "REGION",
    #     "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] \}\}, \{"Tags": \{ "Key":
    #     "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] \} \} ]\}, \{"Not":
    #     \{"Dimensions": \{ "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"]
    #     \}\}\} ] \} `
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Because each `Expression` can have only one operator, the service
    #     returns an error if more than one is specified. The following
    #     example shows an `Expression` object that creates an error.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #     ` \{ "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": \{ "Dimension":
    #     "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] \} \} `
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> For the `GetRightsizingRecommendation` action, a combination of OR
    #   and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different
    #   dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators aren't supported.
    #   Dimensions are also limited to `LINKED_ACCOUNT`, `REGION`, or
    #   `RIGHTSIZING_TYPE`.
    #
    #    For the `GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation` action, only NOT is
    #   supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited to
    #   `LINKED_ACCOUNT`.

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] filter
    #   Use `Expression` to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
    #   patterns:
    #
    #   * Simple dimension values - You can set the dimension name and
    #     values for the filters that you plan to use. For example, you can
    #     filter for `REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1`. For
    #     `GetRightsizingRecommendation`, the Region is a full name (for
    #     example, `REGION==US East (N. Virginia)`. The `Expression` example
    #     is as follows:
    #
    #     `\{ "Dimensions": \{ "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",
    #     “us-west-1” ] \} \}`
    #
    #     The list of dimension values are OR'd together to retrieve cost
    #     or usage data. You can create `Expression` and `DimensionValues`
    #     objects using either `with*` methods or `set*` methods in multiple
    #     lines.
    #
    #   * Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can use
    #     multiple `Expression` types and the logical operators `AND/OR/NOT`
    #     to create a list of one or more `Expression` objects. By doing
    #     this, you can filter on more advanced options. For example, you
    #     can filter on `((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR
    #     (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)`. The
    #     `Expression` for that is as follows:
    #
    #     `\{ "And": [ \{"Or": [ \{"Dimensions": \{ "Key": "REGION",
    #     "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] \}\}, \{"Tags": \{ "Key":
    #     "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] \} \} ]\}, \{"Not":
    #     \{"Dimensions": \{ "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"]
    #     \}\}\} ] \} `
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Because each `Expression` can have only one operator, the service
    #     returns an error if more than one is specified. The following
    #     example shows an `Expression` object that creates an error.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #     ` \{ "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": \{ "Dimension":
    #     "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] \} \} `
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> For the `GetRightsizingRecommendation` action, a combination of OR
    #   and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different
    #   dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators aren't supported.
    #   Dimensions are also limited to `LINKED_ACCOUNT`, `REGION`, or
    #   `RIGHTSIZING_TYPE`.
    #
    #    For the `GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation` action, only NOT is
    #   supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited to

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] filter
    #   Use `Expression` to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
    #   patterns:
    #
    #   * Simple dimension values - You can set the dimension name and
    #     values for the filters that you plan to use. For example, you can
    #     filter for `REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1`. For
    #     `GetRightsizingRecommendation`, the Region is a full name (for
    #     example, `REGION==US East (N. Virginia)`. The `Expression` example
    #     is as follows:
    #
    #     `\{ "Dimensions": \{ "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",
    #     “us-west-1” ] \} \}`
    #
    #     The list of dimension values are OR'd together to retrieve cost
    #     or usage data. You can create `Expression` and `DimensionValues`
    #     objects using either `with*` methods or `set*` methods in multiple
    #     lines.
    #
    #   * Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can use
    #     multiple `Expression` types and the logical operators `AND/OR/NOT`
    #     to create a list of one or more `Expression` objects. By doing
    #     this, you can filter on more advanced options. For example, you
    #     can filter on `((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR
    #     (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)`. The
    #     `Expression` for that is as follows:
    #
    #     `\{ "And": [ \{"Or": [ \{"Dimensions": \{ "Key": "REGION",
    #     "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] \}\}, \{"Tags": \{ "Key":
    #     "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] \} \} ]\}, \{"Not":
    #     \{"Dimensions": \{ "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"]
    #     \}\}\} ] \} `
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Because each `Expression` can have only one operator, the service
    #     returns an error if more than one is specified. The following
    #     example shows an `Expression` object that creates an error.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #     ` \{ "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": \{ "Dimension":
    #     "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] \} \} `
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> For the `GetRightsizingRecommendation` action, a combination of OR
    #   and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different
    #   dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators aren't supported.
    #   Dimensions are also limited to `LINKED_ACCOUNT`, `REGION`, or
    #   `RIGHTSIZING_TYPE`.
    #
    #    For the `GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation` action, only NOT is
    #   supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited to
    #   `LINKED_ACCOUNT`.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] filter
    #   Use `Expression` to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
    #   patterns:
    #
    #   * Simple dimension values - You can set the dimension name and
    #     values for the filters that you plan to use. For example, you can
    #     filter for `REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1`. For
    #     `GetRightsizingRecommendation`, the Region is a full name (for
    #     example, `REGION==US East (N. Virginia)`. The `Expression` example
    #     is as follows:
    #
    #     `\{ "Dimensions": \{ "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",
    #     “us-west-1” ] \} \}`
    #
    #     The list of dimension values are OR'd together to retrieve cost
    #     or usage data. You can create `Expression` and `DimensionValues`
    #     objects using either `with*` methods or `set*` methods in multiple
    #     lines.
    #
    #   * Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can use
    #     multiple `Expression` types and the logical operators `AND/OR/NOT`
    #     to create a list of one or more `Expression` objects. By doing
    #     this, you can filter on more advanced options. For example, you
    #     can filter on `((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR
    #     (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)`. The
    #     `Expression` for that is as follows:
    #
    #     `\{ "And": [ \{"Or": [ \{"Dimensions": \{ "Key": "REGION",
    #     "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] \}\}, \{"Tags": \{ "Key":
    #     "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] \} \} ]\}, \{"Not":
    #     \{"Dimensions": \{ "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"]
    #     \}\}\} ] \} `
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Because each `Expression` can have only one operator, the service
    #     returns an error if more than one is specified. The following
    #     example shows an `Expression` object that creates an error.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #     ` \{ "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": \{ "Dimension":
    #     "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] \} \} `
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> For the `GetRightsizingRecommendation` action, a combination of OR
    #   and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different
    #   dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators aren't supported.
    #   Dimensions are also limited to `LINKED_ACCOUNT`, `REGION`, or
    #   `RIGHTSIZING_TYPE`.
    #
    #    For the `GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation` action, only NOT is
    #   supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited to
    #   `LINKED_ACCOUNT`.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] filter
    #   Use `Expression` to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
    #   patterns:
    #
    #   * Simple dimension values - You can set the dimension name and
    #     values for the filters that you plan to use. For example, you can
    #     filter for `REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1`. For
    #     `GetRightsizingRecommendation`, the Region is a full name (for
    #     example, `REGION==US East (N. Virginia)`. The `Expression` example
    #     is as follows:
    #
    #     `\{ "Dimensions": \{ "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",
    #     “us-west-1” ] \} \}`
    #
    #     The list of dimension values are OR'd together to retrieve cost
    #     or usage data. You can create `Expression` and `DimensionValues`
    #     objects using either `with*` methods or `set*` methods in multiple
    #     lines.
    #
    #   * Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can use
    #     multiple `Expression` types and the logical operators `AND/OR/NOT`
    #     to create a list of one or more `Expression` objects. By doing
    #     this, you can filter on more advanced options. For example, you
    #     can filter on `((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR
    #     (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)`. The
    #     `Expression` for that is as follows:
    #
    #     `\{ "And": [ \{"Or": [ \{"Dimensions": \{ "Key": "REGION",
    #     "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] \}\}, \{"Tags": \{ "Key":
    #     "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] \} \} ]\}, \{"Not":
    #     \{"Dimensions": \{ "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"]
    #     \}\}\} ] \} `
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Because each `Expression` can have only one operator, the service
    #     returns an error if more than one is specified. The following
    #     example shows an `Expression` object that creates an error.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #     ` \{ "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": \{ "Dimension":
    #     "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] \} \} `
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> For the `GetRightsizingRecommendation` action, a combination of OR
    #   and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different
    #   dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators aren't supported.
    #   Dimensions are also limited to `LINKED_ACCOUNT`, `REGION`, or
    #   `RIGHTSIZING_TYPE`.
    #
    #    For the `GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation` action, only NOT is
    #   supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited to
    #   `LINKED_ACCOUNT`.
