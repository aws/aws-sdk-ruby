    #
    #     For example, you can use this operation to return the interpolated
    #     temperature values for a wind turbine every 24 hours over a
    #     duration of 7 days. If the interpolation starts July 1, 2021, at 9
    #     AM, IoT SiteWise returns the first interpolated value on July 2,
    #     2021, at 9 AM, the second interpolated value on July 3, 2021, at 9
    #     AM, and so on.
    #
    #   * `LOCF_INTERPOLATION` – Estimates missing data using last
    #     observation carried forward interpolation
    #
    #     If no data point is found for an interval, IoT SiteWise returns
    #     the last observed data point for the previous interval and carries
    #     forward this interpolated value until a new data point is found.
    #
    #     For example, you can get the state of an on-off valve every 24
    #     hours over a duration of 7 days. If the interpolation starts July
    #     1, 2021, at 9 AM, IoT SiteWise returns the last observed data
    #     point between July 1, 2021, at 9 AM and July 2, 2021, at 9 AM as
    #     the first interpolated value. If a data point isn't found after 9
    #     AM on July 2, 2021, IoT SiteWise uses the same interpolated value
    #     for the rest of the days.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] interval_window_in_seconds
    #   The query interval for the window, in seconds. IoT SiteWise computes
    #   each interpolated value by using data points from the timestamp of
    #   each interval, minus the window to the timestamp of each interval
    #   plus the window. If not specified, the window ranges between the
    #   start time minus the interval and the end time plus the interval.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> * If you specify a value for the `intervalWindowInSeconds`
    #     parameter, the value for the `type` parameter must be
    #     `LINEAR_INTERPOLATION`.
    #
    #   * If a data point isn't found during the specified query window,
    #     IoT SiteWise won't return an interpolated value for the interval.
    #     This indicates that there's a gap in the ingested data points.

    #   hours, IoT SiteWise uses the data points from 7 AM (9 AM minus 2
    #   hours) to 11 AM (9 AM plus 2 hours) on July 2, 2021 to compute the
    #   first interpolated value. Next, IoT SiteWise uses the data points

    # Contains a tumbling window, which is a repeating fixed-sized,
    # non-overlapping, and contiguous time window. You can use this window
    # in metrics to aggregate data from properties and other assets.
    #
    # You can use `m`, `h`, `d`, and `w` when you specify an interval or
    # offset. Note that `m` represents minutes, `h` represents hours, `d`
    # represents days, and `w` represents weeks. You can also use `s` to
    # represent seconds in `offset`.
    #
    # The `interval` and `offset` parameters support the [ISO 8601
    # format][1]. For example, `PT5S` represents 5 seconds, `PT5M`
    # represents 5 minutes, and `PT5H` represents 5 hours.
    #
    #
    #
    # [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] interval
    #   The time interval for the tumbling window. The interval time must be
    #   between 1 minute and 1 week.
    #
    #   IoT SiteWise computes the `1w` interval the end of Sunday at
    #   midnight each week (UTC), the `1d` interval at the end of each day
    #   at midnight (UTC), the `1h` interval at the end of each hour, and so
    #   on.
    #
    #   When IoT SiteWise aggregates data points for metric computations,
    #   the start of each interval is exclusive and the end of each interval
    #   is inclusive. IoT SiteWise places the computed data point at the end
    #   of the interval.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] offset
    #   The offset for the tumbling window. The `offset` parameter accepts
    #   the following:
    #
    #   * The offset time.
    #
    #     For example, if you specify `18h` for `offset` and `1d` for
    #     `interval`, IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following
    #     ways:
    #
    #     * If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (UTC), you get the
    #       first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) on the day when you
    #       create the metric.
    #
    #     * If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you get the first
    #       aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.
    #
    #   * The ISO 8601 format.
    #
    #     For example, if you specify `PT18H` for `offset` and `1d` for
    #     `interval`, IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following
    #     ways:
    #
    #     * If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (UTC), you get the
    #       first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) on the day when you
    #       create the metric.
    #
    #     * If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you get the first
    #       aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.
    #
    #   * The 24-hour clock.
    #
    #     For example, if you specify `00:03:00` for `offset`, `5m` for
    #     `interval`, and you create the metric at 2 PM (UTC), you get the
    #     first aggregation result at 2:03 PM (UTC). You get the second
    #     aggregation result at 2:08 PM (UTC).
    #
    #   * The offset time zone.
    #
    #     For example, if you specify `2021-07-23T18:00-08` for `offset` and
    #     `1d` for `interval`, IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the
    #     following ways:
    #
    #     * If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (PST), you get the
    #       first aggregation result at 6 PM (PST) on the day when you
    #       create the metric.
    #
    #     * If you create the metric after 6 PM (PST), you get the first
    #       aggregation result at 6 PM (PST) the next day.
