# This module provides support for Amazon HealthLake. This module is available in the
# `aws-sdk-healthlake` gem.

# # Client
#
# The {Client} class provides one method for each API operation. Operation
# methods each accept a hash of request parameters and return a response
# structure.

# See {Client} for more information.
#
# # Errors
#
# Errors returned from Amazon HealthLake are defined in the
# {Errors} module and all extend {Errors::ServiceError}.
#
