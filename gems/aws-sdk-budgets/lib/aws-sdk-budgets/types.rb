    #
    #   `BudgetLimit` is required for cost or usage budgets, but optional
    #   for RI or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. RI and
    #   Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets default to `100`. This
    #   is the only valid value for RI or Savings Plans utilization or

    #
    #   `PlannedBudgetLimits` is available for cost or usage budget and
    #   supports both monthly and quarterly `TimeUnit`.
    #
    #   For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of `PlannedBudgetLimits`
    #   values. This must start from the current month and include the next
    #   11 months. The `key` is the start of the month, `UTC` in epoch
    #   seconds.
    #
    #   For quarterly budgets, provide four quarters of
    #   `PlannedBudgetLimits` value entries in standard calendar quarter
    #   increments. This must start from the current quarter and include the
    #   next three quarters. The `key` is the start of the quarter, `UTC` in
    #   epoch seconds.
    #
    #   If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or four
    #   quarters for quarterly, provide the `PlannedBudgetLimits` values
    #   only for the remaining periods.
    #
    #   If the budget begins at a date in the future, provide
    #   `PlannedBudgetLimits` values from the start date of the budget.
    #
    #   After all of the `BudgetLimit` values in `PlannedBudgetLimits` are
    #   used, the budget continues to use the last limit as the
    #   `BudgetLimit`. At that point, the planned budget provides the same
    #   experience as a fixed budget.
    #
    #   `DescribeBudget` and `DescribeBudgets` response along with
    #   `PlannedBudgetLimits` also contain `BudgetLimit` representing the
    #   current month or quarter limit present in `PlannedBudgetLimits`.
    #   This only applies to budgets that are created with
    #   `PlannedBudgetLimits`. Budgets that are created without
    #   `PlannedBudgetLimits` only contain `BudgetLimit`. They don't

    #
    #   If you create your budget and don't specify a start date, Amazon
    #   Web Services defaults to the start of your chosen time period
    #   (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you
    #   created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose `DAILY`, and didn't
    #   set a start date, Amazon Web Services set your start date to
    #   `01/24/18 00:00 UTC`. If you chose `MONTHLY`, Amazon Web Services
    #   set your start date to `01/01/18 00:00 UTC`. If you didn't specify
    #   an end date, Amazon Web Services set your end date to `06/15/87
    #   00:00 UTC`. The defaults are the same for the Billing and Cost
    #   Management console and the API.
    #
    #   You can change either date with the `UpdateBudget` operation.
