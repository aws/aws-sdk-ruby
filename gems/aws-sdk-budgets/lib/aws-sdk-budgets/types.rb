    #   The total amount of cost, usage, or RI utilization that you want to
    #   track with your budget.
    #
    #   `BudgetLimit` is required for cost or usage budgets, but optional
    #   for RI utilization budgets. RI utilization budgets default to the
    #   only valid value for RI utilization budgets, which is `100`.
    #   @return [Types::Spend]

    #   The length of time until a budget resets the actual and forecasted
    #   spend.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] time_period
    #   The period of time covered by a budget. Has a start date and an end
    #   date. The start date must come before the end date. There are no
    #   restrictions on the end date.
    #
    #   If you created your budget and didn't specify a start date, AWS
    #   defaults to the start of your chosen time period (i.e. DAILY,
    #   MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your
    #   budget on January 24th 2018, chose `DAILY`, and didn't set a start
    #   date, AWS set your start date to `01/24/18 00:00 UTC`. If you chose
    #   `MONTHLY`, AWS set your start date to `01/01/18 00:00 UTC`. If you
    #   didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date to `06/15/87
    #   00:00 UTC`. The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost
    #   Management console and the API.
    #
    #   You can change either date with the `UpdateBudget` operation.
    #
    #   After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated
    #   notifications and subscribers.
