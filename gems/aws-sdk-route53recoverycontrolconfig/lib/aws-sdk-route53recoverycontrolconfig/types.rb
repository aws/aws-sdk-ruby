    #   configuration that you specify, which allows a set of routing
    #   control state changes to complete.
    #
    #   For example, if you specify one gating routing control and you set
    #   the Type in the rule configuration to OR, that indicates that you
    #   must set the gating routing control to On for the rule to evaluate
    #   as true; that is, for the gating control "switch" to be "On".
