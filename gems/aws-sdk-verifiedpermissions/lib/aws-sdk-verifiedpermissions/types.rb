    # The request failed because one or more input parameters don't satisfy
    # their constraint requirements. The output is provided as a list of
    # fields and a reason for each field that isn't valid.
    #
    # The possible reasons include the following:
    #
    # * **UnrecognizedEntityType**
    #
    #   The policy includes an entity type that isn't found in the schema.
    #
    # * **UnrecognizedActionId**
    #
    #   The policy includes an action id that isn't found in the schema.
    #
    # * **InvalidActionApplication**
    #
    #   The policy includes an action that, according to the schema,
    #   doesn't support the specified principal and resource.
    #
    # * **UnexpectedType**
    #
    #   The policy included an operand that isn't a valid type for the
    #   specified operation.
    #
    # * **IncompatibleTypes**
    #
    #   The types of elements included in a `set`, or the types of
    #   expressions used in an `if...then...else` clause aren't compatible
    #   in this context.
    #
    # * **MissingAttribute**
    #
    #   The policy attempts to access a record or entity attribute that
    #   isn't specified in the schema. Test for the existence of the
    #   attribute first before attempting to access its value. For more
    #   information, see the [has (presence of attribute test) operator][1]
    #   in the *Cedar Policy Language Guide*.
    #
    # * **UnsafeOptionalAttributeAccess**
    #
    #   The policy attempts to access a record or entity attribute that is
    #   optional and isn't guaranteed to be present. Test for the existence
    #   of the attribute first before attempting to access its value. For
    #   more information, see the [has (presence of attribute test)
    #   operator][1] in the *Cedar Policy Language Guide*.
    #
    # * **ImpossiblePolicy**
    #
    #   Cedar has determined that a policy condition always evaluates to
    #   false. If the policy is always false, it can never apply to any
    #   query, and so it can never affect an authorization decision.
    #
    # * **WrongNumberArguments**
    #
    #   The policy references an extension type with the wrong number of
    #   arguments.
    #
    # * **FunctionArgumentValidationError**
    #
    #   Cedar couldn't parse the argument passed to an extension type. For
    #   example, a string that is to be parsed as an IPv4 address can
    #   contain only digits and the period character.

    # @!attribute [rw] mode
    #   The validation mode currently configured for this policy store. The

    #     validation on policies. No validation errors are reported by
    #     either service.
    #
    #   * **STRICT** – Requires a schema to be present in the policy store.
    #     Cedar performs validation on all submitted new or updated static
    #     policies and policy templates. Any that fail validation are
    #     rejected and Cedar doesn't store them in the policy store.
    #
    #   If `Mode=STRICT` and the policy store doesn't contain a schema,
    #   Verified Permissions rejects all static policies and policy
    #   templates because there is no schema to validate against.
    #
    #    To submit a static policy or policy template without a schema, you
    #   must turn off validation.
