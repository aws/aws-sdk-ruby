    # @!attribute [rw] resource_tags
    #   Specifies the resource tags to use to identify resources that are to

    #   rules, only deleted resources, of the specified resource type, that
    #   have one or more of the specified tag key and value pairs are
    #   retained. If a resource is deleted, but it does not have any of the
    #   specified tag key and value pairs, it is immediately deleted without
    #   being retained by the retention rule.
    #
    #   You can add the same tag key and value pair to a maximum or five
    #   retention rules.
    #
    #   To create a Region-level retention rule, omit this parameter. A
    #   Region-level retention rule does not have any resource tags
    #   specified. It retains all deleted resources of the specified
