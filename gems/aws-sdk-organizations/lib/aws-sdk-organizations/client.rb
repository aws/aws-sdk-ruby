    # @overload initialize(options)
    #   @param [Hash] options
    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading static credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleWebIdentityCredentials` - Used when you need to
    #       assume a role after providing credentials via the web.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SSOCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from AWS SSO using an
    #       access token generated from `aws login`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ProcessCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       process that outputs to stdout.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ECSCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from
    #       instances running in ECS.
    #
    #     * `Aws::CognitoIdentityCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from the Cognito Identity service.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2/ECS IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts
    #       are very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #       `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` or `Aws::ECSCredentials` to
    #       enable retries and extended timeouts. Instance profile credential
    #       fetching can be disabled by setting ENV['AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED']
    #       to true.

    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:region]`
    #     * `ENV['AWS_REGION']`
    #     * `ENV['AMAZON_REGION']`
    #     * `ENV['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION']`

    #   @option options [Integer] :max_attempts (3)
    #     An integer representing the maximum number attempts that will be made for
    #     a single request, including the initial attempt.  For example,
    #     setting this value to 5 will result in a request being retried up to
    #     4 times. Used in `standard` and `adaptive` retry modes.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :profile ("default")
    #     Used when loading credentials from the shared credentials file
    #     at HOME/.aws/credentials.  When not specified, 'default' is used.
    #
    #   @option options [Proc] :retry_backoff
    #     A proc or lambda used for backoff. Defaults to 2**retries * retry_base_delay.

    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_limit (3)
    #     The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #     ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #     are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #     checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors, auth errors,
    #     endpoint discovery, and errors from expired credentials.
    #     This option is only used in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_max_delay (0)
    #     The maximum number of seconds to delay between retries (0 for no limit)
    #     used by the default backoff function. This option is only used in the

    #     * `legacy` - The pre-existing retry behavior.  This is default value if
    #       no retry mode is provided.
    #
    #     * `standard` - A standardized set of retry rules across the AWS SDKs.
    #       This includes support for retry quotas, which limit the number of
    #       unsuccessful retries a client can make.
    #
    #     * `adaptive` - An experimental retry mode that includes all the
    #       functionality of `standard` mode along with automatic client side
    #       throttling.  This is a provisional mode that may change behavior
    #       in the future.
    #
    #
    #   @option options [String] :secret_access_key
    #
    #   @option options [String] :session_token
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :simple_json (false)
    #     Disables request parameter conversion, validation, and formatting.
    #     Also disable response data type conversions. This option is useful
    #     when you want to ensure the highest level of performance by
    #     avoiding overhead of walking request parameters and response data
    #     structures.
    #
    #     When `:simple_json` is enabled, the request parameters hash must
    #     be formatted exactly as the DynamoDB API expects.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #     Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #     fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #     the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #     {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #     ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #     requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :use_dualstack_endpoint
    #     When set to `true`, dualstack enabled endpoints (with `.aws` TLD)
    #     will be used if available.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :use_fips_endpoint
    #     When set to `true`, fips compatible endpoints will be used if available.
    #     When a `fips` region is used, the region is normalized and this config
    #     is set to `true`.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #     When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #     sending the request.
    #
    #   @option options [URI::HTTP,String] :http_proxy A proxy to send
    #     requests through.  Formatted like 'http://proxy.com:123'.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_open_timeout (15) The number of
    #     seconds to wait when opening a HTTP session before raising a
    #     `Timeout::Error`.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_read_timeout (60) The default
    #     number of seconds to wait for response data.  This value can
    #     safely be set per-request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_idle_timeout (5) The number of
    #     seconds a connection is allowed to sit idle before it is
    #     considered stale.  Stale connections are closed and removed
    #     from the pool before making a request.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_continue_timeout (1) The number of
    #     seconds to wait for a 100-continue response before sending the
    #     request body.  This option has no effect unless the request has
    #     "Expect" header set to "100-continue".  Defaults to `nil` which
    #     disables this behaviour.  This value can safely be set per
    #     request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :ssl_timeout (nil) Sets the SSL timeout
    #     in seconds.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :http_wire_trace (false) When `true`,
    #     HTTP debug output will be sent to the `:logger`.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :ssl_verify_peer (true) When `true`,
    #     SSL peer certificates are verified when establishing a
    #     connection.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_bundle Full path to the SSL
    #     certificate authority bundle file that should be used when
    #     verifying peer certificates.  If you do not pass
    #     `:ssl_ca_bundle` or `:ssl_ca_directory` the the system default
    #     will be used if available.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_directory Full path of the
    #     directory that contains the unbundled SSL certificate
    #     authority files for verifying peer certificates.  If you do
    #     not pass `:ssl_ca_bundle` or `:ssl_ca_directory` the the
    #     system default will be used if available.

    # Creates an AWS account that is automatically a member of the
    # organization whose credentials made the request. This is an
    # asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background. Because
    # `CreateAccount` operates asynchronously, it can return a successful
    # completion message even though account initialization might still be
    # in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can
    # successfully access the account. To check the status of the request,
    # do one of the following:
    #
    # * Use the `Id` member of the `CreateAccountStatus` response element
    #   from this operation to provide as a parameter to the
    #   DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.
    #
    # * Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the `CreateAccountResult` event.
    #   For information on using AWS CloudTrail with AWS Organizations, see
    #   [Logging and monitoring in AWS Organizations][1] in the *AWS
    #   Organizations User Guide.*
    #
    # The user who calls the API to create an account must have the
    # `organizations:CreateAccount` permission. If you enabled all features
    # in the organization, AWS Organizations creates the required
    # service-linked role named `AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations`. For more
    # information, see [AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles][2] in
    # the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.
    #
    # If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the
    # `organizations:TagResource` permission.
    #
    # AWS Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role
    # (named `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` by default) that grants users
    # in the management account administrator permissions in the new member
    # account. Principals in the management account can assume the role. AWS
    # Organizations clones the company name and address information for the
    # new account from the organization's management account.
    #
    # This operation can be called only from the organization's management
    # account.
    #
    # For more information about creating accounts, see [Creating an AWS
    # Account in Your Organization][3] in the *AWS Organizations User
    # Guide.*
    #
    # * When you create an account in an organization using the AWS
    #   Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information
    #   required for the account to operate as a standalone account, such as
    #   a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA)
    #   is *not* automatically collected. If you must remove an account from
    #   your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the
    #   missing information. Follow the steps at [ To leave an organization
    #   as a member account][4] in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.
    #
    # * If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your
    #   account limits for the organization, contact [AWS Support][5].
    #
    # * If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed
    #   because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and
    #   then try again. If the error persists, contact [AWS Support][5].
    #
    # * Using `CreateAccount` to create multiple temporary accounts isn't
    #   recommended. You can only close an account from the Billing and Cost
    #   Management Console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For
    #   information on the requirements and process for closing an account,
    #   see [Closing an AWS Account][6] in the *AWS Organizations User
    #   Guide*.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose
    # whether to create the account with the **IAM User and Role Access to
    # Billing Information** switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and
    # roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information
    # for the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can

    #
    # AWS Organizations automatically creates the required service-linked
    # role named `AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations`. For more information, see
    # [AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles][2] in the *AWS
    # Organizations User Guide.*
    #
    # AWS automatically enables AWS CloudTrail for AWS GovCloud (US)
    # accounts, but you should also do the following:
    #
    # * Verify that AWS CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.
    #
    # * Create an S3 bucket for AWS CloudTrail log storage.
    #
    #   For more information, see [Verifying AWS CloudTrail Is Enabled][3]
    #   in the *AWS GovCloud User Guide*.
    #
    # If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the
    # `organizations:TagResource` permission. The tags are attached to the
    # commercial account associated with the GovCloud account, rather than
    # the GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the GovCloud account, call
    # the TagResource operation in the GovCloud Region after the new
    # GovCloud account exists.
    #
    # You call this action from the management account of your organization
    # in the commercial Region to create a standalone AWS account in the AWS
    # GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the management
    # account of an organization in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region can invite
    # it to that organization. For more information on inviting standalone
    # accounts in the AWS GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see [AWS
    # Organizations][4] in the *AWS GovCloud User Guide.*
    #
    # Calling `CreateGovCloudAccount` is an asynchronous request that AWS
    # performs in the background. Because `CreateGovCloudAccount` operates
    # asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even
    # though account initialization might still be in progress. You might
    # need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the
    # account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:
    #
    # * Use the `OperationId` response element from this operation to
    #   provide as a parameter to the DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.
    #
    # * Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the `CreateAccountResult` event.
    #   For information on using AWS CloudTrail with Organizations, see
    #   [Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization][5] in the *AWS
    #   Organizations User Guide.*
    #
    #
    #
    # When you call the `CreateGovCloudAccount` action, you create two
    # accounts: a standalone account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region and an
    # associated account in the commercial Region for billing and support
    # purposes. The account in the commercial Region is automatically a
    # member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both
    # accounts are associated with the same email address.
    #
    # A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that
    # allows the management account in the organization in the commercial
    # Region to assume it. An AWS GovCloud (US) account is then created and
    # associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role
    # is also created in the new AWS GovCloud (US) account that can be
    # assumed by the AWS GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the
    # management account of the commercial organization. For more
    # information and to view a diagram that explains how account access
    # works, see [AWS Organizations][4] in the *AWS GovCloud User Guide.*
    #
    # For more information about creating accounts, see [Creating an AWS
    # Account in Your Organization][6] in the *AWS Organizations User
    # Guide.*
    #
    # * When you create an account in an organization using the AWS
    #   Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information
    #   required for the account to operate as a standalone account is *not*
    #   automatically collected. This includes a payment method and signing
    #   the end user license agreement (EULA). If you must remove an account
    #   from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide
    #   the missing information. Follow the steps at [ To leave an
    #   organization as a member account][7] in the *AWS Organizations User
    #   Guide.*
    #
    # * If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your
    #   account limits for the organization, contact [AWS Support][8].
    #
    # * If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed
    #   because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and
    #   then try again. If the error persists, contact [AWS Support][8].
    #
    # * Using `CreateGovCloudAccount` to create multiple temporary accounts
    #   isn't recommended. You can only close an account from the AWS
    #   Billing and Cost Management console, and you must be signed in as
    #   the root user. For information on the requirements and process for
    #   closing an account, see [Closing an AWS Account][9] in the *AWS
    #   Organizations User Guide*.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose
    # whether to create the account with the **IAM User and Role Access to
    # Billing Information** switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and
    # roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information
    # for the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can
    # access billing information. For information about how to disable this
    # switch for an account, see [Granting Access to Your Billing
    # Information and Tools][10].

    # Disables the integration of an AWS service (the service that is
    # specified by `ServicePrincipal`) with AWS Organizations. When you
    # disable integration, the specified service no longer can create a
    # [service-linked role][1] in *new* accounts in your organization. This
    # means the service can't perform operations on your behalf on any new
    # accounts in your organization. The service can still perform
    # operations in older accounts until the service completes its clean-up
    # from AWS Organizations.
    #
    # We <b> <i>strongly recommend</i> </b> that you don't use this command
    # to disable integration between AWS Organizations and the specified AWS
    # service. Instead, use the console or commands that are provided by the
    # specified service. This lets the trusted service perform any required
    # initialization when enabling trusted access, such as creating any
    # required resources and any required clean up of resources when
    # disabling trusted access.
    #
    #  For information about how to disable trusted service access to your
    # organization using the trusted service, see the **Learn more** link
    # under the **Supports Trusted Access** column at [AWS services that you
    # can use with AWS Organizations][2]. on this page.
    #
    #  If you disable access by using this command, it causes the following
    # actions to occur:
    #
    #  * The service can no longer create a service-linked role in the
    #   accounts in your organization. This means that the service can't
    #   perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your
    #   organization. The service can still perform operations in older
    #   accounts until the service completes its clean-up from AWS
    #   Organizations.
    #
    # * The service can no longer perform tasks in the member accounts in
    #   the organization, unless those operations are explicitly permitted
    #   by the IAM policies that are attached to your roles. This includes
    #   any data aggregation from the member accounts to the management
    #   account, or to a delegated administrator account, where relevant.
    #
    # * Some services detect this and clean up any remaining data or
    #   resources related to the integration, while other services stop
    #   accessing the organization but leave any historical data and
    #   configuration in place to support a possible re-enabling of the
    #   integration.
    #
    #  Using the other service's console or commands to disable the
    # integration ensures that the other service is aware that it can clean
    # up any resources that are required only for the integration. How the
    # service cleans up its resources in the organization's accounts
    # depends on that service. For more information, see the documentation
    # for the other AWS service.
    #
    # After you perform the `DisableAWSServiceAccess` operation, the
    # specified service can no longer perform operations in your
    # organization's accounts

    # @option params [required, Types::HandshakeParty] :target
    #   The identifier (ID) of the AWS account that you want to invite to join
    #   your organization. This is a JSON object that contains the following
    #   elements:
    #
    #   `\{ "Type": "ACCOUNT", "Id": "< account id number >" \}`
    #
    #   If you use the AWS CLI, you can submit this as a single string,
    #   similar to the following example:
    #
    #   `--target Id=123456789012,Type=ACCOUNT`
    #
    #   If you specify `"Type": "ACCOUNT"`, you must provide the AWS account
    #   ID number as the `Id`. If you specify `"Type": "EMAIL"`, you must
    #   specify the email address that is associated with the account.
    #
    #   `--target Id=diego@example.com,Type=EMAIL`
    #
    # @option params [String] :notes
    #   Additional information that you want to include in the generated email
    #   to the recipient account owner.
    #
    # @option params [Array<Types::Tag>] :tags
    #   A list of tags that you want to attach to the account when it becomes
    #   a member of the organization. For each tag in the list, you must
    #   specify both a tag key and a value. You can set the value to an empty
    #   string, but you can't set it to `null`. For more information about
    #   tagging, see [Tagging AWS Organizations resources][1] in the AWS
    #   Organizations User Guide.
    #
    #   Any tags in the request are checked for compliance with any applicable
    #   tag policies when the request is made. The request is rejected if the
    #   tags in the request don't match the requirements of the policy at
    #   that time. Tag policy compliance is <i> <b>not</b> </i> checked again
    #   when the invitation is accepted and the tags are actually attached to
    #   the account. That means that if the tag policy changes between the
    #   invitation and the acceptance, then that tags could potentially be
    #   non-compliant.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed number
    #   of tags for an account, then the entire request fails and invitations
    #   are not sent.

    # * The management account in an organization with all features enabled
    #   can set service control policies (SCPs) that can restrict what
    #   administrators of member accounts can do. This includes preventing
    #   them from successfully calling `LeaveOrganization` and leaving the
    #   organization.
    #
    # * You can leave an organization as a member account only if the
    #   account is configured with the information required to operate as a
    #   standalone account. When you create an account in an organization
    #   using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the
    #   information required of standalone accounts is *not* automatically
    #   collected. For each account that you want to make standalone, you
    #   must perform the following steps. If any of the steps are already
    #   completed for this account, that step doesn't appear.
    #
    #   * Choose a support plan
    #
    #   * Provide and verify the required contact information
    #
    #   * Provide a current payment method
    #
    #   AWS uses the payment method to charge for any billable (not free
    #   tier) AWS activity that occurs while the account isn't attached to
    #   an organization. Follow the steps at [ To leave an organization when
    #   all required account information has not yet been provided][1] in
    #   the *AWS Organizations User Guide.*
    #
    # * The account that you want to leave must not be a delegated
    #   administrator account for any AWS service enabled for your
    #   organization. If the account is a delegated administrator, you must
    #   first change the delegated administrator account to another account
    #   that is remaining in the organization.
    #
    # * You can leave an organization only after you enable IAM user access
    #   to billing in your account. For more information, see [Activating
    #   Access to the Billing and Cost Management Console][2] in the *AWS
    #   Billing and Cost Management User Guide.*
    #
    # * After the account leaves the organization, all tags that were
    #   attached to the account object in the organization are deleted. AWS
    #   accounts outside of an organization do not support tags.
    #
    # * A newly created account has a waiting period before it can be
    #   removed from its organization. If you get an error that indicates
    #   that a wait period is required, then try again in a few days.
