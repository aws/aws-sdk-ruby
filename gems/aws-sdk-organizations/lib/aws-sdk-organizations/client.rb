    # @overload initialize(options)
    #   @param [Hash] options
    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2 IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts are
    #       very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #       `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` to enable retries and extended
    #       timeouts.
    #
    #   @option options [required, String] :region
    #     The AWS region to connect to.  The configured `:region` is
    #     used to determine the service `:endpoint`. When not passed,

    #
    #   @option options [String] :profile ("default")
    #     Used when loading credentials from the shared credentials file
    #     at HOME/.aws/credentials.  When not specified, 'default' is used.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :retry_base_delay (0.3)

    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_limit (3)
    #     The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #     ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #     are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #     checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors and auth
    #     errors from expired credentials.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_max_delay (0)
    #     The maximum number of seconds to delay between retries (0 for no limit) used by the default backoff function.

    #
    #   @option options [String] :session_token
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :simple_json (false)
    #     Disables request parameter conversion, validation, and formatting.
    #     Also disable response data type conversions. This option is useful
    #     when you want to ensure the highest level of performance by
    #     avoiding overhead of walking request parameters and response data
    #     structures.
    #
    #     When `:simple_json` is enabled, the request parameters hash must
    #     be formatted exactly as the DynamoDB API expects.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #     Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #     fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #     the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #     {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #     ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #     requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #     When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #     sending the request.

    #     number of seconds to wait for response data.  This value can
    #     safely be set
    #     per-request on the session yeidled by {#session_for}.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_idle_timeout (5) The number of
    #     seconds a connection is allowed to sit idble before it is
    #     considered stale.  Stale connections are closed and removed
    #     from the pool before making a request.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_continue_timeout (1) The number of
    #     seconds to wait for a 100-continue response before sending the
    #     request body.  This option has no effect unless the request has
    #     "Expect" header set to "100-continue".  Defaults to `nil` which
    #     disables this behaviour.  This value can safely be set per
    #     request on the session yeidled by {#session_for}.

    #     SSL peer certificates are verified when establishing a
    #     connection.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_bundle Full path to the SSL
    #     certificate authority bundle file that should be used when
    #     verifying peer certificates.  If you do not pass
    #     `:ssl_ca_bundle` or `:ssl_ca_directory` the the system default
    #     will be used if available.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_directory Full path of the
    #     directory that contains the unbundled SSL certificate
    #     authority files for verifying peer certificates.  If you do

    # The user who calls the API to create an account must have the

    # information, see [AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles][2] in

    #
    # AWS Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role
    # (named `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` by default) that grants users
    # in the master account administrator permissions in the new member
    # account. Principals in the master account can assume the role. AWS
    # Organizations clones the company name and address information for the

    #
    # * When you create an account in an organization, the information
    #   required for the account to operate as a standalone account is *not*
    #   automatically collected. For example, information about the payment
    #   method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA) is not
    #   collected. If you must remove an account from your organization
    #   later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information.
    #   Follow the steps at [ To leave an organization as a member
    #   account][4] in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.

    # * If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your

    #
    # * If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed
    #   because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and
    #   then try again. If the error persists, contact [AWS Support][5].
    #
    # * Using `CreateAccount` to create multiple temporary accounts isn't
    #   recommended. You can only close an account from the Billing and Cost
    #   Management Console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For

    #   preconfigures in the new member accounts in both the AWS GovCloud (US)
    #   Region and in the commercial Region. This role trusts the master
    #   account, allowing users in the master account to assume the role, as
    #   permitted by the master account administrator. The role has
    #   administrator permissions in the new member account.
    #
    #   If you don't specify this parameter, the role name defaults to
