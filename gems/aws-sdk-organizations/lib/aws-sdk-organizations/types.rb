    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # * ACCOUNT\_CANNOT\_LEAVE\_ORGANIZATION: You attempted to remove the
    #   management account from the organization. You can't remove the
    #   management account. Instead, after you remove all member accounts,
    #   delete the organization itself.
    #
    # * ACCOUNT\_CANNOT\_LEAVE\_WITHOUT\_EULA: You attempted to remove an
    #   account from the organization that doesn't yet have enough
    #   information to exist as a standalone account. This account requires
    #   you to first agree to the AWS Customer Agreement. Follow the steps
    #   at [Removing a member account from your organization][1]in the *AWS
    #   Organizations User Guide.*
    #
    # * ACCOUNT\_CANNOT\_LEAVE\_WITHOUT\_PHONE\_VERIFICATION: You attempted
    #   to remove an account from the organization that doesn't yet have
    #   enough information to exist as a standalone account. This account
    #   requires you to first complete phone verification. Follow the steps
    #   at [Removing a member account from your organization][1] in the *AWS
    #   Organizations User Guide.*
    #
    # * ACCOUNT\_CREATION\_RATE\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED: You attempted to exceed
    #   the number of accounts that you can create in one day.
    #
    # * ACCOUNT\_NUMBER\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED: You attempted to exceed the limit
    #   on the number of accounts in an organization. If you need more
    #   accounts, contact [AWS Support][2] to request an increase in your
    #   limit.
    #
    #   Or the number of invitations that you tried to send would cause you
    #   to exceed the limit of accounts in your organization. Send fewer
    #   invitations or contact AWS Support to request an increase in the
    #   number of accounts.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Deleted and closed accounts still count toward your limit.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   If you get this exception when running a command immediately after
    #   creating the organization, wait one hour and try again. After an
    #   hour, if the command continues to fail with this error, contact [AWS
    #   Support][2].
    #
    # * CANNOT\_REGISTER\_MASTER\_AS\_DELEGATED\_ADMINISTRATOR: You
    #   attempted to register the management account of the organization as
    #   a delegated administrator for an AWS service integrated with

    #   delegated administrator.
    #
    # * CANNOT\_REMOVE\_DELEGATED\_ADMINISTRATOR\_FROM\_ORG: You attempted
    #   to remove an account that is registered as a delegated administrator
    #   for a service integrated with your organization. To complete this

    #   administrator.
    #
    # * CREATE\_ORGANIZATION\_IN\_BILLING\_MODE\_UNSUPPORTED\_REGION: To
    #   create an organization in the specified region, you must enable all
    #   features mode.
    #
    # * DELEGATED\_ADMINISTRATOR\_EXISTS\_FOR\_THIS\_SERVICE: You attempted
    #   to register an AWS account as a delegated administrator for an AWS
    #   service that already has a delegated administrator. To complete this
    #   operation, you must first deregister any existing delegated
    #   administrators for this service.
    #
    # * EMAIL\_VERIFICATION\_CODE\_EXPIRED: The email verification code is
    #   only valid for a limited period of time. You must resubmit the
    #   request and generate a new verfication code.
    #
    # * HANDSHAKE\_RATE\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED: You attempted to exceed the number
    #   of handshakes that you can send in one day.
    #
    # * MASTER\_ACCOUNT\_ADDRESS\_DOES\_NOT\_MATCH\_MARKETPLACE: To create
    #   an account in this organization, you first must migrate the
    #   organization's management account to the marketplace that
    #   corresponds to the management account's address. For example,
    #   accounts with India addresses must be associated with the AISPL
    #   marketplace. All accounts in an organization must be associated with
    #   the same marketplace.
    #
    # * MASTER\_ACCOUNT\_MISSING\_BUSINESS\_LICENSE: Applies only to the AWS
    #   Regions in China. To create an organization, the master must have a
    #   valid business license. For more information, contact customer
    #   support.
    #
    # * MASTER\_ACCOUNT\_MISSING\_CONTACT\_INFO: To complete this operation,

    #   the management account must have an associated account in the AWS
    #   GovCloud (US-West) Region. For more information, see [AWS
    #   Organizations][3] in the *AWS GovCloud User Guide.*
    #
    # * MASTER\_ACCOUNT\_PAYMENT\_INSTRUMENT\_REQUIRED: To create an
    #   organization with this management account, you first must associate
    #   a valid payment instrument, such as a credit card, with the account.
    #   Follow the steps at [To leave an organization when all required
    #   account information has not yet been provided][4] in the *AWS
    #   Organizations User Guide.*
    #
    # * MAX\_DELEGATED\_ADMINISTRATORS\_FOR\_SERVICE\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED: You
    #   attempted to register more delegated administrators than allowed for
    #   the service principal.
    #
    # * MAX\_POLICY\_TYPE\_ATTACHMENT\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED: You attempted to
    #   exceed the number of policies of a certain type that can be attached
    #   to an entity at one time.
    #
    # * MAX\_TAG\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED: You have exceeded the number of tags
    #   allowed on this resource.
    #
    # * MEMBER\_ACCOUNT\_PAYMENT\_INSTRUMENT\_REQUIRED: To complete this

    #   payment instrument, such as a credit card, with the account. Follow
    #   the steps at [To leave an organization when all required account
    #   information has not yet been provided][4] in the *AWS Organizations
    #   User Guide.*
    #
    # * MIN\_POLICY\_TYPE\_ATTACHMENT\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED: You attempted to
    #   detach a policy from an entity that would cause the entity to have
    #   fewer than the minimum number of policies of a certain type
    #   required.
    #
    # * ORGANIZATION\_NOT\_IN\_ALL\_FEATURES\_MODE: You attempted to perform
    #   an operation that requires the organization to be configured to
    #   support all features. An organization that supports only
    #   consolidated billing features can't perform this operation.
    #
    # * OU\_DEPTH\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED: You attempted to create an OU tree that
    #   is too many levels deep.
    #
    # * OU\_NUMBER\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED: You attempted to exceed the number of
    #   OUs that you can have in an organization.
    #
    # * POLICY\_CONTENT\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED: You attempted to create a policy
    #   that is larger than the maximum size.
    #
    # * POLICY\_NUMBER\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED: You attempted to exceed the number
    #   of policies that you can have in an organization.
    #
    # * TAG\_POLICY\_VIOLATION: You attempted to create or update a resource

    #     declined by the recipient account.

    #   * **ENABLE\_ALL\_FEATURES**\: This type of handshake represents a

    #     sent from the management account to only *invited* member
    #     accounts. Created accounts do not receive this because those
    #     accounts were created by the organization's management account
    #     and approval is inferred.

    #   continues to fail with this error, contact [AWS Support][1].
    #
    # * ALREADY\_IN\_AN\_ORGANIZATION: The handshake request is invalid
    #   because the invited account is already a member of an organization.
    #
    # * HANDSHAKE\_RATE\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED: You attempted to exceed the number
    #   of handshakes that you can send in one day.
    #
    # * INVITE\_DISABLED\_DURING\_ENABLE\_ALL\_FEATURES: You can't issue
    #   new invitations to join an organization while it's in the process
    #   of enabling all features. You can resume inviting accounts after you
    #   finalize the process when all accounts have agreed to the change.
    #
    # * ORGANIZATION\_ALREADY\_HAS\_ALL\_FEATURES: The handshake request is
    #   invalid because the organization has already enabled all features.
    #
    # * ORGANIZATION\_IS\_ALREADY\_PENDING\_ALL\_FEATURES\_MIGRATION: The
    #   handshake request is invalid because the organization has already
    #   started the process to enable all features.

    #
    # * DUPLICATE\_TAG\_KEY: Tag keys must be unique among the tags attached
    #   to the same entity.
    #
    # * IMMUTABLE\_POLICY: You specified a policy that is managed by AWS and
    #   can't be modified.
    #
    # * INPUT\_REQUIRED: You must include a value for all required
    #   parameters.
    #
    # * INVALID\_EMAIL\_ADDRESS\_TARGET: You specified an invalid email
    #   address for the invited account owner.
    #
    # * INVALID\_ENUM: You specified an invalid value.
    #
    # * INVALID\_ENUM\_POLICY\_TYPE: You specified an invalid policy type
    #   string.
    #
    # * INVALID\_FULL\_NAME\_TARGET: You specified a full name that contains
    #   invalid characters.
    #
    # * INVALID\_LIST\_MEMBER: You provided a list to a parameter that
    #   contains at least one invalid value.
    #
    # * INVALID\_PAGINATION\_TOKEN: Get the value for the `NextToken`
    #   parameter from the response to a previous call of the operation.
    #
    # * INVALID\_PARTY\_TYPE\_TARGET: You specified the wrong type of entity
    #   (account, organization, or email) as a party.
    #
    # * INVALID\_PATTERN: You provided a value that doesn't match the
    #   required pattern.
    #
    # * INVALID\_PATTERN\_TARGET\_ID: You specified a policy target ID that
    #   doesn't match the required pattern.
    #
    # * INVALID\_ROLE\_NAME: You provided a role name that isn't valid. A
    #   role name can't begin with the reserved prefix `AWSServiceRoleFor`.
    #
    # * INVALID\_SYNTAX\_ORGANIZATION\_ARN: You specified an invalid Amazon
    #   Resource Name (ARN) for the organization.
    #
    # * INVALID\_SYNTAX\_POLICY\_ID: You specified an invalid policy ID.
    #
    # * INVALID\_SYSTEM\_TAGS\_PARAMETER: You specified a tag key that is a
    #   system tag. You can’t add, edit, or delete system tag keys because
    #   they're reserved for AWS use. System tags don’t count against your
    #   tags per resource limit.
    #
    # * MAX\_FILTER\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED: You can specify only one filter
    #   parameter for the operation.
    #
    # * MAX\_LENGTH\_EXCEEDED: You provided a string parameter that is
    #   longer than allowed.
    #
    # * MAX\_VALUE\_EXCEEDED: You provided a numeric parameter that has a
    #   larger value than allowed.

    # * MIN\_LENGTH\_EXCEEDED: You provided a string parameter that is
    #   shorter than allowed.
    #
    # * MIN\_VALUE\_EXCEEDED: You provided a numeric parameter that has a
    #   smaller value than allowed.
    #
    # * MOVING\_ACCOUNT\_BETWEEN\_DIFFERENT\_ROOTS: You can move an account
    #   only between entities in the same root.
    #
    # * TARGET\_NOT\_SUPPORTED: You can't perform the specified operation
    #   on that target entity.
    #
    # * UNRECOGNIZED\_SERVICE\_PRINCIPAL: You specified a service principal
    #   that isn't recognized.
