# This module provides support for AWS Organizations. This module is available in the
# `aws-sdk-organizations` gem.
#
# # Client
#
# The {Client} class provides one method for each API operation. Operation
# methods each accept a hash of request parameters and return a response
# structure.
#
#     organizations = Aws::Organizations::Client.new
#     resp = organizations.accept_handshake(params)
#
# See {Client} for more information.
#
# # Errors
#
# Errors returned from AWS Organizations are defined in the
# {Errors} module and all extend {Errors::ServiceError}.
#
#     begin
#       # do stuff
#     rescue Aws::Organizations::Errors::ServiceError
#       # rescues all AWS Organizations API errors
