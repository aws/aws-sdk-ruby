    # @overload initialize(options)
    #   @param [Hash] options
    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading static credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleWebIdentityCredentials` - Used when you need to
    #       assume a role after providing credentials via the web.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SSOCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from AWS SSO using an
    #       access token generated from `aws login`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ProcessCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       process that outputs to stdout.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ECSCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from
    #       instances running in ECS.
    #
    #     * `Aws::CognitoIdentityCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from the Cognito Identity service.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2/ECS IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts
    #       are very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #       `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` or `Aws::ECSCredentials` to
    #       enable retries and extended timeouts. Instance profile credential
    #       fetching can be disabled by setting ENV['AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED']
    #       to true.

    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:region]`
    #     * `ENV['AWS_REGION']`
    #     * `ENV['AMAZON_REGION']`
    #     * `ENV['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION']`

    #     Used only in `adaptive` retry mode.  When true, the request will sleep
    #     until there is sufficent client side capacity to retry the request.
    #     When false, the request will raise a `RetryCapacityNotAvailableError` and will
    #     not retry instead of sleeping.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :client_side_monitoring (false)
    #     When `true`, client-side metrics will be collected for all API requests from

    #     The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #     ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #     are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #     checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors, auth errors,
    #     endpoint discovery, and errors from expired credentials.
    #     This option is only used in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_max_delay (0)
    #     The maximum number of seconds to delay between retries (0 for no limit)

    #       no retry mode is provided.
    #
    #     * `standard` - A standardized set of retry rules across the AWS SDKs.
    #       This includes support for retry quotas, which limit the number of
    #       unsuccessful retries a client can make.
    #
    #     * `adaptive` - An experimental retry mode that includes all the
    #       functionality of `standard` mode along with automatic client side
    #       throttling.  This is a provisional mode that may change behavior
    #       in the future.

    #     Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #     fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #     the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #     {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #     ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP

    #     When set to `true`, fips compatible endpoints will be used if available.
    #     When a `fips` region is used, the region is normalized and this config
    #     is set to `true`.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #     When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #     sending the request.
    #
    #   @option options [URI::HTTP,String] :http_proxy A proxy to send
    #     requests through.  Formatted like 'http://proxy.com:123'.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_open_timeout (15) The number of
    #     seconds to wait when opening a HTTP session before raising a
    #     `Timeout::Error`.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_read_timeout (60) The default
    #     number of seconds to wait for response data.  This value can
    #     safely be set per-request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_idle_timeout (5) The number of
    #     seconds a connection is allowed to sit idle before it is
    #     considered stale.  Stale connections are closed and removed
    #     from the pool before making a request.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_continue_timeout (1) The number of
    #     seconds to wait for a 100-continue response before sending the
    #     request body.  This option has no effect unless the request has
    #     "Expect" header set to "100-continue".  Defaults to `nil` which
    #     disables this behaviour.  This value can safely be set per
    #     request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :ssl_timeout (nil) Sets the SSL timeout
    #     in seconds.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :http_wire_trace (false) When `true`,

    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :ssl_verify_peer (true) When `true`,
    #     SSL peer certificates are verified when establishing a
    #     connection.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_bundle Full path to the SSL
    #     certificate authority bundle file that should be used when
    #     verifying peer certificates.  If you do not pass

    #     will be used if available.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_directory Full path of the
    #     directory that contains the unbundled SSL certificate
    #     authority files for verifying peer certificates.  If you do

    # Deletes the specified alarms. You can delete up to 100 alarms in one
    # operation. However, this total can include no more than one composite
    # alarm. For example, you could delete 99 metric alarms and one
    # composite alarms with one operation, but you can't delete two
    # composite alarms with one operation.
    #
    # In the event of an error, no alarms are deleted.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where
    # composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B
    # also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete
    # any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always
    # still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to
    # delete.
    #
    #  To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing
    # the rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a
    # dependency that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to
    # break a cycle is to change the `AlarmRule` of one of the alarms to
    # `False`.

    # You can use the `GetMetricData` API to retrieve as many as 500

    # 100,800 data points. You can also optionally perform math expressions
    # on the values of the returned statistics, to create new time series
    # that represent new insights into your data. For example, using Lambda
    # metrics, you could divide the Errors metric by the Invocations metric
    # to get an error rate time series. For more information about metric
    # math expressions, see [Metric Math Syntax and Functions][1] in the

    #
    # Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:
    #
    # * Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for
    #   3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are
    #   available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a
    #   `StorageResolution` of 1.
    #
    # * Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for
    #   15 days.
    #
    # * Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available
    #   for 63 days.
    #
    # * Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for
    #   455 days (15 months).
    #
    # Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are
    # aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect
    # data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15
    # days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still
    # available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of
    # 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is
    # available with a resolution of 1 hour.
    #
    # If you omit `Unit` in your request, all data that was collected with
    # any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were
    # specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a
    # unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that
    # unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data
    # collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not
    # perform unit conversions.

    #
    # @option params [required, Array<Types::MetricDataQuery>] :metric_data_queries
    #   The metric queries to be returned. A single `GetMetricData` call can
    #   include as many as 500 `MetricDataQuery` structures. Each of these
    #   structures can specify either a metric to retrieve, or a math
    #   expression to perform on retrieved data.
    #
    # @option params [required, Time,DateTime,Date,Integer,String] :start_time
    #   The time stamp indicating the earliest data to be returned.
    #
    #   The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the
    #   specified time stamp.
    #
    #   CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:
    #
    #   * Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole
    #     minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00.
    #
    #   * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest
    #     5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to
    #     12:30:00.
    #
    #   * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest
    #     1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to
    #     12:00:00.
    #
    #   If you set `Period` to 5, 10, or 30, the start time of your request is
    #   rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, or
    #   30-second divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at
    #   (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the previous 10-second period, the start time
    #   of your request is rounded down and you receive data from 01:05:10 to
    #   01:05:20. If you make a query at 15:07:17 for the previous 5 minutes
    #   of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped
    #   between 15:02:15 and 15:07:15.
    #
    #   For better performance, specify `StartTime` and `EndTime` values that
    #   align with the value of the metric's `Period` and sync up with the
    #   beginning and end of an hour. For example, if the `Period` of a metric
    #   is 5 minutes, specifying 12:05 or 12:30 as `StartTime` can get a
    #   faster response from CloudWatch than setting 12:07 or 12:29 as the
    #   `StartTime`.
    #
    # @option params [required, Time,DateTime,Date,Integer,String] :end_time
    #   The time stamp indicating the latest data to be returned.
    #
    #   The value specified is exclusive; results include data points up to
    #   the specified time stamp.

    #   operation, to get the next set of data points.
    #

    # CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period
    # that you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a
    # one-hour period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time
    # stamps that fall within each one-hour period. Therefore, the number of
    # values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data
    # points returned.
    #
    # CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics.

    # retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following
    # conditions is true:
    #

    #
    # @option params [required, Time,DateTime,Date,Integer,String] :start_time
    #   The time stamp that determines the first data point to return. Start
    #   times are evaluated relative to the time that CloudWatch receives the
    #   request.
    #
    #   The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the
    #   specified time stamp. In a raw HTTP query, the time stamp must be in
    #   ISO 8601 UTC format (for example, 2016-10-03T23:00:00Z).
    #
    #   CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:
    #
    #   * Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole
    #     minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00.
    #
    #   * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest
    #     5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to
    #     12:30:00.
    #
    #   * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest
    #     1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to
    #     12:00:00.
    #
    #   If you set `Period` to 5, 10, or 30, the start time of your request is
    #   rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, or
    #   30-second divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at
    #   (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the previous 10-second period, the start time
    #   of your request is rounded down and you receive data from 01:05:10 to

    #   of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped
    #   between 15:02:15 and 15:07:15.
    #
    # @option params [required, Time,DateTime,Date,Integer,String] :end_time
    #   The time stamp that determines the last data point to return.
    #
    #   The value specified is exclusive; results include data points up to
    #   the specified time stamp. In a raw HTTP query, the time stamp must be
    #   in ISO 8601 UTC format (for example, 2016-10-10T23:00:00Z).
    #
    # @option params [required, Integer] :period
    #   The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics
    #   with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60
    #   seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics
    #   that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period
    #   can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution
    #   metrics are those metrics stored by a `PutMetricData` call that
    #   includes a `StorageResolution` of 1 second.
    #
    #   If the `StartTime` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater
    #   than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data
    #   points in that time range is returned:
    #
    #   * Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60
    #     seconds (1 minute).
    #
    #   * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300
    #     seconds (5 minutes).
    #
    #   * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds
    #     (1 hour).
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :statistics
    #   The metric statistics, other than percentile. For percentile
    #   statistics, use `ExtendedStatistics`. When calling
    #   `GetMetricStatistics`, you must specify either `Statistics` or
    #   `ExtendedStatistics`, but not both.
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :extended_statistics
    #   The percentile statistics. Specify values between p0.0 and p100. When
    #   calling `GetMetricStatistics`, you must specify either `Statistics` or
    #   `ExtendedStatistics`, but not both. Percentile statistics are not
    #   available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative
    #   numbers.
    #
    # @option params [String] :unit
    #   The unit for a given metric. If you omit `Unit`, all data that was
    #   collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding
    #   units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If

    # features, including metric math and horizontal and vertical
    # annotations.
    #
    # There is a limit of 20 transactions per second for this API. Each
    # `GetMetricWidgetImage` action has the following limits:
    #
    # * As many as 100 metrics in the graph.
    #
    # * Up to 100 KB uncompressed payload.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :metric_widget
    #   A JSON string that defines the bitmap graph to be retrieved. The
    #   string includes the metrics to include in the graph, statistics,
    #   annotations, title, axis limits, and so on. You can include only one
    #   `MetricWidget` parameter in each `GetMetricWidgetImage` call.
    #
    #   For more information about the syntax of `MetricWidget` see
    #   [GetMetricWidgetImage: Metric Widget Structure and Syntax][1].
    #
    #   If any metric on the graph could not load all the requested data

    #   The format of the resulting image. Only PNG images are supported.

    #   response with the content-type set to `text/xml`. The image data is in
    #   a `MetricWidgetImage` field. For example:
    #
    #   ` <GetMetricWidgetImageResponse xmlns=<URLstring>>`
    #
    #   ` <GetMetricWidgetImageResult>`

    #   ` <MetricWidgetImage>`

    # Creates or updates a *composite alarm*. When you create a composite
    # alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into
    # account the alarm states of other alarms that you have created. The
    # composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all conditions of the
    # rule are met.
    #
    # The alarms specified in a composite alarm's rule expression can
    # include metric alarms and other composite alarms.
    #
    # Using composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple
    # metric alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts
    # only for the composite alarm. For example, you could create a
    # composite alarm that goes into ALARM state only when more than one of
    # the underlying metric alarms are in ALARM state.
    #
    # Currently, the only alarm actions that can be taken by composite
    # alarms are notifying SNS topics.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where
    # composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B
    # also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete
    # any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always
    # still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to
    # delete.
    #
    #  To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing
    # the rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a
    # dependency that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to
    # break a cycle is to change the `AlarmRule` of one of the alarms to
    # `False`.
    #
    #  Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch
    # detects a cycle in the evaluation path.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately
    # set to `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`. The alarm is then evaluated and its state
    # is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are
    # then executed. For a composite alarm, this initial time after creation
    # is the only time that the alarm can be in `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state.
    #
    # When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but
    # the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the
    # alarm.
    #
    # To use this operation, you must be signed on with the
    # `cloudwatch:PutCompositeAlarm` permission that is scoped to `*`. You
    # can't create a composite alarms if your
    # `cloudwatch:PutCompositeAlarm` permission has a narrower scope.
    #
    # If you are an IAM user, you must have `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` to
    # create a composite alarm that has Systems Manager OpsItem actions.
    #
    # @option params [Boolean] :actions_enabled
    #   Indicates whether actions should be executed during any changes to the

    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :alarm_actions
    #   The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the `ALARM`
    #   state from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon
    #   Resource Name (ARN).
    #
    #   Valid Values: `arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:sns-topic-name ` \|
    #   `arn:aws:ssm:region:account-id:opsitem:severity `
    #
    # @option params [String] :alarm_description
    #   The description for the composite alarm.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :alarm_name
    #   The name for the composite alarm. This name must be unique within the
    #   Region.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :alarm_rule
    #   An expression that specifies which other alarms are to be evaluated to
    #   determine this composite alarm's state. For each alarm that you
    #   reference, you designate a function that specifies whether that alarm
    #   needs to be in ALARM state, OK state, or INSUFFICIENT\_DATA state. You
    #   can use operators (AND, OR and NOT) to combine multiple functions in a
    #   single expression. You can use parenthesis to logically group the
    #   functions in your expression.
    #
    #   You can use either alarm names or ARNs to reference the other alarms
    #   that are to be evaluated.
    #
    #   Functions can include the following:
    #
    #   * `ALARM("alarm-name or alarm-ARN")` is TRUE if the named alarm is in
    #     ALARM state.
    #
    #   * `OK("alarm-name or alarm-ARN")` is TRUE if the named alarm is in OK
    #     state.
    #
    #   * `INSUFFICIENT_DATA("alarm-name or alarm-ARN")` is TRUE if the named
    #     alarm is in INSUFFICIENT\_DATA state.
    #
    #   * `TRUE` always evaluates to TRUE.
    #
    #   * `FALSE` always evaluates to FALSE.
    #
    #   TRUE and FALSE are useful for testing a complex `AlarmRule` structure,
    #   and for testing your alarm actions.
    #
    #   Alarm names specified in `AlarmRule` can be surrounded with
    #   double-quotes ("), but do not have to be.
    #
    #   The following are some examples of `AlarmRule`\:
    #
    #   * `ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh)`
    #     specifies that the composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if
    #     both CPUUtilizationTooHigh and DiskReadOpsTooHigh alarms are in
    #     ALARM state.
    #
    #   * `ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND NOT ALARM(DeploymentInProgress)`
    #     specifies that the alarm goes to ALARM state if
    #     CPUUtilizationTooHigh is in ALARM state and DeploymentInProgress is
    #     not in ALARM state. This example reduces alarm noise during a known
    #     deployment window.
    #
    #   * `(ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) OR ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh)) AND
    #     OK(NetworkOutTooHigh)` goes into ALARM state if
    #     CPUUtilizationTooHigh OR DiskReadOpsTooHigh is in ALARM state, and
    #     if NetworkOutTooHigh is in OK state. This provides another example
    #     of using a composite alarm to prevent noise. This rule ensures that
    #     you are not notified with an alarm action on high CPU or disk usage
    #     if a known network problem is also occurring.
    #
    #   The `AlarmRule` can specify as many as 100 "children" alarms. The
    #   `AlarmRule` expression can have as many as 500 elements. Elements are
    #   child alarms, TRUE or FALSE statements, and parentheses.
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :insufficient_data_actions
    #   The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the
    #   `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state from any other state. Each action is
    #   specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
    #
    #   Valid Values: `arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:sns-topic-name `
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :ok_actions
    #   The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to an `OK` state

    # @option params [String] :metric_name
    #   The name for the metric associated with the alarm. For each
    #   `PutMetricAlarm` operation, you must specify either `MetricName` or a
    #   `Metrics` array.
    #
    #   If you are creating an alarm based on a math expression, you cannot
    #   specify this parameter, or any of the `Dimensions`, `Period`,
    #   `Namespace`, `Statistic`, or `ExtendedStatistic` parameters. Instead,
    #   you specify all this information in the `Metrics` array.
    #
    # @option params [String] :namespace
    #   The namespace for the metric associated specified in `MetricName`.
    #
    # @option params [String] :statistic
    #   The statistic for the metric specified in `MetricName`, other than
    #   percentile. For percentile statistics, use `ExtendedStatistic`. When
    #   you call `PutMetricAlarm` and specify a `MetricName`, you must specify
    #   either `Statistic` or `ExtendedStatistic,` but not both.
    #
    # @option params [String] :extended_statistic
    #   The percentile statistic for the metric specified in `MetricName`.
    #   Specify a value between p0.0 and p100. When you call `PutMetricAlarm`
    #   and specify a `MetricName`, you must specify either `Statistic` or
    #   `ExtendedStatistic,` but not both.
    #
    # @option params [Array<Types::Dimension>] :dimensions
    #   The dimensions for the metric specified in `MetricName`.
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :period
    #   The length, in seconds, used each time the metric specified in
    #   `MetricName` is evaluated. Valid values are 10, 30, and any multiple
    #   of 60.
    #
    #   `Period` is required for alarms based on static thresholds. If you are
    #   creating an alarm based on a metric math expression, you specify the
    #   period for each metric within the objects in the `Metrics` array.
    #
    #   Be sure to specify 10 or 30 only for metrics that are stored by a
    #   `PutMetricData` call with a `StorageResolution` of 1. If you specify a
    #   period of 10 or 30 for a metric that does not have sub-minute
    #   resolution, the alarm still attempts to gather data at the period rate
    #   that you specify. In this case, it does not receive data for the
    #   attempts that do not correspond to a one-minute data resolution, and
    #   the alarm might often lapse into INSUFFICENT\_DATA status. Specifying
    #   10 or 30 also sets this alarm as a high-resolution alarm, which has a
    #   higher charge than other alarms. For more information about pricing,
    #   see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing][1].
    #
    #   An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no longer than one
    #   day, so `Period` multiplied by `EvaluationPeriods` cannot be more than
    #   86,400 seconds.
    #
    #
    #
    #   [1]: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/
    #
    # @option params [String] :unit
    #   The unit of measure for the statistic. For example, the units for the
    #   Amazon EC2 NetworkIn metric are Bytes because NetworkIn tracks the
    #   number of bytes that an instance receives on all network interfaces.
    #   You can also specify a unit when you create a custom metric. Units
    #   help provide conceptual meaning to your data. Metric data points that
    #   specify a unit of measure, such as Percent, are aggregated separately.
    #
    #   If you don't specify `Unit`, CloudWatch retrieves all unit types that
    #   have been published for the metric and attempts to evaluate the alarm.
    #   Usually, metrics are published with only one unit, so the alarm works
    #   as intended.
    #
    #   However, if the metric is published with multiple types of units and
    #   you don't specify a unit, the alarm's behavior is not defined and it
    #   behaves predictably.
    #
    #   We recommend omitting `Unit` so that you don't inadvertently specify
    #   an incorrect unit that is not published for this metric. Doing so
    #   causes the alarm to be stuck in the `INSUFFICIENT DATA` state.
    #
    # @option params [required, Integer] :evaluation_periods
    #   The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified
    #   threshold. If you are setting an alarm that requires that a number of
    #   consecutive data points be breaching to trigger the alarm, this value
    #   specifies that number. If you are setting an "M out of N" alarm,
    #   this value is the N.
    #
    #   An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no longer than one
    #   day, so this number multiplied by `Period` cannot be more than 86,400
    #   seconds.
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :datapoints_to_alarm
    #   The number of data points that must be breaching to trigger the alarm.
    #   This is used only if you are setting an "M out of N" alarm. In that
    #   case, this value is the M. For more information, see [Evaluating an
    #   Alarm][1] in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

    #
    # @option params [Float] :threshold
    #   The value against which the specified statistic is compared.
    #
    #   This parameter is required for alarms based on static thresholds, but
    #   should not be used for alarms based on anomaly detection models.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :comparison_operator
    #   The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic
    #   and threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the first
    #   operand.
    #
    #   The values `LessThanLowerOrGreaterThanUpperThreshold`,
    #   `LessThanLowerThreshold`, and `GreaterThanUpperThreshold` are used
    #   only for alarms based on anomaly detection models.
    #
    # @option params [String] :treat_missing_data
    #   Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. If
    #   `TreatMissingData` is omitted, the default behavior of `missing` is
    #   used. For more information, see [Configuring How CloudWatch Alarms
    #   Treats Missing Data][1].

    #
    # @option params [String] :evaluate_low_sample_count_percentile
    #   Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If you specify `ignore`,
    #   the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data
    #   points to be statistically significant. If you specify `evaluate` or
    #   omit this parameter, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly
    #   changes state no matter how many data points are available. For more
    #   information, see [Percentile-Based CloudWatch Alarms and Low Data
    #   Samples][1].

    # @option params [Array<Types::MetricDataQuery>] :metrics
    #   An array of `MetricDataQuery` structures that enable you to create an
    #   alarm based on the result of a metric math expression. For each
    #   `PutMetricAlarm` operation, you must specify either `MetricName` or a
    #   `Metrics` array.
    #
    #   Each item in the `Metrics` array either retrieves a metric or performs
    #   a math expression.
    #
    #   One item in the `Metrics` array is the expression that the alarm
    #   watches. You designate this expression by setting `ReturnData` to true
    #   for this object in the array. For more information, see
    #   [MetricDataQuery][1].
    #
    #   If you use the `Metrics` parameter, you cannot include the
    #   `MetricName`, `Dimensions`, `Period`, `Namespace`, `Statistic`, or
    #   `ExtendedStatistic` parameters of `PutMetricAlarm` in the same
    #   operation. Instead, you retrieve the metrics you are using in your
    #   math expression as part of the `Metrics` array.

    #   [1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_MetricDataQuery.html
    #
    # @option params [Array<Types::Tag>] :tags
    #   A list of key-value pairs to associate with the alarm. You can
    #   associate as many as 50 tags with an alarm.
    #
    #   Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also
    #   use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to
    #   access or change only resources with certain tag values.
    #
    #   If you are using this operation to update an existing alarm, any tags
    #   you specify in this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of an
    #   existing alarm, use [TagResource][1] or [UntagResource][2].

    # @option params [String] :threshold_metric_id
    #   If this is an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, make this
    #   value match the ID of the `ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND` function.
    #
    #   For an example of how to use this parameter, see the **Anomaly

    #
    # You can publish either individual data points in the `Value` field, or
    # arrays of values and the number of times each value occurred during
    # the period by using the `Values` and `Counts` fields in the
    # `MetricDatum` structure. Using the `Values` and `Counts` method
    # enables you to publish up to 150 values per metric with one

    # on this data.
    #
    # Each `PutMetricData` request is limited to 40 KB in size for HTTP POST
    # requests. You can send a payload compressed by gzip. Each request is
    # also limited to no more than 20 different metrics.
    #
    # Although the `Value` parameter accepts numbers of type `Double`,

    # values (for example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are not supported.
    #
    # You can use up to 10 dimensions per metric to further clarify what

    #   The ARN of an IAM role that this metric stream will use to access
    #   Amazon Kinesis Firehose resources. This IAM role must already exist
    #   and must be in the same account as the metric stream. This IAM role
    #   must include the following permissions:
    #
    #   * firehose:PutRecord
    #
    #   * firehose:PutRecordBatch
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :output_format
    #   The output format for the stream. Valid values are `json` and
    #   `opentelemetry0.7`. For more information about metric stream output
    #   formats, see [ Metric streams output formats][1].

    # @option params [Array<Types::Tag>] :tags
    #   A list of key-value pairs to associate with the metric stream. You can
    #   associate as many as 50 tags with a metric stream.
    #
    #   Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also
    #   use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to
    #   access or change only resources with certain tag values.
    #
    #   You can use this parameter only when you are creating a new metric
    #   stream. If you are using this operation to update an existing metric
    #   stream, any tags you specify in this parameter are ignored. To change
    #   the tags of an existing metric stream, use [TagResource][1] or
    #   [UntagResource][2].

    # Polls an API operation until a resource enters a desired state.
    #
    # ## Basic Usage
    #
    # A waiter will call an API operation until:
    #
    # * It is successful
    # * It enters a terminal state
    # * It makes the maximum number of attempts
    #
    # In between attempts, the waiter will sleep.
    #
    #     # polls in a loop, sleeping between attempts
    #     client.wait_until(waiter_name, params)
    #
    # ## Configuration
    #
    # You can configure the maximum number of polling attempts, and the
    # delay (in seconds) between each polling attempt. You can pass
    # configuration as the final arguments hash.
    #
    #     # poll for ~25 seconds
    #     client.wait_until(waiter_name, params, {
    #       max_attempts: 5,
    #       delay: 5,
    #     })
    #
    # ## Callbacks
    #
    # You can be notified before each polling attempt and before each
    # delay. If you throw `:success` or `:failure` from these callbacks,
    # it will terminate the waiter.
    #
    #     started_at = Time.now
    #     client.wait_until(waiter_name, params, {
    #
    #       # disable max attempts
    #       max_attempts: nil,
    #
    #       # poll for 1 hour, instead of a number of attempts
    #       before_wait: -> (attempts, response) do
    #         throw :failure if Time.now - started_at > 3600
    #       end
    #     })
    #
    # ## Handling Errors
    #
    # When a waiter is unsuccessful, it will raise an error.
    # All of the failure errors extend from
    # {Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed}.
    #
    #     begin
    #       client.wait_until(...)
    #     rescue Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed
    #       # resource did not enter the desired state in time
    #     end
    #
    # ## Valid Waiters
    #
    # The following table lists the valid waiter names, the operations they call,
    # and the default `:delay` and `:max_attempts` values.
    #
