    # @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #   Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #   following classes:
    #
    #   * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #     credentials.
    #
    #   * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #     from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #   * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #     shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #   * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #   When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #   locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #   * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #   * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #   * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #   * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #   * `~/.aws/config`
    #   * EC2 IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts are
    #     very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #     `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` to enable retries and extended
    #     timeouts.
    #
    # @option options [required, String] :region
    #   The AWS region to connect to.  The configured `:region` is
    #   used to determine the service `:endpoint`. When not passed,
    #   a default `:region` is search for in the following locations:
    #
    #   * `Aws.config[:region]`
    #   * `ENV['AWS_REGION']`
    #   * `ENV['AMAZON_REGION']`
    #   * `ENV['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION']`
    #   * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #   * `~/.aws/config`
    #
    # @option options [String] :access_key_id
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :convert_params (true)
    #   When `true`, an attempt is made to coerce request parameters into
    #   the required types.
    #
    # @option options [String] :endpoint
    #   The client endpoint is normally constructed from the `:region`
    #   option. You should only configure an `:endpoint` when connecting
    #   to test endpoints. This should be avalid HTTP(S) URI.
    #
    # @option options [Aws::Log::Formatter] :log_formatter (Aws::Log::Formatter.default)
    #   The log formatter.
    #
    # @option options [Symbol] :log_level (:info)
    #   The log level to send messages to the `:logger` at.
    #
    # @option options [Logger] :logger
    #   The Logger instance to send log messages to.  If this option
    #   is not set, logging will be disabled.
    #
    # @option options [String] :profile ("default")
    #   Used when loading credentials from the shared credentials file
    #   at HOME/.aws/credentials.  When not specified, 'default' is used.
    #
    # @option options [Integer] :retry_limit (3)
    #   The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #   ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #   are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #   checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors and auth
    #   errors from expired credentials.
    #
    # @option options [String] :secret_access_key
    #
    # @option options [String] :session_token
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #   Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #   fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #   the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #   {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #   ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #   requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #   When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #   sending the request.

    # Gets statistics for the specified metric.
    #
    # The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is
    # 1,440. If you request more than 1,440 data points, CloudWatch returns
    # an error. To reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the
    # specified time range and make multiple requests across adjacent time
    # ranges, or you can increase the specified period. Data points are not
    # returned in chronological order.
    #
    # CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period
    # that you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a
    # one-hour period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time
    # stamps that fall within each one-hour period. Therefore, the number of
    # values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data
    # points returned.
    #
    # CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics.
    # If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only
    # retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following
    # conditions is true:
    #
    # * The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1.
    #
    # * The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal.
    #
    # Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:
    #
    # * Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for
    #   3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are
    #   available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a
    #   `StorageResolution` of 1.
    #
    # * Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for
    #   15 days.
    #
    # * Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available
    #   for 63 days.
    #
    # * Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for
    #   455 days (15 months).
    #
    # Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are
    # aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect
    # data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15
    # days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still
    # available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of
    # 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is
    # available with a resolution of 1 hour.
    #
    # CloudWatch started retaining 5-minute and 1-hour metric data as of
    # July 9, 2016.

    #
    # @option params [required, String] :namespace
    #   The namespace of the metric, with or without spaces.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :metric_name
    #   The name of the metric, with or without spaces.
    #
    # @option params [Array<Types::Dimension>] :dimensions
    #   The dimensions. If the metric contains multiple dimensions, you must
    #   include a value for each dimension. CloudWatch treats each unique
    #   combination of dimensions as a separate metric. If a specific
    #   combination of dimensions was not published, you can't retrieve
    #   statistics for it. You must specify the same dimensions that were used
    #   when the metrics were created. For an example, see [Dimension
    #   Combinations][1] in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*. For more
    #   information about specifying dimensions, see [Publishing Metrics][2]

    #
    # @option params [required, Time,DateTime,Date,Integer,String] :start_time
    #   The time stamp that determines the first data point to return. Start
    #   times are evaluated relative to the time that CloudWatch receives the
    #   request.
    #
    #   The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the
    #   specified time stamp. The time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format
    #   (for example, 2016-10-03T23:00:00Z).
    #
    #   CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:
    #
    #   * Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole
    #     minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00.
    #
    #   * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest
    #     5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to
    #     12:30:00.
    #
    #   * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest
    #     1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to
    #     12:00:00.
    #
    #   If you set `Period` to 5, 10, or 30, the start time of your request is
    #   rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, or
    #   30-second divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at
    #   (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the previous 10-second period, the start time
    #   of your request is rounded down and you receive data from 01:05:10 to
    #   01:05:20. If you make a query at 15:07:17 for the previous 5 minutes
    #   of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped
    #   between 15:02:15 and 15:07:15.
    #
    # @option params [required, Time,DateTime,Date,Integer,String] :end_time
    #   The time stamp that determines the last data point to return.
    #
    #   The value specified is exclusive; results include data points up to
    #   the specified time stamp. The time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC
    #   format (for example, 2016-10-10T23:00:00Z).
    #
    # @option params [required, Integer] :period
    #   The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics
    #   with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60
    #   seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics
    #   that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period
    #   can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution
    #   metrics are those metrics stored by a `PutMetricData` call that
    #   includes a `StorageResolution` of 1 second.
    #
    #   If the `StartTime` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater
    #   than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data
    #   points in that time range is returned:
    #
    #   * Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60
    #     seconds (1 minute).
    #
    #   * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300
    #     seconds (5 minutes).
    #
    #   * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds
    #     (1 hour).
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :statistics
    #   The metric statistics, other than percentile. For percentile
    #   statistics, use `ExtendedStatistics`. When calling
    #   `GetMetricStatistics`, you must specify either `Statistics` or
    #   `ExtendedStatistics`, but not both.
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :extended_statistics
    #   The percentile statistics. Specify values between p0.0 and p100. When
    #   calling `GetMetricStatistics`, you must specify either `Statistics` or
    #   `ExtendedStatistics`, but not both.
    #
    # @option params [String] :unit
    #   The unit for a given metric. Metrics may be reported in multiple
    #   units. Not supplying a unit results in all units being returned. If
    #   the metric only ever reports one unit, specifying a unit has no
    #   effect.

    # When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately
    # set to `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`. The alarm is evaluated and its state is
    # set appropriately. Any actions associated with the state are then

    # @option params [required, String] :metric_name
    #   The name for the metric associated with the alarm.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :namespace
    #   The namespace for the metric associated with the alarm.
    #
    # @option params [String] :statistic
    #   The statistic for the metric associated with the alarm, other than
    #   percentile. For percentile statistics, use `ExtendedStatistic`. When
    #   you call `PutMetricAlarm`, you must specify either `Statistic` or
    #   `ExtendedStatistic,` but not both.
    #
    # @option params [String] :extended_statistic
    #   The percentile statistic for the metric associated with the alarm.
    #   Specify a value between p0.0 and p100. When you call `PutMetricAlarm`,
    #   you must specify either `Statistic` or `ExtendedStatistic,` but not
    #   both.
    #
    # @option params [Array<Types::Dimension>] :dimensions
    #   The dimensions for the metric associated with the alarm.
    #
    # @option params [required, Integer] :period
    #   The period, in seconds, over which the specified statistic is applied.
    #   Valid values are 10, 30, and any multiple of 60.
    #
    #   Be sure to specify 10 or 30 only for metrics that are stored by a
    #   `PutMetricData` call with a `StorageResolution` of 1. If you specify a
    #   Period of 10 or 30 for a metric that does not have sub-minute
    #   resolution, the alarm still attempts to gather data at the period rate
    #   that you specify. In this case, it does not receive data for the
    #   attempts that do not correspond to a one-minute data resolution, and
    #   the alarm may often lapse into INSUFFICENT\_DATA status. Specifying 10
    #   or 30 also sets this alarm as a high-resolution alarm, which has a
    #   higher charge than other alarms. For more information about pricing,
    #   see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing][1].
    #
    #   An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no longer than one
    #   day, so `Period` multiplied by `EvaluationPeriods` cannot be more than
    #   86,400 seconds.
    #
    #
    #
    #   [1]: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/
    #
    # @option params [String] :unit
    #   The unit of measure for the statistic. For example, the units for the
    #   Amazon EC2 NetworkIn metric are Bytes because NetworkIn tracks the
    #   number of bytes that an instance receives on all network interfaces.
    #   You can also specify a unit when you create a custom metric. Units
    #   help provide conceptual meaning to your data. Metric data points that
    #   specify a unit of measure, such as Percent, are aggregated separately.
    #
    #   If you specify a unit, you must use a unit that is appropriate for the
    #   metric. Otherwise, the CloudWatch alarm can get stuck in the
    #   `INSUFFICIENT DATA` state.
    #
    # @option params [required, Integer] :evaluation_periods
    #   The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified
    #   threshold. An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no
    #   longer than one day, so this number multiplied by `Period` cannot be
    #   more than 86,400 seconds.
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :datapoints_to_alarm
    #   The number of datapoints that must be breaching to trigger the alarm.
    #
    # @option params [required, Float] :threshold
    #   The value against which the specified statistic is compared.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :comparison_operator
    #   The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic
    #   and threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the first
    #   operand.
    #
    # @option params [String] :treat_missing_data
    #   Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. If
    #   `TreatMissingData` is omitted, the default behavior of `missing` is
    #   used. For more information, see [Configuring How CloudWatch Alarms
    #   Treats Missing Data][1].
    #
    #   Valid Values: `breaching | notBreaching | ignore | missing`
    #
    #
    #
    #   [1]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarms-and-missing-data
    #
    # @option params [String] :evaluate_low_sample_count_percentile
    #   Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If you specify `ignore`,
    #   the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data
    #   points to be statistically significant. If you specify `evaluate` or
    #   omit this parameter, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly
    #   changes state no matter how many data points are available. For more
    #   information, see [Percentile-Based CloudWatch Alarms and Low Data
    #   Samples][1].

    # Polls an API operation until a resource enters a desired state.
    #
    # ## Basic Usage
    #
    # A waiter will call an API operation until:
    #
    # * It is successful
    # * It enters a terminal state
    # * It makes the maximum number of attempts
    #
    # In between attempts, the waiter will sleep.
    #
    #     # polls in a loop, sleeping between attempts
    #     client.waiter_until(waiter_name, params)
    #
    # ## Configuration
    #
    # You can configure the maximum number of polling attempts, and the
    # delay (in seconds) between each polling attempt. You can pass
    # configuration as the final arguments hash.
    #
    #     # poll for ~25 seconds
    #     client.wait_until(waiter_name, params, {
    #       max_attempts: 5,
    #       delay: 5,
    #     })
    #
    # ## Callbacks
    #
    # You can be notified before each polling attempt and before each
    # delay. If you throw `:success` or `:failure` from these callbacks,
    # it will terminate the waiter.
    #
    #     started_at = Time.now
    #     client.wait_until(waiter_name, params, {
    #
    #       # disable max attempts
    #       max_attempts: nil,
    #
    #       # poll for 1 hour, instead of a number of attempts
    #       before_wait: -> (attempts, response) do
    #         throw :failure if Time.now - started_at > 3600
    #       end
    #     })
    #
    # ## Handling Errors
    #
    # When a waiter is unsuccessful, it will raise an error.
    # All of the failure errors extend from
    # {Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed}.
    #
    #     begin
    #       client.wait_until(...)
    #     rescue Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed
    #       # resource did not enter the desired state in time
    #     end

    # and the default `:delay` and `:max_attempts` values.
