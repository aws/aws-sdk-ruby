    # @deprecated Use [Aws::CloudWatch::Client] #wait_until instead
    #
    # Waiter polls an API operation until a resource enters a desired
    # state.
    #
    # @note The waiting operation is performed on a copy. The original resource
    #   remains unchanged.
    #
    # ## Basic Usage
    #
    # Waiter will polls until it is successful, it fails by
    # entering a terminal state, or until a maximum number of attempts
    # are made.
    #
    #     # polls in a loop until condition is true
    #     resource.wait_until(options) {|resource| condition}
    #
    # ## Example
    #
    #     instance.wait_until(max_attempts:10, delay:5) do |instance|
    #       instance.state.name == 'running'
    #     end
    #
    # ## Configuration
    #
    # You can configure the maximum number of polling attempts, and the
    # delay (in seconds) between each polling attempt. The waiting condition is
    # set by passing a block to {#wait_until}:
    #
    #     # poll for ~25 seconds
    #     resource.wait_until(max_attempts:5,delay:5) {|resource|...}
    #
    # ## Callbacks
    #
    # You can be notified before each polling attempt and before each
    # delay. If you throw `:success` or `:failure` from these callbacks,
    # it will terminate the waiter.
    #
    #     started_at = Time.now
    #     # poll for 1 hour, instead of a number of attempts
    #     proc = Proc.new do |attempts, response|
    #       throw :failure if Time.now - started_at > 3600
    #     end
    #
    #       # disable max attempts
    #     instance.wait_until(before_wait:proc, max_attempts:nil) {...}
    #
    # ## Handling Errors
    #
    # When a waiter is successful, it returns the Resource. When a waiter
    # fails, it raises an error.
    #
    #     begin
    #       resource.wait_until(...)
    #     rescue Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed

    #   The dimensions. If the metric contains multiple dimensions, you must
    #   include a value for each dimension. CloudWatch treats each unique
    #   combination of dimensions as a separate metric. If a specific
    #   combination of dimensions was not published, you can't retrieve
    #   statistics for it. You must specify the same dimensions that were used
    #   when the metrics were created. For an example, see [Dimension
    #   Combinations][1] in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*. For more
    #   information about specifying dimensions, see [Publishing Metrics][2]
    #   in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

    # @option options [required, Time,DateTime,Date,Integer,String] :start_time
    #   The time stamp that determines the first data point to return. Start
    #   times are evaluated relative to the time that CloudWatch receives the
    #   request.
    #
    #   The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the
    #   specified time stamp. In a raw HTTP query, the time stamp must be in
    #   ISO 8601 UTC format (for example, 2016-10-03T23:00:00Z).
    #
    #   CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:
    #
    #   * Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole
    #     minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00.
    #
    #   * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest
    #     5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to
    #     12:30:00.
    #
    #   * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest
    #     1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to
    #     12:00:00.
    #
    #   If you set `Period` to 5, 10, or 30, the start time of your request is
    #   rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, or
    #   30-second divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at
    #   (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the previous 10-second period, the start time
    #   of your request is rounded down and you receive data from 01:05:10 to
    #   01:05:20. If you make a query at 15:07:17 for the previous 5 minutes
    #   of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped
    #   between 15:02:15 and 15:07:15.
    # @option options [required, Time,DateTime,Date,Integer,String] :end_time
    #   The time stamp that determines the last data point to return.
    #
    #   The value specified is exclusive; results include data points up to
    #   the specified time stamp. In a raw HTTP query, the time stamp must be
    #   in ISO 8601 UTC format (for example, 2016-10-10T23:00:00Z).
    # @option options [required, Integer] :period
    #   The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics
    #   with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60
    #   seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics
    #   that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period
    #   can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution
    #   metrics are those metrics stored by a `PutMetricData` call that
    #   includes a `StorageResolution` of 1 second.
    #
    #   If the `StartTime` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater
    #   than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data
    #   points in that time range is returned:
    #
    #   * Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60
    #     seconds (1 minute).
    #
    #   * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300
    #     seconds (5 minutes).
    #
    #   * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds
    #     (1 hour).
    # @option options [Array<String>] :statistics
    #   The metric statistics, other than percentile. For percentile
    #   statistics, use `ExtendedStatistics`. When calling
    #   `GetMetricStatistics`, you must specify either `Statistics` or
    #   `ExtendedStatistics`, but not both.
    # @option options [Array<String>] :extended_statistics
    #   The percentile statistics. Specify values between p0.0 and p100. When
    #   calling `GetMetricStatistics`, you must specify either `Statistics` or
    #   `ExtendedStatistics`, but not both. Percentile statistics are not
    #   available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative
    #   numbers.
    # @option options [String] :unit
    #   The unit for a given metric. If you omit `Unit`, all data that was
    #   collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding
    #   units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If
    #   you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected
    #   with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match

    #   The percentile statistic for the metric specified in `MetricName`.
    #   Specify a value between p0.0 and p100. When you call `PutMetricAlarm`
    #   and specify a `MetricName`, you must specify either `Statistic` or

    #   The dimensions for the metric specified in `MetricName`.
    # @option options [Integer] :period
    #   The length, in seconds, used each time the metric specified in
    #   `MetricName` is evaluated. Valid values are 10, 30, and any multiple
    #   of 60.
    #
    #   `Period` is required for alarms based on static thresholds. If you are
    #   creating an alarm based on a metric math expression, you specify the
    #   period for each metric within the objects in the `Metrics` array.
    #
    #   Be sure to specify 10 or 30 only for metrics that are stored by a
    #   `PutMetricData` call with a `StorageResolution` of 1. If you specify a
    #   period of 10 or 30 for a metric that does not have sub-minute
    #   resolution, the alarm still attempts to gather data at the period rate
    #   that you specify. In this case, it does not receive data for the
    #   attempts that do not correspond to a one-minute data resolution, and
    #   the alarm might often lapse into INSUFFICENT\_DATA status. Specifying
    #   10 or 30 also sets this alarm as a high-resolution alarm, which has a
    #   higher charge than other alarms. For more information about pricing,
    #   see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing][1].
    #
    #   An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no longer than one
    #   day, so `Period` multiplied by `EvaluationPeriods` cannot be more than
    #   86,400 seconds.

    # @option options [String] :unit
    #   The unit of measure for the statistic. For example, the units for the
    #   Amazon EC2 NetworkIn metric are Bytes because NetworkIn tracks the
    #   number of bytes that an instance receives on all network interfaces.
    #   You can also specify a unit when you create a custom metric. Units
    #   help provide conceptual meaning to your data. Metric data points that
    #   specify a unit of measure, such as Percent, are aggregated separately.
    #
    #   If you don't specify `Unit`, CloudWatch retrieves all unit types that
    #   have been published for the metric and attempts to evaluate the alarm.
    #   Usually, metrics are published with only one unit, so the alarm works
    #   as intended.
    #
    #   However, if the metric is published with multiple types of units and
    #   you don't specify a unit, the alarm's behavior is not defined and it
    #   behaves predictably.
    #
    #   We recommend omitting `Unit` so that you don't inadvertently specify
    #   an incorrect unit that is not published for this metric. Doing so
    #   causes the alarm to be stuck in the `INSUFFICIENT DATA` state.
    # @option options [required, Integer] :evaluation_periods
    #   The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified
    #   threshold. If you are setting an alarm that requires that a number of
    #   consecutive data points be breaching to trigger the alarm, this value
    #   specifies that number. If you are setting an "M out of N" alarm,
    #   this value is the N.
    #
    #   An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no longer than one
    #   day, so this number multiplied by `Period` cannot be more than 86,400
    #   seconds.
    # @option options [Integer] :datapoints_to_alarm
    #   The number of data points that must be breaching to trigger the alarm.
    #   This is used only if you are setting an "M out of N" alarm. In that
    #   case, this value is the M. For more information, see [Evaluating an
    #   Alarm][1] in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

    # @option options [Float] :threshold
    #   The value against which the specified statistic is compared.
    #
    #   This parameter is required for alarms based on static thresholds, but
    #   should not be used for alarms based on anomaly detection models.
    # @option options [required, String] :comparison_operator
    #   The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic
    #   and threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the first
    #   operand.
    #
    #   The values `LessThanLowerOrGreaterThanUpperThreshold`,
    #   `LessThanLowerThreshold`, and `GreaterThanUpperThreshold` are used
    #   only for alarms based on anomaly detection models.
    # @option options [String] :treat_missing_data
    #   Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. If
    #   `TreatMissingData` is omitted, the default behavior of `missing` is
    #   used. For more information, see [Configuring How CloudWatch Alarms
    #   Treats Missing Data][1].
    #
    #   Valid Values: `breaching | notBreaching | ignore | missing`

    # @option options [String] :evaluate_low_sample_count_percentile
    #   Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If you specify `ignore`,
    #   the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data
    #   points to be statistically significant. If you specify `evaluate` or
    #   omit this parameter, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly
    #   changes state no matter how many data points are available. For more
    #   information, see [Percentile-Based CloudWatch Alarms and Low Data
    #   Samples][1].

    # @option options [Array<Types::MetricDataQuery>] :metrics
    #   An array of `MetricDataQuery` structures that enable you to create an
    #   alarm based on the result of a metric math expression. For each
    #   `PutMetricAlarm` operation, you must specify either `MetricName` or a
    #   `Metrics` array.
    #
    #   Each item in the `Metrics` array either retrieves a metric or performs
    #   a math expression.
    #
    #   One item in the `Metrics` array is the expression that the alarm
    #   watches. You designate this expression by setting `ReturnValue` to
    #   true for this object in the array. For more information, see
    #   [MetricDataQuery][1].
    #
    #   If you use the `Metrics` parameter, you cannot include the
    #   `MetricName`, `Dimensions`, `Period`, `Namespace`, `Statistic`, or
    #   `ExtendedStatistic` parameters of `PutMetricAlarm` in the same
    #   operation. Instead, you retrieve the metrics you are using in your
    #   math expression as part of the `Metrics` array.

    # @option options [Array<Types::Tag>] :tags
    #   A list of key-value pairs to associate with the alarm. You can
    #   associate as many as 50 tags with an alarm.
    #
    #   Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also
    #   use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to
    #   access or change only resources with certain tag values.
    # @option options [String] :threshold_metric_id
    #   If this is an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, make this
    #   value match the ID of the `ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND` function.
    #
    #   For an example of how to use this parameter, see the **Anomaly
    #   Detection Model Alarm** example on this page.
    #
    #   If your alarm uses this parameter, it cannot have Auto Scaling
    #   actions.
