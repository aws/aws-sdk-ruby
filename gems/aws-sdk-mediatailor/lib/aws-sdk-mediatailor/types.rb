    # Access configuration parameters.
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] access_type
    #   The type of authentication used to access content from
    #   `HttpConfiguration::BaseUrl` on your source location.
    #
    #   `S3_SIGV4` - AWS Signature Version 4 authentication for Amazon S3
    #   hosted virtual-style access. If your source location base URL is an
    #   Amazon S3 bucket, MediaTailor can use AWS Signature Version 4
    #   (SigV4) authentication to access the bucket where your source
    #   content is stored. Your MediaTailor source location baseURL must
    #   follow the S3 virtual hosted-style request URL format. For example,
    #   https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name.
    #
    #   Before you can use `S3_SIGV4`, you must meet these requirements:
    #
    #   • You must allow MediaTailor to access your S3 bucket by granting
    #   mediatailor.amazonaws.com principal access in IAM. For information
    #   about configuring access in IAM, see Access management in the IAM
    #   User Guide.
    #
    #   • The mediatailor.amazonaws.com service principal must have
    #   permissions to read all top level manifests referenced by the
    #   VodSource packaging configurations.
    #
    #   • The caller of the API must have s3:GetObject IAM permissions to
    #   read all top level manifests referenced by your MediaTailor
    #   VodSource packaging configurations.
    #
    #   `AUTODETECT_SIGV4` - AWS Signature Version 4 authentication for a
    #   set of supported services: MediaPackage Version 2 and Amazon S3
    #   hosted virtual-style access. If your source location base URL is a
    #   MediaPackage Version 2 endpoint or an Amazon S3 bucket, MediaTailor
    #   can use AWS Signature Version 4 (SigV4) authentication to access the
    #   resource where your source content is stored.
    #
    #   Before you can use `AUTODETECT_SIGV4` with a MediaPackage Version 2
    #   endpoint, you must meet these requirements:
    #
    #   • You must grant MediaTailor access to your MediaPackage endpoint by
    #   granting `mediatailor.amazonaws.com` principal access in an Origin
    #   Access policy on the endpoint.
    #
    #   • Your MediaTailor source location base URL must be a MediaPackage
    #   V2 endpoint.
    #
    #   • The caller of the API must have `mediapackagev2:GetObject` IAM
    #   permissions to read all top level manifests referenced by the
    #   MediaTailor source packaging configurations.
    #
    #   Before you can use `AUTODETECT_SIGV4` with an Amazon S3 bucket, you
    #   must meet these requirements:
    #
    #   • You must grant MediaTailor access to your S3 bucket by granting
    #   `mediatailor.amazonaws.com` principal access in IAM. For more
    #   information about configuring access in IAM, see [Access
    #   management][1] in the *IAM User Guide.*.
    #
    #   • The `mediatailor.amazonaws.com` service principal must have
    #   permissions to read all top-level manifests referenced by the
    #   `VodSource` packaging configurations.
    #
    #   • The caller of the API must have `s3:GetObject` IAM permissions to
    #   read all top level manifests referenced by your MediaTailor
    #   `VodSource` packaging configurations.
