    #   <note markdown="1"> The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute*.
    #   The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's usage of an
    #   internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across
    #   partitions, based on their partition key values.
    #
    #    The sort key of an item is also known as its *range attribute*. The
    #   term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items
    #   with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted
    #   order by the sort key value.

    # @deprecated Use [Aws::DynamoDB::Client] #wait_until instead
    #
    # Waiter polls an API operation until a resource enters a desired
    # state.
    #
    # @note The waiting operation is performed on a copy. The original resource
    #   remains unchanged.
    #
    # ## Basic Usage
    #
    # Waiter will polls until it is successful, it fails by
    # entering a terminal state, or until a maximum number of attempts
    # are made.
    #
    #     # polls in a loop until condition is true
    #     resource.wait_until(options) {|resource| condition}
    #
    # ## Example
    #
    #     instance.wait_until(max_attempts:10, delay:5) do |instance|
    #       instance.state.name == 'running'
    #     end
    #
    # ## Configuration
    #
    # You can configure the maximum number of polling attempts, and the
    # delay (in seconds) between each polling attempt. The waiting condition is
    # set by passing a block to {#wait_until}:
    #
    #     # poll for ~25 seconds
    #     resource.wait_until(max_attempts:5,delay:5) {|resource|...}
    #
    # ## Callbacks
    #
    # You can be notified before each polling attempt and before each
    # delay. If you throw `:success` or `:failure` from these callbacks,
    # it will terminate the waiter.
    #
    #     started_at = Time.now
    #     # poll for 1 hour, instead of a number of attempts
    #     proc = Proc.new do |attempts, response|
    #       throw :failure if Time.now - started_at > 3600
    #     end
    #
    #       # disable max attempts
    #     instance.wait_until(before_wait:proc, max_attempts:nil) {...}
    #
    # ## Handling Errors
    #
    # When a waiter is successful, it returns the Resource. When a waiter
    # fails, it raises an error.

    #       resource.wait_until(...)

    # @option options [Hash<String,String>] :expression_attribute_names
    #   One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression.
    #   The following are some use cases for using
    #   `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved
    #     word.
    #
    #   * To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute
    #     name in an expression.
    #
    #   * To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being
    #     misinterpreted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute
    #   name. For example, consider the following attribute name:
    #
    #   * `Percentile`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
    #   cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of
    #   reserved words, see [Reserved Words][1] in the *Amazon DynamoDB
    #   Developer Guide*). To work around this, you could specify the
    #   following for `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * `\{"#P":"Percentile"\}`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this
    #   example:
    #
    #   * `#P = :val`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Tokens that begin with the **\:** character are *expression attribute
    #   values*, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.

    # @option options [Hash<String,Types::AttributeValue>] :expression_attribute_values
    #   One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **\:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an
    #   attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether
    #   the value of the *ProductStatus* attribute was one of the following:
    #
    #   `Available | Backordered | Discontinued`
    #
    #   You would first need to specify `ExpressionAttributeValues` as
    #   follows:
    #
    #   `\{ ":avail":\{"S":"Available"\}, ":back":\{"S":"Backordered"\},
    #   ":disc":\{"S":"Discontinued"\} \}`
    #
    #   You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:
    #
    #   `ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)`

    #   A map of attribute names to `AttributeValue` objects, representing the

    #
    #   For the primary key, you must provide all of the attributes. For

    #     for the operation, together with `ConsumedCapacity` for each table
    #     and secondary index that was accessed.
    #
    #     Note that some operations, such as `GetItem` and `BatchGetItem`, do
    #     not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying `INDEXES`
    #     will only return `ConsumedCapacity` information for table(s).
    #
    #   * `TOTAL` - The response includes only the aggregate
    #     `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation.
    #
    #   * `NONE` - No `ConsumedCapacity` details are included in the response.
    # @option options [String] :projection_expression
    #   A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the
    #   table. These attributes can include scalars, sets, or elements of a
    #   JSON document. The attributes in the expression must be separated by
    #   commas.
    #
    #   If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes are returned.
    #   If any of the requested attributes are not found, they do not appear

    #   the index.
    #
    #   * `ALL_ATTRIBUTES` - Returns all of the item attributes from the
    #     specified table or index. If you query a local secondary index, then
    #     for each matching item in the index, DynamoDB fetches the entire
    #     item from the parent table. If the index is configured to project
    #     all item attributes, then all of the data can be obtained from the
    #     local secondary index, and no fetching is required.

    #   * `ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES` - Allowed only when querying an index.
    #     Retrieves all attributes that have been projected into the index. If
    #     the index is configured to project all attributes, this return value
    #     is equivalent to specifying `ALL_ATTRIBUTES`.

    #   * `COUNT` - Returns the number of matching items, rather than the
    #     matching items themselves.
    #
    #   * `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES` - Returns only the attributes listed in
    #     `AttributesToGet`. This return value is equivalent to specifying
    #     `AttributesToGet` without specifying any value for `Select`.
    #
    #     If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only
    #     attributes that are projected into that index, the operation will

    # @option options [String] :key_condition_expression
    #   The condition that specifies the key values for items to be retrieved
    #   by the `Query` action.
    #
    #   The condition must perform an equality test on a single partition key
    #   value.
    #
    #   The condition can optionally perform one of several comparison tests
    #   on a single sort key value. This allows `Query` to retrieve one item
    #   with a given partition key value and sort key value, or several items
    #   that have the same partition key value but different sort key values.
    #
    #   The partition key equality test is required, and must be specified in
    #   the following format:
    #
    #   `partitionKeyName` *=* `:partitionkeyval`
    #
    #   If you also want to provide a condition for the sort key, it must be
    #   combined using `AND` with the condition for the sort key. Following is
    #   an example, using the **=** comparison operator for the sort key:
    #
    #   `partitionKeyName` `=` `:partitionkeyval` `AND` `sortKeyName` `=`
    #   `:sortkeyval`
    #
    #   Valid comparisons for the sort key condition are as follows:
    #
    #   * `sortKeyName` `=` `:sortkeyval` - true if the sort key value is
    #     equal to `:sortkeyval`.
    #
    #   * `sortKeyName` `<` `:sortkeyval` - true if the sort key value is less
    #     than `:sortkeyval`.
    #
    #   * `sortKeyName` `<=` `:sortkeyval` - true if the sort key value is
    #     less than or equal to `:sortkeyval`.
    #
    #   * `sortKeyName` `>` `:sortkeyval` - true if the sort key value is
    #     greater than `:sortkeyval`.
    #
    #   * `sortKeyName` `>= ` `:sortkeyval` - true if the sort key value is
    #     greater than or equal to `:sortkeyval`.
    #
    #   * `sortKeyName` `BETWEEN` `:sortkeyval1` `AND` `:sortkeyval2` - true
    #     if the sort key value is greater than or equal to `:sortkeyval1`,
    #     and less than or equal to `:sortkeyval2`.
    #
    #   * `begins_with (` `sortKeyName`, `:sortkeyval` `)` - true if the sort
    #     key value begins with a particular operand. (You cannot use this
    #     function with a sort key that is of type Number.) Note that the
    #     function name `begins_with` is case-sensitive.
    #
    #   Use the `ExpressionAttributeValues` parameter to replace tokens such
    #   as `:partitionval` and `:sortval` with actual values at runtime.
    #
    #   You can optionally use the `ExpressionAttributeNames` parameter to
    #   replace the names of the partition key and sort key with placeholder
    #   tokens. This option might be necessary if an attribute name conflicts
    #   with a DynamoDB reserved word. For example, the following
    #   `KeyConditionExpression` parameter causes an error because *Size* is a
    #   reserved word:
    #
    #   * `Size = :myval`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   To work around this, define a placeholder (such a `#S`) to represent
    #   the attribute name *Size*. `KeyConditionExpression` then is as
    #   follows:
    #
    #   * `#S = :myval`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   For a list of reserved words, see [Reserved Words][1] in the *Amazon
    #   DynamoDB Developer Guide*.
    #

    #   `ExpressionAttributeValues`, see [Using Placeholders for Attribute
    #   Names and Values][2] in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

    # @option options [Hash<String,String>] :expression_attribute_names
    #   One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression.
    #   The following are some use cases for using
    #   `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved
    #     word.
    #
    #   * To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute
    #     name in an expression.
    #
    #   * To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being
    #     misinterpreted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute
    #   name. For example, consider the following attribute name:
    #
    #   * `Percentile`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
    #   cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of
    #   reserved words, see [Reserved Words][1] in the *Amazon DynamoDB
    #   Developer Guide*). To work around this, you could specify the
    #   following for `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * `\{"#P":"Percentile"\}`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this
    #   example:
    #
    #   * `#P = :val`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Tokens that begin with the **\:** character are *expression attribute
    #   values*, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.

    # @option options [Hash<String,Types::AttributeValue>] :expression_attribute_values
    #   One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **\:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an
    #   attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether
    #   the value of the *ProductStatus* attribute was one of the following:
    #
    #   `Available | Backordered | Discontinued`
    #
    #   You would first need to specify `ExpressionAttributeValues` as
    #   follows:
    #
    #   `\{ ":avail":\{"S":"Available"\}, ":back":\{"S":"Backordered"\},
    #   ":disc":\{"S":"Discontinued"\} \}`
    #
    #   You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:
    #
    #   `ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)`
    #

    #   of 1, the `Scan` operation will be sequential rather than parallel.
    #
    #   If you specify `TotalSegments`, you must also specify `Segment`.
    # @option options [Integer] :segment
    #   For a parallel `Scan` request, `Segment` identifies an individual
    #   segment to be scanned by an application worker.
    #
    #   Segment IDs are zero-based, so the first segment is always 0. For
    #   example, if you want to use four application threads to scan a table
    #   or an index, then the first thread specifies a `Segment` value of 0,
    #   the second thread specifies 1, and so on.
    #
    #   The value of `LastEvaluatedKey` returned from a parallel `Scan`
    #   request must be used as `ExclusiveStartKey` with the same segment ID
    #   in a subsequent `Scan` operation.
    #
    #   The value for `Segment` must be greater than or equal to 0, and less
    #   than the value provided for `TotalSegments`.
    #
    #   If you provide `Segment`, you must also provide `TotalSegments`.
    # @option options [String] :projection_expression
    #   A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the
    #   specified table or index. These attributes can include scalars, sets,
    #   or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in the expression must
    #   be separated by commas.
    #
    #   If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes will be
    #   returned. If any of the requested attributes are not found, they will
    #   not appear in the result.

    # @option options [String] :filter_expression
    #   A string that contains conditions that DynamoDB applies after the
    #   `Scan` operation, but before the data is returned to you. Items that
    #   do not satisfy the `FilterExpression` criteria are not returned.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> A `FilterExpression` is applied after the items have already been
    #   read; the process of filtering does not consume any additional read
    #   capacity units.

    # @option options [Hash<String,String>] :expression_attribute_names
    #   One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression.
    #   The following are some use cases for using
    #   `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved
    #     word.
    #
    #   * To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute
    #     name in an expression.
    #
    #   * To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being
    #     misinterpreted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute
    #   name. For example, consider the following attribute name:
    #
    #   * `Percentile`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
    #   cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of
    #   reserved words, see [Reserved Words][1] in the *Amazon DynamoDB
    #   Developer Guide*). To work around this, you could specify the
    #   following for `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * `\{"#P":"Percentile"\}`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this
    #   example:
    #
    #   * `#P = :val`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Tokens that begin with the **\:** character are *expression attribute
    #   values*, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.

    # @option options [Hash<String,Types::AttributeValue>] :expression_attribute_values
    #   One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **\:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an
    #   attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether
    #   the value of the `ProductStatus` attribute was one of the following:
    #
    #   `Available | Backordered | Discontinued`
    #
    #   You would first need to specify `ExpressionAttributeValues` as
    #   follows:
    #
    #   `\{ ":avail":\{"S":"Available"\}, ":back":\{"S":"Backordered"\},
    #   ":disc":\{"S":"Discontinued"\} \}`
    #
    #   You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:
    #
    #   `ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)`
    #
    #   For more information on expression attribute values, see [Condition
    #   Expressions][1] in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

    # @option options [Boolean] :consistent_read
    #   A Boolean value that determines the read consistency model during the
    #   scan:
    #
    #   * If `ConsistentRead` is `false`, then the data returned from `Scan`
    #     might not contain the results from other recently completed write
    #     operations (`PutItem`, `UpdateItem`, or `DeleteItem`).
    #
    #   * If `ConsistentRead` is `true`, then all of the write operations that
    #     completed before the `Scan` began are guaranteed to be contained in
    #     the `Scan` response.
    #
    #   The default setting for `ConsistentRead` is `false`.
    #
    #   The `ConsistentRead` parameter is not supported on global secondary
    #   indexes. If you scan a global secondary index with `ConsistentRead`
    #   set to true, you will receive a `ValidationException`.

    #
    #   * `NONE` - If `ReturnValues` is not specified, or if its value is
    #     `NONE`, then nothing is returned. (This setting is the default for
    #     `ReturnValues`.)
    #
    #   * `ALL_OLD` - Returns all of the attributes of the item, as they
    #     appeared before the UpdateItem operation.
    #
    #   * `UPDATED_OLD` - Returns only the updated attributes, as they
    #     appeared before the UpdateItem operation.

    #     after the UpdateItem operation.
    #
    #   There is no additional cost associated with requesting a return value
    #   aside from the small network and processing overhead of receiving a

    #     for the operation, together with `ConsumedCapacity` for each table
    #     and secondary index that was accessed.
    #
    #     Note that some operations, such as `GetItem` and `BatchGetItem`, do
    #     not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying `INDEXES`
    #     will only return `ConsumedCapacity` information for table(s).
    #
    #   * `TOTAL` - The response includes only the aggregate
    #     `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation.
    #
    #   * `NONE` - No `ConsumedCapacity` details are included in the response.
    # @option options [String] :return_item_collection_metrics
    #   Determines whether item collection metrics are returned. If set to
    #   `SIZE`, the response includes statistics about item collections, if
    #   any, that were modified during the operation are returned in the
    #   response. If set to `NONE` (the default), no statistics are returned.
    # @option options [String] :update_expression
    #   An expression that defines one or more attributes to be updated, the
    #   action to be performed on them, and new values for them.
    #
    #   The following action values are available for `UpdateExpression`.
    #
    #   * `SET` - Adds one or more attributes and values to an item. If any of
    #     these attributes already exist, they are replaced by the new values.
    #     You can also use `SET` to add or subtract from an attribute that is
    #     of type Number. For example: `SET myNum = myNum + :val`
    #
    #     `SET` supports the following functions:
    #
    #     * `if_not_exists (path, operand)` - if the item does not contain an
    #       attribute at the specified path, then `if_not_exists` evaluates to
    #       operand; otherwise, it evaluates to path. You can use this
    #       function to avoid overwriting an attribute that may already be
    #       present in the item.
    #
    #     * `list_append (operand, operand)` - evaluates to a list with a new
    #       element added to it. You can append the new element to the start
    #       or the end of the list by reversing the order of the operands.
    #
    #     These function names are case-sensitive.
    #
    #   * `REMOVE` - Removes one or more attributes from an item.
    #
    #   * `ADD` - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does
    #     not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of
    #     `ADD` depends on the data type of the attribute:
    #
    #     * If the existing attribute is a number, and if `Value` is also a
    #       number, then `Value` is mathematically added to the existing
    #       attribute. If `Value` is a negative number, then it is subtracted
    #       from the existing attribute.
    #
    #       <note markdown="1"> If you use `ADD` to increment or decrement a number value for an
    #       item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses `0` as
    #       the initial value.
    #
    #        Similarly, if you use `ADD` for an existing item to increment or
    #       decrement an attribute value that doesn't exist before the
    #       update, DynamoDB uses `0` as the initial value. For example,
    #       suppose that the item you want to update doesn't have an
    #       attribute named `itemcount`, but you decide to `ADD` the number
    #       `3` to this attribute anyway. DynamoDB will create the `itemcount`
    #       attribute, set its initial value to `0`, and finally add `3` to
    #       it. The result will be a new `itemcount` attribute in the item,
    #       with a value of `3`.
    #
    #        </note>
    #
    #     * If the existing data type is a set and if `Value` is also a set,
    #       then `Value` is added to the existing set. For example, if the
    #       attribute value is the set `[1,2]`, and the `ADD` action specified
    #       `[3]`, then the final attribute value is `[1,2,3]`. An error
    #       occurs if an `ADD` action is specified for a set attribute and the
    #       attribute type specified does not match the existing set type.
    #
    #       Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if
    #       the existing data type is a set of strings, the `Value` must also
    #       be a set of strings.
    #
    #     The `ADD` action only supports Number and set data types. In
    #     addition, `ADD` can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested
    #     attributes.
    #
    #   * `DELETE` - Deletes an element from a set.
    #
    #     If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted
    #     from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set
    #     `[a,b,c]` and the `DELETE` action specifies `[a,c]`, then the final
    #     attribute value is `[b]`. Specifying an empty set is an error.
    #
    #     The `DELETE` action only supports set data types. In addition,
    #     `DELETE` can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested
    #     attributes.
    #
    #   You can have many actions in a single expression, such as the
    #   following: `SET a=:value1, b=:value2 DELETE :value3, :value4, :value5`

    # @option options [String] :condition_expression
    #   A condition that must be satisfied in order for a conditional update
    #   to succeed.
    #
    #   An expression can contain any of the following:
    #
    #   * Functions: `attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists | attribute_type
    #     | contains | begins_with | size`
    #
    #     These function names are case-sensitive.
    #
    #   * Comparison operators: `= | <> | < | > | <= | >= | BETWEEN | IN `
    #
    #   * Logical operators: `AND | OR | NOT`

    # @option options [Hash<String,String>] :expression_attribute_names
    #   One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression.
    #   The following are some use cases for using
    #   `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved
    #     word.
    #
    #   * To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute
    #     name in an expression.
    #
    #   * To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being
    #     misinterpreted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute
    #   name. For example, consider the following attribute name:
    #
    #   * `Percentile`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
    #   cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of
    #   reserved words, see [Reserved Words][1] in the *Amazon DynamoDB
    #   Developer Guide*.) To work around this, you could specify the
    #   following for `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * `\{"#P":"Percentile"\}`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this
    #   example:
    #
    #   * `#P = :val`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Tokens that begin with the **\:** character are *expression attribute
    #   values*, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.

    # @option options [Hash<String,Types::AttributeValue>] :expression_attribute_values
    #   One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **\:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an
    #   attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether
    #   the value of the `ProductStatus` attribute was one of the following:
    #
    #   `Available | Backordered | Discontinued`
    #
    #   You would first need to specify `ExpressionAttributeValues` as
    #   follows:
    #
    #   `\{ ":avail":\{"S":"Available"\}, ":back":\{"S":"Backordered"\},
    #   ":disc":\{"S":"Discontinued"\} \}`
    #
    #   You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:
    #
    #   `ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)`
    #

    #   Expressions][1] in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.
