    #   @return [Types::AttributeValue]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] action
    #   Specifies how to perform the update. Valid values are `PUT`
    #   (default), `DELETE`, and `ADD`. The behavior depends on whether the
    #   specified primary key already exists in the table.
    #
    #   **If an item with the specified *Key* is found in the table:**
    #
    #   * `PUT` - Adds the specified attribute to the item. If the attribute
    #     already exists, it is replaced by the new value.
    #
    #   * `DELETE` - If no value is specified, the attribute and its value
    #     are removed from the item. The data type of the specified value
    #     must match the existing value's data type.
    #
    #     If a *set* of values is specified, then those values are
    #     subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value
    #     was the set `[a,b,c]` and the `DELETE` action specified `[a,c]`,
    #     then the final attribute value would be `[b]`. Specifying an empty
    #     set is an error.
    #
    #   * `ADD` - If the attribute does not already exist, then the
    #     attribute and its values are added to the item. If the attribute
    #     does exist, then the behavior of `ADD` depends on the data type of
    #     the attribute:
    #
    #     * If the existing attribute is a number, and if `Value` is also a
    #       number, then the `Value` is mathematically added to the existing
    #       attribute. If `Value` is a negative number, then it is
    #       subtracted from the existing attribute.
    #
    #       <note markdown="1"> If you use `ADD` to increment or decrement a number value for an
    #       item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses 0 as
    #       the initial value.
    #
    #        In addition, if you use `ADD` to update an existing item, and
    #       intend to increment or decrement an attribute value which does
    #       not yet exist, DynamoDB uses `0` as the initial value. For
    #       example, suppose that the item you want to update does not yet
    #       have an attribute named *itemcount*, but you decide to `ADD` the
    #       number `3` to this attribute anyway, even though it currently
    #       does not exist. DynamoDB will create the *itemcount* attribute,
    #       set its initial value to `0`, and finally add `3` to it. The
    #       result will be a new *itemcount* attribute in the item, with a
    #       value of `3`.
    #
    #        </note>
    #
    #     * If the existing data type is a set, and if the `Value` is also a
    #       set, then the `Value` is added to the existing set. (This is a
    #       *set* operation, not mathematical addition.) For example, if the
    #       attribute value was the set `[1,2]`, and the `ADD` action
    #       specified `[3]`, then the final attribute value would be
    #       `[1,2,3]`. An error occurs if an Add action is specified for a
    #       set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match
    #       the existing set type.
    #
    #       Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example,
    #       if the existing data type is a set of strings, the `Value` must
    #       also be a set of strings. The same holds true for number sets
    #       and binary sets.
    #
    #     This action is only valid for an existing attribute whose data
    #     type is number or is a set. Do not use `ADD` for any other data
    #     types.
    #
    #   **If no item with the specified *Key* is found:**
    #
    #   * `PUT` - DynamoDB creates a new item with the specified primary
    #     key, and then adds the attribute.
    #
    #   * `DELETE` - Nothing happens; there is no attribute to delete.
    #
    #   * `ADD` - DynamoDB creates an item with the supplied primary key and
    #     number (or set of numbers) for the attribute value. The only data
    #     types allowed are number and number set; no other data types can
    #     be specified.

    #   describes one or more items to retrieve from that table. Each table
    #   name can be used only once per `BatchGetItem` request.
    #
    #   Each element in the map of items to retrieve consists of the
    #   following:
    #
    #   * `ConsistentRead` - If `true`, a strongly consistent read is used;
    #     if `false` (the default), an eventually consistent read is used.
    #
    #   * `ExpressionAttributeNames` - One or more substitution tokens for
    #     attribute names in the `ProjectionExpression` parameter. The
    #     following are some use cases for using
    #     `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #     * To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB
    #       reserved word.
    #
    #     * To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an
    #       attribute name in an expression.
    #
    #     * To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being
    #       misinterpreted in an expression.
    #
    #     Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an
    #     attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute
    #     name:
    #
    #     * `Percentile`
    #
    #     ^
    #
    #     The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
    #     cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list
    #     of reserved words, see [Reserved Words][1] in the *Amazon DynamoDB
    #     Developer Guide*). To work around this, you could specify the
    #     following for `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #     * `\{"#P":"Percentile"\}`
    #
    #     ^
    #
    #     You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this
    #     example:
    #
    #     * `#P = :val`
    #
    #     ^
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Tokens that begin with the **\:** character are *expression
    #     attribute values*, which are placeholders for the actual value at
    #     runtime.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #     For more information about expression attribute names, see
    #     [Accessing Item Attributes][2] in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer
    #     Guide*.
    #
    #   * `Keys` - An array of primary key attribute values that define
    #     specific items in the table. For each primary key, you must
    #     provide *all* of the key attributes. For example, with a simple
    #     primary key, you only need to provide the partition key value. For
    #     a composite key, you must provide *both* the partition key value
    #     and the sort key value.
    #
    #   * `ProjectionExpression` - A string that identifies one or more
    #     attributes to retrieve from the table. These attributes can
    #     include scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document. The
    #     attributes in the expression must be separated by commas.
    #
    #     If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes are
    #     returned. If any of the requested attributes are not found, they
    #     do not appear in the result.
    #
    #     For more information, see [Accessing Item Attributes][2] in the
    #     *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   * `AttributesToGet` - This is a legacy parameter. Use
    #     `ProjectionExpression` instead. For more information, see

    #
    #   The following comparison operators are available:

    #   NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN`
    #
    #   The following are descriptions of each comparison operator.
    #
    #   * `EQ`\: Equal. `EQ` is supported for all data types, including
    #     lists and maps.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element
    #     of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary
    #     Set. If an item contains an `AttributeValue` element of a
    #     different type than the one provided in the request, the value
    #     does not match. For example, `\{"S":"6"\}` does not equal
    #     `\{"N":"6"\}`. Also, `\{"N":"6"\}` does not equal `\{"NS":["6",
    #     "2", "1"]\}`.
    #
    #
    #
    #   * `NE`\: Not equal. `NE` is supported for all data types, including
    #     lists and maps.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` of type
    #     String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If
    #     an item contains an `AttributeValue` of a different type than the
    #     one provided in the request, the value does not match. For
    #     example, `\{"S":"6"\}` does not equal `\{"N":"6"\}`. Also,
    #     `\{"N":"6"\}` does not equal `\{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]\}`.
    #
    #
    #
    #   * `LE`\: Less than or equal.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element
    #     of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item
    #     contains an `AttributeValue` element of a different type than the
    #     one provided in the request, the value does not match. For
    #     example, `\{"S":"6"\}` does not equal `\{"N":"6"\}`. Also,
    #     `\{"N":"6"\}` does not compare to `\{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]\}`.
    #
    #
    #
    #   * `LT`\: Less than.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` of type
    #     String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an
    #     `AttributeValue` element of a different type than the one provided
    #     in the request, the value does not match. For example,
    #     `\{"S":"6"\}` does not equal `\{"N":"6"\}`. Also, `\{"N":"6"\}`
    #     does not compare to `\{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]\}`.
    #
    #
    #
    #   * `GE`\: Greater than or equal.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element
    #     of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item
    #     contains an `AttributeValue` element of a different type than the
    #     one provided in the request, the value does not match. For
    #     example, `\{"S":"6"\}` does not equal `\{"N":"6"\}`. Also,
    #     `\{"N":"6"\}` does not compare to `\{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]\}`.
    #
    #
    #
    #   * `GT`\: Greater than.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element
    #     of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item
    #     contains an `AttributeValue` element of a different type than the
    #     one provided in the request, the value does not match. For
    #     example, `\{"S":"6"\}` does not equal `\{"N":"6"\}`. Also,
    #     `\{"N":"6"\}` does not compare to `\{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]\}`.
    #
    #
    #
    #   * `NOT_NULL`\: The attribute exists. `NOT_NULL` is supported for all
    #     data types, including lists and maps.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> This operator tests for the existence of an attribute, not its
    #     data type. If the data type of attribute "`a`" is null, and you
    #     evaluate it using `NOT_NULL`, the result is a Boolean `true`. This
    #     result is because the attribute "`a`" exists; its data type is
    #     not relevant to the `NOT_NULL` comparison operator.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   * `NULL`\: The attribute does not exist. `NULL` is supported for all
    #     data types, including lists and maps.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute, not its
    #     data type. If the data type of attribute "`a`" is null, and you
    #     evaluate it using `NULL`, the result is a Boolean `false`. This is
    #     because the attribute "`a`" exists; its data type is not
    #     relevant to the `NULL` comparison operator.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   * `CONTAINS`\: Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element
    #     of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target
    #     attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator
    #     checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the
    #     comparison is of type Binary, then the operator looks for a
    #     subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target
    #     attribute of the comparison is a set ("`SS`", "`NS`", or
    #     "`BS`"), then the operator evaluates to true if it finds an
    #     exact match with any member of the set.
    #
    #     CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating "`a CONTAINS
    #     b`", "`a`" can be a list; however, "`b`" cannot be a set, a
    #     map, or a list.
    #
    #   * `NOT_CONTAINS`\: Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence
    #     of a value in a set.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element
    #     of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target
    #     attribute of the comparison is a String, then the operator checks
    #     for the absence of a substring match. If the target attribute of
    #     the comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for the absence
    #     of a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the
    #     target attribute of the comparison is a set ("`SS`", "`NS`",
    #     or "`BS`"), then the operator evaluates to true if it *does not*
    #     find an exact match with any member of the set.
    #
    #     NOT\_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating "`a NOT
    #     CONTAINS b`", "`a`" can be a list; however, "`b`" cannot be a
    #     set, a map, or a list.
    #
    #   * `BEGINS_WITH`\: Checks for a prefix.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` of type
    #     String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target
    #     attribute of the comparison must be of type String or Binary (not
    #     a Number or a set type).
    #
    #
    #
    #   * `IN`\: Checks for matching elements in a list.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain one or more `AttributeValue`
    #     elements of type String, Number, or Binary. These attributes are
    #     compared against an existing attribute of an item. If any elements
    #     of the input are equal to the item attribute, the expression
    #     evaluates to true.
    #
    #   * `BETWEEN`\: Greater than or equal to the first value, and less
    #     than or equal to the second value.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` must contain two `AttributeValue` elements of
    #     the same type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type).
    #     A target attribute matches if the target value is greater than, or
    #     equal to, the first element and less than, or equal to, the second
    #     element. If an item contains an `AttributeValue` element of a
    #     different type than the one provided in the request, the value
    #     does not match. For example, `\{"S":"6"\}` does not compare to
    #     `\{"N":"6"\}`. Also, `\{"N":"6"\}` does not compare to
    #     `\{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]\}`

    #   Model][1] in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   Each `KeySchemaElement` in the array is composed of:
    #
    #   * `AttributeName` - The name of this key attribute.
    #
    #   * `KeyType` - The role that the key attribute will assume:
    #
    #     * `HASH` - partition key
    #
    #     * `RANGE` - sort key
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute*.
    #   The term "hash attribute" derives from the DynamoDB usage of an
    #   internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across
    #   partitions, based on their partition key values.
    #
    #    The sort key of an item is also known as its *range attribute*. The
    #   term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items
    #   with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted
    #   order by the sort key value.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   For a simple primary key (partition key), you must provide exactly
    #   one element with a `KeyType` of `HASH`.
    #
    #   For a composite primary key (partition key and sort key), you must
    #   provide exactly two elements, in this order: The first element must
    #   have a `KeyType` of `HASH`, and the second element must have a
    #   `KeyType` of `RANGE`.

    # @!attribute [rw] condition_expression
    #   A condition that must be satisfied in order for a conditional

    #
    #   * Functions: `attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists |

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] expression_attribute_names
    #   One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an
    #   expression. The following are some use cases for using
    #   `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB
    #     reserved word.
    #
    #   * To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute
    #     name in an expression.
    #
    #   * To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being
    #     misinterpreted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute
    #   name. For example, consider the following attribute name:
    #
    #   * `Percentile`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
    #   cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of
    #   reserved words, see [Reserved Words][1] in the *Amazon DynamoDB
    #   Developer Guide*). To work around this, you could specify the
    #   following for `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * `\{"#P":"Percentile"\}`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this
    #   example:
    #
    #   * `#P = :val`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Tokens that begin with the **\:** character are *expression
    #   attribute values*, which are placeholders for the actual value at
    #   runtime.
    #
    #    </note>

    #   @return [Hash<String,String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] expression_attribute_values
    #   One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **\:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an
    #   attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check
    #   whether the value of the *ProductStatus* attribute was one of the
    #   following:
    #
    #   `Available | Backordered | Discontinued`
    #
    #   You would first need to specify `ExpressionAttributeValues` as
    #   follows:
    #
    #   `\{ ":avail":\{"S":"Available"\}, ":back":\{"S":"Backordered"\},
    #   ":disc":\{"S":"Discontinued"\} \}`
    #
    #   You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:
    #
    #   `ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)`
    #

    #     gigabytes. This value is a two-element array containing a lower
    #     bound and an upper bound for the estimate. The estimate includes
    #     the size of all the items in the table, plus the size of all

    # Represents a condition to be compared with an attribute value. This
    # condition can be used with `DeleteItem`, `PutItem` or `UpdateItem`
    # operations; if the comparison evaluates to true, the operation
    # succeeds; if not, the operation fails. You can use
    # `ExpectedAttributeValue` in one of two different ways:
    #
    # * Use `AttributeValueList` to specify one or more values to compare
    #   against an attribute. Use `ComparisonOperator` to specify how you
    #   want to perform the comparison. If the comparison evaluates to true,
    #   then the conditional operation succeeds.
    #
    # * Use `Value` to specify a value that DynamoDB will compare against an
    #   attribute. If the values match, then `ExpectedAttributeValue`
    #   evaluates to true and the conditional operation succeeds.
    #   Optionally, you can also set `Exists` to false, indicating that you
    #   *do not* expect to find the attribute value in the table. In this
    #   case, the conditional operation succeeds only if the comparison
    #   evaluates to false.
    #
    # `Value` and `Exists` are incompatible with `AttributeValueList` and
    # `ComparisonOperator`. Note that if you use both sets of parameters at
    # once, DynamoDB will return a `ValidationException` exception.
    #
    # @note When making an API call, you may pass ExpectedAttributeValue
    #   data as a hash:
    #
    #       {
    #         value: "value", # value <Hash,Array,String,Numeric,Boolean,IO,Set,nil>
    #         exists: false,

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] value
    #   Represents the data for the expected attribute.

    #   @return [Types::AttributeValue]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] exists
    #   Causes DynamoDB to evaluate the value before attempting a
    #   conditional operation:
    #
    #   * If `Exists` is `true`, DynamoDB will check to see if that
    #     attribute value already exists in the table. If it is found, then
    #     the operation succeeds. If it is not found, the operation fails
    #     with a `ConditionCheckFailedException`.
    #
    #   * If `Exists` is `false`, DynamoDB assumes that the attribute value
    #     does not exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist,
    #     then the assumption is valid and the operation succeeds. If the
    #     value is found, despite the assumption that it does not exist, the
    #     operation fails with a `ConditionCheckFailedException`.
    #
    #   The default setting for `Exists` is `true`. If you supply a `Value`
    #   all by itself, DynamoDB assumes the attribute exists: You don't
    #   have to set `Exists` to `true`, because it is implied.
    #
    #   DynamoDB returns a `ValidationException` if:
    #
    #   * `Exists` is `true` but there is no `Value` to check. (You expect a
    #     value to exist, but don't specify what that value is.)
    #
    #   * `Exists` is `false` but you also provide a `Value`. (You cannot
    #     expect an attribute to have a value, while also expecting it not
    #     to exist.)
    #   @return [Boolean]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] comparison_operator
    #   A comparator for evaluating attributes in the `AttributeValueList`.
    #   For example, equals, greater than, less than, etc.
    #
    #   The following comparison operators are available:
    #
    #   `EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS |
    #   NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN`
    #
    #   The following are descriptions of each comparison operator.
    #
    #   * `EQ`\: Equal. `EQ` is supported for all data types, including
    #     lists and maps.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element
    #     of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary
    #     Set. If an item contains an `AttributeValue` element of a
    #     different type than the one provided in the request, the value
    #     does not match. For example, `\{"S":"6"\}` does not equal
    #     `\{"N":"6"\}`. Also, `\{"N":"6"\}` does not equal `\{"NS":["6",
    #     "2", "1"]\}`.
    #
    #
    #
    #   * `NE`\: Not equal. `NE` is supported for all data types, including
    #     lists and maps.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` of type
    #     String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If
    #     an item contains an `AttributeValue` of a different type than the
    #     one provided in the request, the value does not match. For
    #     example, `\{"S":"6"\}` does not equal `\{"N":"6"\}`. Also,
    #     `\{"N":"6"\}` does not equal `\{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]\}`.
    #
    #
    #
    #   * `LE`\: Less than or equal.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element
    #     of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item
    #     contains an `AttributeValue` element of a different type than the
    #     one provided in the request, the value does not match. For
    #     example, `\{"S":"6"\}` does not equal `\{"N":"6"\}`. Also,
    #     `\{"N":"6"\}` does not compare to `\{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]\}`.
    #
    #
    #
    #   * `LT`\: Less than.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` of type
    #     String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an
    #     `AttributeValue` element of a different type than the one provided
    #     in the request, the value does not match. For example,
    #     `\{"S":"6"\}` does not equal `\{"N":"6"\}`. Also, `\{"N":"6"\}`
    #     does not compare to `\{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]\}`.
    #
    #
    #
    #   * `GE`\: Greater than or equal.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element
    #     of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item
    #     contains an `AttributeValue` element of a different type than the
    #     one provided in the request, the value does not match. For
    #     example, `\{"S":"6"\}` does not equal `\{"N":"6"\}`. Also,
    #     `\{"N":"6"\}` does not compare to `\{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]\}`.
    #
    #
    #
    #   * `GT`\: Greater than.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element
    #     of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item
    #     contains an `AttributeValue` element of a different type than the
    #     one provided in the request, the value does not match. For
    #     example, `\{"S":"6"\}` does not equal `\{"N":"6"\}`. Also,
    #     `\{"N":"6"\}` does not compare to `\{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]\}`.
    #
    #
    #
    #   * `NOT_NULL`\: The attribute exists. `NOT_NULL` is supported for all
    #     data types, including lists and maps.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> This operator tests for the existence of an attribute, not its
    #     data type. If the data type of attribute "`a`" is null, and you
    #     evaluate it using `NOT_NULL`, the result is a Boolean `true`. This
    #     result is because the attribute "`a`" exists; its data type is
    #     not relevant to the `NOT_NULL` comparison operator.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   * `NULL`\: The attribute does not exist. `NULL` is supported for all
    #     data types, including lists and maps.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute, not its
    #     data type. If the data type of attribute "`a`" is null, and you
    #     evaluate it using `NULL`, the result is a Boolean `false`. This is
    #     because the attribute "`a`" exists; its data type is not
    #     relevant to the `NULL` comparison operator.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   * `CONTAINS`\: Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element
    #     of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target
    #     attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator
    #     checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the
    #     comparison is of type Binary, then the operator looks for a
    #     subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target
    #     attribute of the comparison is a set ("`SS`", "`NS`", or
    #     "`BS`"), then the operator evaluates to true if it finds an
    #     exact match with any member of the set.
    #
    #     CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating "`a CONTAINS
    #     b`", "`a`" can be a list; however, "`b`" cannot be a set, a
    #     map, or a list.
    #
    #   * `NOT_CONTAINS`\: Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence
    #     of a value in a set.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` element
    #     of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target
    #     attribute of the comparison is a String, then the operator checks
    #     for the absence of a substring match. If the target attribute of
    #     the comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for the absence
    #     of a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the
    #     target attribute of the comparison is a set ("`SS`", "`NS`",
    #     or "`BS`"), then the operator evaluates to true if it *does not*
    #     find an exact match with any member of the set.
    #
    #     NOT\_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating "`a NOT
    #     CONTAINS b`", "`a`" can be a list; however, "`b`" cannot be a
    #     set, a map, or a list.
    #
    #   * `BEGINS_WITH`\: Checks for a prefix.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain only one `AttributeValue` of type
    #     String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target
    #     attribute of the comparison must be of type String or Binary (not
    #     a Number or a set type).
    #
    #
    #
    #   * `IN`\: Checks for matching elements in a list.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` can contain one or more `AttributeValue`
    #     elements of type String, Number, or Binary. These attributes are
    #     compared against an existing attribute of an item. If any elements
    #     of the input are equal to the item attribute, the expression
    #     evaluates to true.
    #
    #   * `BETWEEN`\: Greater than or equal to the first value, and less
    #     than or equal to the second value.
    #
    #     `AttributeValueList` must contain two `AttributeValue` elements of
    #     the same type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type).
    #     A target attribute matches if the target value is greater than, or
    #     equal to, the first element and less than, or equal to, the second
    #     element. If an item contains an `AttributeValue` element of a
    #     different type than the one provided in the request, the value
    #     does not match. For example, `\{"S":"6"\}` does not compare to
    #     `\{"N":"6"\}`. Also, `\{"N":"6"\}` does not compare to
    #     `\{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]\}`
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] attribute_value_list
    #   One or more values to evaluate against the supplied attribute. The
    #   number of values in the list depends on the `ComparisonOperator`
    #   being used.
    #
    #   For type Number, value comparisons are numeric.
    #
    #   String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or less than are
    #   based on ASCII character code values. For example, `a` is greater
    #   than `A`, and `a` is greater than `B`. For a list of code values,
    #   see
    #   [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII\_printable\_characters][1].
    #
    #   For Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned
    #   when it compares binary values.

    # @!attribute [rw] expression_attribute_names
    #   One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an
    #   expression. The following are some use cases for using
    #   `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB
    #     reserved word.
    #
    #   * To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute
    #     name in an expression.
    #
    #   * To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being
    #     misinterpreted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute
    #   name. For example, consider the following attribute name:
    #
    #   * `Percentile`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
    #   cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of
    #   reserved words, see [Reserved Words][1] in the *Amazon DynamoDB
    #   Developer Guide*). To work around this, you could specify the
    #   following for `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * `\{"#P":"Percentile"\}`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this
    #   example:
    #
    #   * `#P = :val`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Tokens that begin with the **\:** character are *expression
    #   attribute values*, which are placeholders for the actual value at
    #   runtime.

    # @!attribute [rw] expression_attribute_names
    #   One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an
    #   expression. The following are some use cases for using
    #   `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB
    #     reserved word.
    #
    #   * To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute
    #     name in an expression.
    #
    #   * To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being
    #     misinterpreted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute
    #   name. For example, consider the following attribute name:
    #
    #   * `Percentile`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
    #   cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of
    #   reserved words, see [Reserved Words][1] in the *Amazon DynamoDB
    #   Developer Guide*). To work around this, you could specify the
    #   following for `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * `\{"#P":"Percentile"\}`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this
    #   example:
    #
    #   * `#P = :val`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Tokens that begin with the **\:** character are *expression
    #   attribute values*, which are placeholders for the actual value at
    #   runtime.
    #

    #   A map of attribute name/value pairs, one for each attribute. Only

    #   other attribute name-value pairs for the item.
    #
    #   You must provide all of the attributes for the primary key. For
    #   example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide a value
    #   for the partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide
    #   both values for both the partition key and the sort key.
    #
    #   If you specify any attributes that are part of an index key, then

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] expression_attribute_names
    #   One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an
    #   expression. The following are some use cases for using
    #   `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB
    #     reserved word.
    #
    #   * To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute
    #     name in an expression.
    #
    #   * To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being
    #     misinterpreted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute
    #   name. For example, consider the following attribute name:
    #
    #   * `Percentile`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
    #   cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of
    #   reserved words, see [Reserved Words][1] in the *Amazon DynamoDB
    #   Developer Guide*). To work around this, you could specify the
    #   following for `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * `\{"#P":"Percentile"\}`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this
    #   example:
    #
    #   * `#P = :val`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Tokens that begin with the **\:** character are *expression
    #   attribute values*, which are placeholders for the actual value at
    #   runtime.
    #

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] expression_attribute_values
    #   One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **\:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an
    #   attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check
    #   whether the value of the *ProductStatus* attribute was one of the
    #   following:
    #
    #   `Available | Backordered | Discontinued`
    #
    #   You would first need to specify `ExpressionAttributeValues` as
    #   follows:
    #
    #   `\{ ":avail":\{"S":"Available"\}, ":back":\{"S":"Backordered"\},
    #   ":disc":\{"S":"Discontinued"\} \}`
    #
    #   You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:

    #   `ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)`

    #   projected into the index.
    #
    #   * `ALL_ATTRIBUTES` - Returns all of the item attributes from the
    #     specified table or index. If you query a local secondary index,
    #     then for each matching item in the index, DynamoDB fetches the
    #     entire item from the parent table. If the index is configured to
    #     project all item attributes, then all of the data can be obtained
    #     from the local secondary index, and no fetching is required.
    #
    #   * `ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES` - Allowed only when querying an index.
    #     Retrieves all attributes that have been projected into the index.
    #     If the index is configured to project all attributes, this return
    #     value is equivalent to specifying `ALL_ATTRIBUTES`.

    #     matching items themselves.
    #
    #   * `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES` - Returns only the attributes listed in
    #     `AttributesToGet`. This return value is equivalent to specifying

    #
    #     If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only
    #     attributes that are projected into that index, the operation will
    #     read only the index and not the table. If any of the requested
    #     attributes are not projected into the local secondary index,
    #     DynamoDB fetches each of these attributes from the parent table.
    #     This extra fetching incurs additional throughput cost and latency.
    #
    #     If you query or scan a global secondary index, you can only
    #     request attributes that are projected into the index. Global
    #     secondary index queries cannot fetch attributes from the parent
    #     table.
    #
    #   If neither `Select` nor `AttributesToGet` are specified, DynamoDB

    #   `ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES` when accessing an index. You cannot use
    #   both `Select` and `AttributesToGet` together in a single request,
    #   unless the value for `Select` is `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES`. (This usage
    #   is equivalent to specifying `AttributesToGet` without any value for

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] key_condition_expression
    #   The condition that specifies the key values for items to be
    #   retrieved by the `Query` action.
    #
    #   The condition must perform an equality test on a single partition
    #   key value.
    #
    #   The condition can optionally perform one of several comparison tests
    #   on a single sort key value. This allows `Query` to retrieve one item
    #   with a given partition key value and sort key value, or several
    #   items that have the same partition key value but different sort key
    #   values.
    #
    #   The partition key equality test is required, and must be specified
    #   in the following format:
    #
    #   `partitionKeyName` *=* `:partitionkeyval`
    #
    #   If you also want to provide a condition for the sort key, it must be
    #   combined using `AND` with the condition for the sort key. Following
    #   is an example, using the **=** comparison operator for the sort key:
    #
    #   `partitionKeyName` `=` `:partitionkeyval` `AND` `sortKeyName` `=`
    #   `:sortkeyval`
    #
    #   Valid comparisons for the sort key condition are as follows:
    #
    #   * `sortKeyName` `=` `:sortkeyval` - true if the sort key value is
    #     equal to `:sortkeyval`.
    #
    #   * `sortKeyName` `<` `:sortkeyval` - true if the sort key value is
    #     less than `:sortkeyval`.
    #
    #   * `sortKeyName` `<=` `:sortkeyval` - true if the sort key value is
    #     less than or equal to `:sortkeyval`.
    #
    #   * `sortKeyName` `>` `:sortkeyval` - true if the sort key value is
    #     greater than `:sortkeyval`.
    #
    #   * `sortKeyName` `>= ` `:sortkeyval` - true if the sort key value is
    #     greater than or equal to `:sortkeyval`.
    #
    #   * `sortKeyName` `BETWEEN` `:sortkeyval1` `AND` `:sortkeyval2` - true
    #     if the sort key value is greater than or equal to `:sortkeyval1`,
    #     and less than or equal to `:sortkeyval2`.
    #
    #   * `begins_with (` `sortKeyName`, `:sortkeyval` `)` - true if the
    #     sort key value begins with a particular operand. (You cannot use
    #     this function with a sort key that is of type Number.) Note that
    #     the function name `begins_with` is case-sensitive.
    #
    #   Use the `ExpressionAttributeValues` parameter to replace tokens such
    #   as `:partitionval` and `:sortval` with actual values at runtime.
    #
    #   You can optionally use the `ExpressionAttributeNames` parameter to
    #   replace the names of the partition key and sort key with placeholder
    #   tokens. This option might be necessary if an attribute name
    #   conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word. For example, the following
    #   `KeyConditionExpression` parameter causes an error because *Size* is
    #   a reserved word:
    #
    #   * `Size = :myval`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   To work around this, define a placeholder (such a `#S`) to represent
    #   the attribute name *Size*. `KeyConditionExpression` then is as
    #   follows:
    #
    #   * `#S = :myval`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   For a list of reserved words, see [Reserved Words][1] in the *Amazon
    #   DynamoDB Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   For more information on `ExpressionAttributeNames` and
    #   `ExpressionAttributeValues`, see [Using Placeholders for Attribute
    #   Names and Values][2] in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] expression_attribute_names
    #   One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an
    #   expression. The following are some use cases for using
    #   `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB
    #     reserved word.
    #
    #   * To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute
    #     name in an expression.
    #
    #   * To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being
    #     misinterpreted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute
    #   name. For example, consider the following attribute name:
    #
    #   * `Percentile`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
    #   cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of
    #   reserved words, see [Reserved Words][1] in the *Amazon DynamoDB
    #   Developer Guide*). To work around this, you could specify the
    #   following for `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * `\{"#P":"Percentile"\}`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this
    #   example:
    #
    #   * `#P = :val`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Tokens that begin with the **\:** character are *expression
    #   attribute values*, which are placeholders for the actual value at
    #   runtime.

    # @!attribute [rw] expression_attribute_values
    #   One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **\:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an
    #   attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check
    #   whether the value of the *ProductStatus* attribute was one of the
    #   following:
    #
    #   `Available | Backordered | Discontinued`
    #
    #   You would first need to specify `ExpressionAttributeValues` as
    #   follows:
    #
    #   `\{ ":avail":\{"S":"Available"\}, ":back":\{"S":"Backordered"\},
    #   ":disc":\{"S":"Discontinued"\} \}`
    #

    #   projected into the index.
    #
    #   * `ALL_ATTRIBUTES` - Returns all of the item attributes from the
    #     specified table or index. If you query a local secondary index,
    #     then for each matching item in the index, DynamoDB fetches the
    #     entire item from the parent table. If the index is configured to
    #     project all item attributes, then all of the data can be obtained
    #     from the local secondary index, and no fetching is required.
    #
    #   * `ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES` - Allowed only when querying an index.
    #     Retrieves all attributes that have been projected into the index.
    #     If the index is configured to project all attributes, this return
    #     value is equivalent to specifying `ALL_ATTRIBUTES`.
    #
    #   * `COUNT` - Returns the number of matching items, rather than the
    #     matching items themselves.
    #
    #   * `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES` - Returns only the attributes listed in
    #     `AttributesToGet`. This return value is equivalent to specifying
    #     `AttributesToGet` without specifying any value for `Select`.
    #
    #     If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only
    #     attributes that are projected into that index, the operation reads
    #     only the index and not the table. If any of the requested
    #     attributes are not projected into the local secondary index,
    #     DynamoDB fetches each of these attributes from the parent table.
    #     This extra fetching incurs additional throughput cost and latency.
    #
    #     If you query or scan a global secondary index, you can only
    #     request attributes that are projected into the index. Global
    #     secondary index queries cannot fetch attributes from the parent
    #     table.
    #
    #   If neither `Select` nor `AttributesToGet` are specified, DynamoDB
    #   defaults to `ALL_ATTRIBUTES` when accessing a table, and

    #   the second thread specifies 1, and so on.
    #
    #   The value of `LastEvaluatedKey` returned from a parallel `Scan`
    #   request must be used as `ExclusiveStartKey` with the same segment ID
    #   in a subsequent `Scan` operation.
    #
    #   The value for `Segment` must be greater than or equal to 0, and less

    # @!attribute [rw] expression_attribute_names
    #   One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an

    #   `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB
    #     reserved word.
    #
    #   * To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute
    #     name in an expression.
    #
    #   * To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being
    #     misinterpreted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute
    #   name. For example, consider the following attribute name:
    #
    #   * `Percentile`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
    #   cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of
    #   reserved words, see [Reserved Words][1] in the *Amazon DynamoDB
    #   Developer Guide*). To work around this, you could specify the
    #   following for `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * `\{"#P":"Percentile"\}`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this
    #   example:
    #
    #   * `#P = :val`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Tokens that begin with the **\:** character are *expression
    #   attribute values*, which are placeholders for the actual value at
    #   runtime.

    # @!attribute [rw] expression_attribute_values
    #   One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **\:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an
    #   attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check
    #   whether the value of the `ProductStatus` attribute was one of the
    #   following:
    #
    #   `Available | Backordered | Discontinued`
    #
    #   You would first need to specify `ExpressionAttributeValues` as
    #   follows:
    #
    #   `\{ ":avail":\{"S":"Available"\}, ":back":\{"S":"Backordered"\},
    #   ":disc":\{"S":"Discontinued"\} \}`
    #

    #   more local secondary indexes are subject to an item collection size
    #   limit, where the amount of data within a given item collection
    #   cannot exceed 10 GB. Each element is composed of:
    #
    #   * `IndexName` - The name of the local secondary index.
    #
    #   * `KeySchema` - Specifies the complete index key schema. The
    #     attribute names in the key schema must be between 1 and 255
    #     characters (inclusive). The key schema must begin with the same
    #     partition key as the table.
    #
    #   * `Projection` - Specifies attributes that are copied (projected)
    #     from the table into the index. These are in addition to the
    #     primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are
    #     automatically projected. Each attribute specification is composed
    #     of:
    #
    #     * `ProjectionType` - One of the following:
    #
    #       * `KEYS_ONLY` - Only the index and primary keys are projected
    #         into the index.

    #       across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 20. If you
    #       project the same attribute into two different indexes, this
    #       counts as two distinct attributes when determining the total.
    #
    #   * `IndexSizeBytes` - Represents the total size of the index, in
    #     bytes. DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours.
    #     Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.
    #
    #   * `ItemCount` - Represents the number of items in the index.

    #   The global secondary indexes, if any, on the table. Each index is
    #   scoped to a given partition key value. Each element is composed of:
    #
    #   * `Backfilling` - If true, then the index is currently in the
    #     backfilling phase. Backfilling occurs only when a new global
    #     secondary index is added to the table; it is the process by which
    #     DynamoDB populates the new index with data from the table. (This
    #     attribute does not appear for indexes that were created during a
    #     `CreateTable` operation.)
    #
    #   * `IndexName` - The name of the global secondary index.
    #
    #   * `IndexSizeBytes` - The total size of the global secondary index,
    #     in bytes. DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six
    #     hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.
    #
    #   * `IndexStatus` - The current status of the global secondary index:
    #
    #     * `CREATING` - The index is being created.
    #
    #     * `UPDATING` - The index is being updated.
    #
    #     * `DELETING` - The index is being deleted.
    #
    #     * `ACTIVE` - The index is ready for use.
    #
    #   * `ItemCount` - The number of items in the global secondary index.
    #     DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours. Recent
    #     changes might not be reflected in this value.
    #
    #   * `KeySchema` - Specifies the complete index key schema. The
    #     attribute names in the key schema must be between 1 and 255
    #     characters (inclusive). The key schema must begin with the same
    #     partition key as the table.

    #   object. These can operate on items in different tables, but the

    #     for the operation, together with `ConsumedCapacity` for each table
    #     and secondary index that was accessed.
    #
    #     Note that some operations, such as `GetItem` and `BatchGetItem`,
    #     do not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying
    #     `INDEXES` will only return `ConsumedCapacity` information for
    #     table(s).
    #
    #   * `TOTAL` - The response includes only the aggregate
    #     `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation.

    #     response.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] return_item_collection_metrics
    #   Determines whether item collection metrics are returned. If set to
    #   `SIZE`, the response includes statistics about item collections (if
    #   any), that were modified during the operation and are returned in
    #   the response. If set to `NONE` (the default), no statistics are
    #   returned.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] client_request_token
    #   Providing a `ClientRequestToken` makes the call to
    #   `TransactWriteItems` idempotent, meaning that multiple identical
    #   calls have the same effect as one single call.
    #
    #   Although multiple identical calls using the same client request
    #   token produce the same result on the server (no side effects), the
    #   responses to the calls might not be the same. If the
    #   `ReturnConsumedCapacity>` parameter is set, then the initial
    #   `TransactWriteItems` call returns the amount of write capacity units
    #   consumed in making the changes. Subsequent `TransactWriteItems`
    #   calls with the same client token return the number of read capacity
    #   units consumed in reading the item.
    #
    #   A client request token is valid for 10 minutes after the first
    #   request that uses it is completed. After 10 minutes, any request
    #   with the same client token is treated as a new request. Do not
    #   resubmit the same request with the same client token for more than
    #   10 minutes, or the result might not be idempotent.
    #
    #   If you submit a request with the same client token but a change in
    #   other parameters within the 10-minute idempotency window, DynamoDB
    #   returns an `IdempotentParameterMismatch` exception.
    #
    #   **A suitable default value is auto-generated.** You should normally
    #   not need to pass this option.

    #   * `ALL_OLD` - Returns all of the attributes of the item, as they
    #     appeared before the UpdateItem operation.

    #   * `UPDATED_OLD` - Returns only the updated attributes, as they
    #     appeared before the UpdateItem operation.

    # @!attribute [rw] update_expression
    #   An expression that defines one or more attributes to be updated, the
    #   action to be performed on them, and new values for them.
    #
    #   The following action values are available for `UpdateExpression`.
    #
    #   * `SET` - Adds one or more attributes and values to an item. If any
    #     of these attributes already exist, they are replaced by the new
    #     values. You can also use `SET` to add or subtract from an
    #     attribute that is of type Number. For example: `SET myNum = myNum
    #     + :val`
    #
    #     `SET` supports the following functions:
    #
    #     * `if_not_exists (path, operand)` - if the item does not contain
    #       an attribute at the specified path, then `if_not_exists`
    #       evaluates to operand; otherwise, it evaluates to path. You can
    #       use this function to avoid overwriting an attribute that may
    #       already be present in the item.
    #
    #     * `list_append (operand, operand)` - evaluates to a list with a
    #       new element added to it. You can append the new element to the
    #       start or the end of the list by reversing the order of the
    #       operands.
    #
    #     These function names are case-sensitive.
    #
    #   * `REMOVE` - Removes one or more attributes from an item.
    #
    #   * `ADD` - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute
    #     does not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the
    #     behavior of `ADD` depends on the data type of the attribute:
    #
    #     * If the existing attribute is a number, and if `Value` is also a
    #       number, then `Value` is mathematically added to the existing
    #       attribute. If `Value` is a negative number, then it is
    #       subtracted from the existing attribute.
    #
    #       <note markdown="1"> If you use `ADD` to increment or decrement a number value for an
    #       item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses `0` as
    #       the initial value.
    #
    #        Similarly, if you use `ADD` for an existing item to increment or
    #       decrement an attribute value that doesn't exist before the
    #       update, DynamoDB uses `0` as the initial value. For example,
    #       suppose that the item you want to update doesn't have an
    #       attribute named `itemcount`, but you decide to `ADD` the number
    #       `3` to this attribute anyway. DynamoDB will create the
    #       `itemcount` attribute, set its initial value to `0`, and finally
    #       add `3` to it. The result will be a new `itemcount` attribute in
    #       the item, with a value of `3`.
    #
    #        </note>
    #
    #     * If the existing data type is a set and if `Value` is also a set,
    #       then `Value` is added to the existing set. For example, if the
    #       attribute value is the set `[1,2]`, and the `ADD` action
    #       specified `[3]`, then the final attribute value is `[1,2,3]`. An
    #       error occurs if an `ADD` action is specified for a set attribute
    #       and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set
    #       type.
    #
    #       Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example,
    #       if the existing data type is a set of strings, the `Value` must
    #       also be a set of strings.
    #
    #     The `ADD` action only supports Number and set data types. In
    #     addition, `ADD` can only be used on top-level attributes, not
    #     nested attributes.
    #
    #   * `DELETE` - Deletes an element from a set.
    #
    #     If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted
    #     from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set
    #     `[a,b,c]` and the `DELETE` action specifies `[a,c]`, then the
    #     final attribute value is `[b]`. Specifying an empty set is an
    #     error.
    #
    #     The `DELETE` action only supports set data types. In addition,
    #     `DELETE` can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested
    #     attributes.
    #
    #   You can have many actions in a single expression, such as the
    #   following: `SET a=:value1, b=:value2 DELETE :value3, :value4,
    #   :value5`

    #   * Functions: `attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists |
    #     attribute_type | contains | begins_with | size`

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] expression_attribute_names
    #   One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an
    #   expression. The following are some use cases for using
    #   `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB
    #     reserved word.
    #
    #   * To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute
    #     name in an expression.
    #
    #   * To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being
    #     misinterpreted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute
    #   name. For example, consider the following attribute name:
    #
    #   * `Percentile`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
    #   cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of
    #   reserved words, see [Reserved Words][1] in the *Amazon DynamoDB
    #   Developer Guide*.) To work around this, you could specify the
    #   following for `ExpressionAttributeNames`\:
    #
    #   * `\{"#P":"Percentile"\}`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this
    #   example:
    #
    #   * `#P = :val`
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Tokens that begin with the **\:** character are *expression
    #   attribute values*, which are placeholders for the actual value at
    #   runtime.

    # @!attribute [rw] expression_attribute_values
    #   One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.
    #
    #   Use the **\:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an
    #   attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check
    #   whether the value of the `ProductStatus` attribute was one of the
    #   following:
    #
    #   `Available | Backordered | Discontinued`
    #
    #   You would first need to specify `ExpressionAttributeValues` as
    #   follows:
    #
    #   `\{ ":avail":\{"S":"Available"\}, ":back":\{"S":"Backordered"\},
    #   ":disc":\{"S":"Discontinued"\} \}`
    #
    #   You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:
    #
    #   `ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)`
