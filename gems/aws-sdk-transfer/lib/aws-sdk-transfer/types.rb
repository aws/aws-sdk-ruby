    #   A `HomeDirectory` example is `/bucket_name/home/mydirectory`.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] home_directory_type
    #   The type of landing directory (folder) you want your users' home
    #   directory to be when they log into the server. If you set it to
    #   `PATH`, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths
    #   as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it
    #   `LOGICAL`, you need to provide mappings in the
    #   `HomeDirectoryMappings` for how you want to make Amazon S3 or EFS
    #   paths visible to your users.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] home_directory_mappings
    #   Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS
    #   paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to
    #   make them visible. You must specify the `Entry` and `Target` pair,
    #   where `Entry` shows how the path is made visible and `Target` is the
    #   actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target,
    #   it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Amazon Web
    #   Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access
    #   to paths in `Target`. This value can only be set when
    #   `HomeDirectoryType` is set to *LOGICAL*.
    #
    #   The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example.
    #
    #   `[ \{ "Entry": "/directory1", "Target":
    #   "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" \} ]`
    #
    #   In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy
    #   to lock down your user to the designated home directory
    #   ("`chroot`"). To do this, you can set `Entry` to `/` and set
    #   `Target` to the `HomeDirectory` parameter value.
    #
    #   The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example for `chroot`.
    #
    #   `[ \{ "Entry:": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" \} ]`
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon
    #   S3 or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you can use the
    #   Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects as place holders
    #   for your directory. If using the CLI, use the `s3api` or `efsapi`
    #   call instead of `s3` or `efs` so you can use the put-object
    #   operation. For example, you use the following: `aws s3api put-object
    #   --bucket bucketname --key path/to/folder/`. Make sure that the end
    #   of the key name ends in a `/` for it to be considered a folder.
    #
    #    </note>
    #   @return [Array<Types::HomeDirectoryMapEntry>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] policy
    #   A session policy for your user so that you can use the same IAM role
    #   across multiple users. This policy scopes down user access to
    #   portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use
    #   inside this policy include `$\{Transfer:UserName\}`,
    #   `$\{Transfer:HomeDirectory\}`, and `$\{Transfer:HomeBucket\}`.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> This only applies when the domain of `ServerId` is S3. EFS does not
    #   use session policies.
    #
    #    For session policies, Amazon Web Services Transfer Family stores the
    #   policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
    #   the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the
    #   `Policy` argument.

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] home_directory_type
    #   The type of landing directory (folder) you want your users' home
    #   directory to be when they log into the server. If you set it to
    #   `PATH`, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths
    #   as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it
    #   `LOGICAL`, you need to provide mappings in the
    #   `HomeDirectoryMappings` for how you want to make Amazon S3 or EFS
    #   paths visible to your users.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] home_directory_mappings
    #   Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS
    #   paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to
    #   make them visible. You must specify the `Entry` and `Target` pair,
    #   where `Entry` shows how the path is made visible and `Target` is the
    #   actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target,
    #   it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Amazon Web
    #   Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access
    #   to paths in `Target`. This value can only be set when
    #   `HomeDirectoryType` is set to *LOGICAL*.
    #
    #   The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example.
    #
    #   `[ \{ "Entry": "/directory1", "Target":
    #   "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" \} ]`
    #
    #   In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy
    #   to lock your user down to the designated home directory
    #   ("`chroot`"). To do this, you can set `Entry` to `/` and set
    #   `Target` to the HomeDirectory parameter value.
    #
    #   The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example for `chroot`.
    #
    #   `[ \{ "Entry:": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" \} ]`
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon
    #   S3 or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you can use the
    #   Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects as place holders
    #   for your directory. If using the CLI, use the `s3api` or `efsapi`
    #   call instead of `s3` or `efs` so you can use the put-object
    #   operation. For example, you use the following: `aws s3api put-object
    #   --bucket bucketname --key path/to/folder/`. Make sure that the end
    #   of the key name ends in a `/` for it to be considered a folder.

    # @!attribute [rw] policy
    #   A session policy for your user so that you can use the same IAM role
    #   across multiple users. This policy scopes down user access to
    #   portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use
    #   inside this policy include `$\{Transfer:UserName\}`,
    #   `$\{Transfer:HomeDirectory\}`, and `$\{Transfer:HomeBucket\}`.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> This only applies when the domain of `ServerId` is S3. EFS does not
    #   use session policies.
    #
    #    For session policies, Amazon Web Services Transfer Family stores the
    #   policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
    #   the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the

    # @!attribute [rw] tls_session_resumption_mode
    #   A property used with Transfer servers that use the FTPS protocol.
    #   TLS Session Resumption provides a mechanism to resume or share a
    #   negotiated secret key between the control and data connection for an
    #   FTPS session. `TlsSessionResumptionMode` determines whether or not
    #   the server resumes recent, negotiated sessions through a unique
    #   session ID. This property is available during `CreateServer` and
    #   `UpdateServer` calls. If a `TlsSessionResumptionMode` value is not
    #   specified during CreateServer, it is set to `ENFORCED` by default.
    #
    #   * `DISABLED`\: the server does not process TLS session resumption
    #     client requests and creates a new TLS session for each request.
    #
    #   * `ENABLED`\: the server processes and accepts clients that are
    #     performing TLS session resumption. The server doesn't reject
    #     client data connections that do not perform the TLS session
    #     resumption client processing.
    #
    #   * `ENFORCED`\: the server processes and accepts clients that are
    #     performing TLS session resumption. The server rejects client data
    #     connections that do not perform the TLS session resumption client
    #     processing. Before you set the value to `ENFORCED`, test your
    #     clients.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Not all FTPS clients perform TLS session resumption. So, if you
    #     choose to enforce TLS session resumption, you prevent any
    #     connections from FTPS clients that don't perform the protocol
    #     negotiation. To determine whether or not you can use the
    #     `ENFORCED` value, you need to test your clients.

    #   Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access

    #
    #   In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy

    #   <note markdown="1"> If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon
    #   S3 or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you can use the

    #   for your directory. If using the CLI, use the `s3api` or `efsapi`
    #   call instead of `s3` or `efs` so you can use the put-object
    #   operation. For example, you use the following: `aws s3api put-object
    #   --bucket bucketname --key path/to/folder/`. Make sure that the end

    #   or host it inside your VPC. With an endpoint that is hosted in a
    #   VPC, you can restrict access to your server and resources only
    #   within your VPC or choose to make it internet facing by attaching
    #   Elastic IP addresses directly to it.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using
    #   `EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT` in your Amazon Web Servicesaccount if

    #    It is recommended that you use `VPC` as the `EndpointType`. With
    #   this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to
    #   three Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server's

    #   paths visible to your users.
    #   @return [String]
    #

    #   Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS
    #   paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to
    #   make them visible. You must specify the `Entry` and `Target` pair,
    #   where `Entry` shows how the path is made visible and `Target` is the
    #   actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target,
    #   it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Amazon Web
    #   Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access
    #   to paths in `Target`. This value can only be set when
    #   `HomeDirectoryType` is set to *LOGICAL*.
    #
    #   The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example.
    #
    #   `[ \{ "Entry": "/directory1", "Target":
    #   "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" \} ]`
    #
    #   In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy
    #   to lock down your user to the designated home directory
    #   ("`chroot`"). To do this, you can set `Entry` to '/' and set
    #   `Target` to the HomeDirectory parameter value.

    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon
    #   S3 or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you can use the
    #   Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects as place holders
    #   for your directory. If using the CLI, use the `s3api` or `efsapi`
    #   call instead of `s3` or `efs` so you can use the put-object
    #   operation. For example, you use the following: `aws s3api put-object
    #   --bucket bucketname --key path/to/folder/`. Make sure that the end
    #   of the key name ends in a `/` for it to be considered a folder.
