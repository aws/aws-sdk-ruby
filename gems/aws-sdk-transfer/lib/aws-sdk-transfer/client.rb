    # @overload initialize(options)
    #   @param [Hash] options
    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading static credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleWebIdentityCredentials` - Used when you need to
    #       assume a role after providing credentials via the web.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SSOCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from AWS SSO using an
    #       access token generated from `aws login`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ProcessCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       process that outputs to stdout.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ECSCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from
    #       instances running in ECS.
    #
    #     * `Aws::CognitoIdentityCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from the Cognito Identity service.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2/ECS IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts
    #       are very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #       `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` or `Aws::ECSCredentials` to
    #       enable retries and extended timeouts. Instance profile credential
    #       fetching can be disabled by setting ENV['AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED']
    #       to true.
    #
    #   @option options [required, String] :region
    #     The AWS region to connect to.  The configured `:region` is

    #     a default `:region` is searched for in the following locations:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:region]`
    #     * `ENV['AWS_REGION']`
    #     * `ENV['AMAZON_REGION']`
    #     * `ENV['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION']`
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`

    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :adaptive_retry_wait_to_fill (true)
    #     Used only in `adaptive` retry mode.  When true, the request will sleep
    #     until there is sufficent client side capacity to retry the request.
    #     When false, the request will raise a `RetryCapacityNotAvailableError` and will
    #     not retry instead of sleeping.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :client_side_monitoring (false)
    #     When `true`, client-side metrics will be collected for all API requests from

    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :convert_params (true)
    #     When `true`, an attempt is made to coerce request parameters into
    #     the required types.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :correct_clock_skew (true)
    #     Used only in `standard` and adaptive retry modes. Specifies whether to apply
    #     a clock skew correction and retry requests with skewed client clocks.

    #     Set to true to disable SDK automatically adding host prefix
    #     to default service endpoint when available.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :endpoint
    #     The client endpoint is normally constructed from the `:region`
    #     option. You should only configure an `:endpoint` when connecting
    #     to test or custom endpoints. This should be a valid HTTP(S) URI.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :endpoint_cache_max_entries (1000)
    #     Used for the maximum size limit of the LRU cache storing endpoints data
    #     for endpoint discovery enabled operations. Defaults to 1000.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :endpoint_cache_max_threads (10)

    #     is not set, logging will be disabled.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :max_attempts (3)
    #     An integer representing the maximum number attempts that will be made for
    #     a single request, including the initial attempt.  For example,
    #     setting this value to 5 will result in a request being retried up to
    #     4 times. Used in `standard` and `adaptive` retry modes.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :profile ("default")
    #     Used when loading credentials from the shared credentials file
    #     at HOME/.aws/credentials.  When not specified, 'default' is used.
    #
    #   @option options [Proc] :retry_backoff
    #     A proc or lambda used for backoff. Defaults to 2**retries * retry_base_delay.
    #     This option is only used in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :retry_base_delay (0.3)
    #     The base delay in seconds used by the default backoff function. This option
    #     is only used in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [Symbol] :retry_jitter (:none)
    #     A delay randomiser function used by the default backoff function.
    #     Some predefined functions can be referenced by name - :none, :equal, :full,
    #     otherwise a Proc that takes and returns a number. This option is only used
    #     in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #     @see https://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2015/03/backoff.html
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_limit (3)
    #     The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #     ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #     are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #     checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors, auth errors,
    #     endpoint discovery, and errors from expired credentials.
    #     This option is only used in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_max_delay (0)
    #     The maximum number of seconds to delay between retries (0 for no limit)
    #     used by the default backoff function. This option is only used in the
    #     `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :retry_mode ("legacy")
    #     Specifies which retry algorithm to use. Values are:
    #
    #     * `legacy` - The pre-existing retry behavior.  This is default value if
    #       no retry mode is provided.
    #
    #     * `standard` - A standardized set of retry rules across the AWS SDKs.
    #       This includes support for retry quotas, which limit the number of
    #       unsuccessful retries a client can make.
    #
    #     * `adaptive` - An experimental retry mode that includes all the
    #       functionality of `standard` mode along with automatic client side
    #       throttling.  This is a provisional mode that may change behavior
    #       in the future.
    #
    #
    #   @option options [String] :secret_access_key
    #
    #   @option options [String] :session_token
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :simple_json (false)
    #     Disables request parameter conversion, validation, and formatting.
    #     Also disable response data type conversions. This option is useful
    #     when you want to ensure the highest level of performance by
    #     avoiding overhead of walking request parameters and response data
    #     structures.
    #
    #     When `:simple_json` is enabled, the request parameters hash must
    #     be formatted exactly as the DynamoDB API expects.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #     Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #     fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #     the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #     {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #     ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #     requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :use_dualstack_endpoint
    #     When set to `true`, dualstack enabled endpoints (with `.aws` TLD)
    #     will be used if available.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :use_fips_endpoint
    #     When set to `true`, fips compatible endpoints will be used if available.
    #     When a `fips` region is used, the region is normalized and this config
    #     is set to `true`.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #     When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #     sending the request.
    #
    #   @option options [URI::HTTP,String] :http_proxy A proxy to send
    #     requests through.  Formatted like 'http://proxy.com:123'.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_open_timeout (15) The number of
    #     seconds to wait when opening a HTTP session before raising a
    #     `Timeout::Error`.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_read_timeout (60) The default
    #     number of seconds to wait for response data.  This value can
    #     safely be set per-request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_idle_timeout (5) The number of
    #     seconds a connection is allowed to sit idle before it is
    #     considered stale.  Stale connections are closed and removed
    #     from the pool before making a request.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_continue_timeout (1) The number of
    #     seconds to wait for a 100-continue response before sending the
    #     request body.  This option has no effect unless the request has
    #     "Expect" header set to "100-continue".  Defaults to `nil` which
    #     disables this behaviour.  This value can safely be set per
    #     request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :ssl_timeout (nil) Sets the SSL timeout
    #     in seconds.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :http_wire_trace (false) When `true`,
    #     HTTP debug output will be sent to the `:logger`.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :ssl_verify_peer (true) When `true`,
    #     SSL peer certificates are verified when establishing a
    #     connection.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_bundle Full path to the SSL
    #     certificate authority bundle file that should be used when
    #     verifying peer certificates.  If you do not pass
    #     `:ssl_ca_bundle` or `:ssl_ca_directory` the the system default
    #     will be used if available.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_directory Full path of the
    #     directory that contains the unbundled SSL certificate
    #     authority files for verifying peer certificates.  If you do
    #     not pass `:ssl_ca_bundle` or `:ssl_ca_directory` the the
    #     system default will be used if available.

    # @!group API Operations

    # Used by administrators to choose which groups in the directory should
    # have access to upload and download files over the enabled protocols
    # using Amazon Web Services Transfer Family. For example, a Microsoft
    # Active Directory might contain 50,000 users, but only a small fraction
    # might need the ability to transfer files to the server. An
    # administrator can use `CreateAccess` to limit the access to the
    # correct set of users who need this ability.
    #
    # @option params [String] :home_directory
    #   The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the
    #   server using the client.
    #
    #   A `HomeDirectory` example is `/bucket_name/home/mydirectory`.
    #
    # @option params [String] :home_directory_type
    #   The type of landing directory (folder) you want your users' home
    #   directory to be when they log into the server. If you set it to
    #   `PATH`, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths
    #   as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it
    #   `LOGICAL`, you need to provide mappings in the `HomeDirectoryMappings`
    #   for how you want to make Amazon S3 or EFS paths visible to your users.
    #
    # @option params [Array<Types::HomeDirectoryMapEntry>] :home_directory_mappings
    #   Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS
    #   paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make
    #   them visible. You must specify the `Entry` and `Target` pair, where
    #   `Entry` shows how the path is made visible and `Target` is the actual
    #   Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is
    #   displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Amazon Web Services
    #   Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in
    #   `Target`. This value can only be set when `HomeDirectoryType` is set
    #   to *LOGICAL*.
    #
    #   The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example.
    #
    #   `[ \{ "Entry": "/directory1", "Target":
    #   "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" \} ]`
    #
    #   In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to
    #   lock down your user to the designated home directory ("`chroot`").
    #   To do this, you can set `Entry` to `/` and set `Target` to the
    #   `HomeDirectory` parameter value.
    #
    #   The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example for `chroot`.
    #
    #   `[ \{ "Entry:": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" \} ]`
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3
    #   or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon
    #   S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your
    #   directory. If using the CLI, use the `s3api` or `efsapi` call instead
    #   of `s3` or `efs` so you can use the put-object operation. For example,
    #   you use the following: `aws s3api put-object --bucket bucketname --key
    #   path/to/folder/`. Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a `/`
    #   for it to be considered a folder.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    # @option params [String] :policy
    #   A session policy for your user so that you can use the same IAM role
    #   across multiple users. This policy scopes down user access to portions
    #   of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this
    #   policy include `$\{Transfer:UserName\}`,
    #   `$\{Transfer:HomeDirectory\}`, and `$\{Transfer:HomeBucket\}`.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> This only applies when the domain of `ServerId` is S3. EFS does not
    #   use session policies.
    #
    #    For session policies, Amazon Web Services Transfer Family stores the
    #   policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
    #   the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the
    #   `Policy` argument.
    #
    #    For an example of a session policy, see [Example session policy][1].

    # @option params [Types::PosixProfile] :posix_profile
    #   The full POSIX identity, including user ID (`Uid`), group ID (`Gid`),
    #   and any secondary groups IDs (`SecondaryGids`), that controls your
    #   users' access to your Amazon EFS file systems. The POSIX permissions
    #   that are set on files and directories in your file system determine
    #   the level of access your users get when transferring files into and
    #   out of your Amazon EFS file systems.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :role
    #   Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that controls
    #   your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS file system. The
    #   policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you
    #   want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of
    #   your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS file system. The IAM role should also
    #   contain a trust relationship that allows the server to access your
    #   resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :server_id
    #   A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance. This is the

    # @option params [String] :domain
    #   The domain of the storage system that is used for file transfers.
    #   There are two domains available: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
    #   S3) and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). The default value is
    #   S3.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> After the server is created, the domain cannot be changed.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    # @option params [Types::EndpointDetails] :endpoint_details
    #   The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are configured
    #   for your server. When you host your endpoint within your VPC, you can
    #   make it accessible only to resources within your VPC, or you can
    #   attach Elastic IP addresses and make it accessible to clients over the
    #   internet. Your VPC's default security groups are automatically
    #   assigned to your endpoint.
    #
    # @option params [String] :endpoint_type
    #   The type of endpoint that you want your server to use. You can choose
    #   to make your server's endpoint publicly accessible (PUBLIC) or host
    #   it inside your VPC. With an endpoint that is hosted in a VPC, you can
    #   restrict access to your server and resources only within your VPC or
    #   choose to make it internet facing by attaching Elastic IP addresses
    #   directly to it.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using
    #   `EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT` in your Amazon Web Services account if
    #   your account hasn't already done so before May 19, 2021. If you have
    #   already created servers with `EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT` in your
    #   Amazon Web Services account on or before May 19, 2021, you will not be
    #   affected. After this date, use `EndpointType`=`VPC`.
    #
    #    For more information, see
    #   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.
    #
    #    It is recommended that you use `VPC` as the `EndpointType`. With this
    #   endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three
    #   Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server's endpoint
    #   and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client's
    #   public IP address. This is not possible with `EndpointType` set to
    #   `VPC_ENDPOINT`.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    # @option params [String] :host_key
    #   The RSA private key as generated by the `ssh-keygen -N "" -m PEM -f
    #   my-new-server-key` command.
    #
    #   If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing
    #   SFTP-enabled server to a new server, don't update the host key.
    #   Accidentally changing a server's host key can be disruptive.
    #
    #   For more information, see [Change the host key for your SFTP-enabled
    #   server][1] in the *Amazon Web Services Transfer Family User Guide*.

    #
    # @option params [Types::IdentityProviderDetails] :identity_provider_details
    #   Required when `IdentityProviderType` is set to `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE`
    #   or `API_GATEWAY`. Accepts an array containing all of the information
    #   required to use a directory in `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE` or invoke a
    #   customer-supplied authentication API, including the API Gateway URL.
    #   Not required when `IdentityProviderType` is set to `SERVICE_MANAGED`.
    #
    # @option params [String] :identity_provider_type
    #   Specifies the mode of authentication for a server. The default value
    #   is `SERVICE_MANAGED`, which allows you to store and access user
    #   credentials within the Amazon Web Services Transfer Family service.
    #
    #   Use `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE` to provide access to Active Directory
    #   groups in Amazon Web Services Managed Active Directory or Microsoft
    #   Active Directory in your on-premises environment or in Amazon Web
    #   Services using AD Connectors. This option also requires you to provide
    #   a Directory ID using the `IdentityProviderDetails` parameter.
    #
    #   Use the `API_GATEWAY` value to integrate with an identity provider of
    #   your choosing. The `API_GATEWAY` setting requires you to provide an
    #   API Gateway endpoint URL to call for authentication using the
    #   `IdentityProviderDetails` parameter.
    #
    #   Use the `AWS_LAMBDA` value to directly use a Lambda function as your
    #   identity provider. If you choose this value, you must specify the ARN
    #   for the lambda function in the `Function` parameter for the
    #   `IdentityProviderDetails` data type.
    #
    # @option params [String] :logging_role
    #   Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services
    #   Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows a server to turn
    #   on Amazon CloudWatch logging for Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS events. When
    #   set, user activity can be viewed in your CloudWatch logs.
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :protocols
    #   Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file
    #   transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint. The
    #   available protocols are:
    #
    #   * `SFTP` (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File transfer
    #     over SSH
    #
    #   * `FTPS` (File Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS
    #     encryption
    #
    #   * `FTP` (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you select `FTPS`, you must choose a certificate stored in Amazon
    #   Web Services Certificate Manager (ACM) which is used to identify your
    #   server when clients connect to it over FTPS.
    #
    #    If `Protocol` includes either `FTP` or `FTPS`, then the `EndpointType`
    #   must be `VPC` and the `IdentityProviderType` must be
    #   `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE` or `API_GATEWAY`.
    #
    #    If `Protocol` includes `FTP`, then `AddressAllocationIds` cannot be
    #   associated.
    #
    #    If `Protocol` is set only to `SFTP`, the `EndpointType` can be set to
    #   `PUBLIC` and the `IdentityProviderType` can be set to
    #   `SERVICE_MANAGED`.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    # @option params [Types::ProtocolDetails] :protocol_details
    #   The protocol settings that are configured for your server.
    #
    #   Use the `PassiveIp` parameter to indicate passive mode (for FTP and
    #   FTPS protocols). Enter a single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the
    #   external IP address of a firewall, router, or load balancer.
    #
    #   Use the `TlsSessionResumptionMode` parameter to determine whether or
    #   not your Transfer server resumes recent, negotiated sessions through a
    #   unique session ID.
    #
    # @option params [String] :security_policy_name
    #   Specifies the name of the security policy that is attached to the
    #   server.
    #
    # @option params [Array<Types::Tag>] :tags
    #   Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for servers.
    #
    # @option params [Types::WorkflowDetails] :workflow_details
    #   Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the execution
    #   role used for executing the workflow.
    #
    # @return [Types::CreateServerResponse] Returns a {Seahorse::Client::Response response} object which responds to the following methods:

    #
    # @option params [String] :home_directory
    #   The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the
    #   server using the client.
    #
    #   A `HomeDirectory` example is `/bucket_name/home/mydirectory`.
    #
    # @option params [String] :home_directory_type
    #   The type of landing directory (folder) you want your users' home
    #   directory to be when they log into the server. If you set it to
    #   `PATH`, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths
    #   as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it
    #   `LOGICAL`, you need to provide mappings in the `HomeDirectoryMappings`
    #   for how you want to make Amazon S3 or EFS paths visible to your users.
    #
    # @option params [Array<Types::HomeDirectoryMapEntry>] :home_directory_mappings
    #   Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS
    #   paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make
    #   them visible. You must specify the `Entry` and `Target` pair, where
    #   `Entry` shows how the path is made visible and `Target` is the actual
    #   Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is
    #   displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Amazon Web Services
    #   Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in
    #   `Target`. This value can only be set when `HomeDirectoryType` is set
    #   to *LOGICAL*.
    #
    #   The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example.
    #
    #   `[ \{ "Entry": "/directory1", "Target":
    #   "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" \} ]`
    #
    #   In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to
    #   lock your user down to the designated home directory ("`chroot`").
    #   To do this, you can set `Entry` to `/` and set `Target` to the
    #   HomeDirectory parameter value.
    #
    #   The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example for `chroot`.
    #
    #   `[ \{ "Entry:": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" \} ]`
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3
    #   or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon
    #   S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your
    #   directory. If using the CLI, use the `s3api` or `efsapi` call instead
    #   of `s3` or `efs` so you can use the put-object operation. For example,
    #   you use the following: `aws s3api put-object --bucket bucketname --key
    #   path/to/folder/`. Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a `/`
    #   for it to be considered a folder.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    # @option params [String] :policy
    #   A session policy for your user so that you can use the same IAM role
    #   across multiple users. This policy scopes down user access to portions
    #   of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this
    #   policy include `$\{Transfer:UserName\}`,
    #   `$\{Transfer:HomeDirectory\}`, and `$\{Transfer:HomeBucket\}`.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> This only applies when the domain of `ServerId` is S3. EFS does not
    #   use session policies.
    #
    #    For session policies, Amazon Web Services Transfer Family stores the
    #   policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
    #   the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the

    #   directory to be when they log into the server. If you set it to
    #   `PATH`, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths
    #   as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it
    #   `LOGICAL`, you need to provide mappings in the `HomeDirectoryMappings`
    #   for how you want to make Amazon S3 or EFS paths visible to your users.
    #
    # @option params [Array<Types::HomeDirectoryMapEntry>] :home_directory_mappings
    #   Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS
    #   paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make
    #   them visible. You must specify the `Entry` and `Target` pair, where
    #   `Entry` shows how the path is made visible and `Target` is the actual
    #   Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is
    #   displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Amazon Web Services
    #   Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in
    #   `Target`. This value can only be set when `HomeDirectoryType` is set
    #   to *LOGICAL*.
    #
    #   The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example.
    #
    #   `[ \{ "Entry": "/directory1", "Target":
    #   "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" \} ]`
    #
    #   In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to
    #   lock down your user to the designated home directory ("`chroot`").
    #   To do this, you can set `Entry` to `/` and set `Target` to the
    #   `HomeDirectory` parameter value.
    #
    #   The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example for `chroot`.
    #
    #   `[ \{ "Entry:": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" \} ]`
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3
    #   or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon
    #   S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your
    #   directory. If using the CLI, use the `s3api` or `efsapi` call instead
    #   of `s3` or `efs` so you can use the put-object operation. For example,
    #   you use the following: `aws s3api put-object --bucket bucketname --key
    #   path/to/folder/`. Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a `/`
    #   for it to be considered a folder.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    # @option params [String] :policy
    #   A session policy for your user so that you can use the same IAM role
    #   across multiple users. This policy scopes down user access to portions
    #   of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this
    #   policy include `$\{Transfer:UserName\}`,
    #   `$\{Transfer:HomeDirectory\}`, and `$\{Transfer:HomeBucket\}`.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> This only applies when the domain of `ServerId` is S3. EFS does not
    #   use session policies.
    #
    #    For session policies, Amazon Web Services Transfer Family stores the
    #   policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
    #   the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the
    #   `Policy` argument.

    # @option params [Types::ProtocolDetails] :protocol_details
    #   The protocol settings that are configured for your server.
    #
    #   Use the `PassiveIp` parameter to indicate passive mode (for FTP and
    #   FTPS protocols). Enter a single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the
    #   external IP address of a firewall, router, or load balancer.
    #
    #   Use the `TlsSessionResumptionMode` parameter to determine whether or
    #   not your Transfer server resumes recent, negotiated sessions through a
    #   unique session ID.
    #
    # @option params [Types::EndpointDetails] :endpoint_details
    #   The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are configured
    #   for your server. When you host your endpoint within your VPC, you can
    #   make it accessible only to resources within your VPC, or you can
    #   attach Elastic IP addresses and make it accessible to clients over the
    #   internet. Your VPC's default security groups are automatically
    #   assigned to your endpoint.
    #
    # @option params [String] :endpoint_type
    #   The type of endpoint that you want your server to use. You can choose
    #   to make your server's endpoint publicly accessible (PUBLIC) or host
    #   it inside your VPC. With an endpoint that is hosted in a VPC, you can
    #   restrict access to your server and resources only within your VPC or
    #   choose to make it internet facing by attaching Elastic IP addresses
    #   directly to it.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using
    #   `EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT` in your Amazon Web Servicesaccount if your
    #   account hasn't already done so before May 19, 2021. If you have
    #   already created servers with `EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT` in your
    #   Amazon Web Servicesaccount on or before May 19, 2021, you will not be
    #   affected. After this date, use `EndpointType`=`VPC`.
    #
    #    For more information, see
    #   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.
    #
    #    It is recommended that you use `VPC` as the `EndpointType`. With this
    #   endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three
    #   Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server's endpoint
    #   and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client's
    #   public IP address. This is not possible with `EndpointType` set to
    #   `VPC_ENDPOINT`.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    # @option params [String] :host_key
    #   The RSA private key as generated by `ssh-keygen -N "" -m PEM -f
    #   my-new-server-key`.
    #
    #   If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing
    #   server to a new server, don't update the host key. Accidentally
    #   changing a server's host key can be disruptive.
    #
    #   For more information, see [Change the host key for your SFTP-enabled
    #   server][1] in the *Amazon Web ServicesTransfer Family User Guide*.

    # @option params [Types::IdentityProviderDetails] :identity_provider_details
    #   An array containing all of the information required to call a
    #   customer's authentication API method.
    #
    # @option params [String] :logging_role
    #   Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services
    #   Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows a server to turn
    #   on Amazon CloudWatch logging for Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS events. When
    #   set, user activity can be viewed in your CloudWatch logs.
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :protocols
    #   Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file
    #   transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint. The
    #   available protocols are:
    #
    #   * Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP): File transfer over
    #     SSH
    #
    #   * File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS): File transfer with TLS
    #     encryption
    #
    #   * File Transfer Protocol (FTP): Unencrypted file transfer
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you select `FTPS`, you must choose a certificate stored in Amazon
    #   Web ServicesCertificate Manager (ACM) which will be used to identify
    #   your server when clients connect to it over FTPS.
    #
    #    If `Protocol` includes either `FTP` or `FTPS`, then the `EndpointType`
    #   must be `VPC` and the `IdentityProviderType` must be
    #   `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE` or `API_GATEWAY`.
    #
    #    If `Protocol` includes `FTP`, then `AddressAllocationIds` cannot be
    #   associated.
    #
    #    If `Protocol` is set only to `SFTP`, the `EndpointType` can be set to
    #   `PUBLIC` and the `IdentityProviderType` can be set to
    #   `SERVICE_MANAGED`.

    #
    # @option params [String] :home_directory
    #   The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the

    #
    #   A `HomeDirectory` example is `/bucket_name/home/mydirectory`.
    #
    # @option params [String] :home_directory_type
    #   The type of landing directory (folder) you want your users' home
    #   directory to be when they log into the server. If you set it to
    #   `PATH`, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths
    #   as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it
    #   `LOGICAL`, you need to provide mappings in the `HomeDirectoryMappings`
    #   for how you want to make Amazon S3 or EFS paths visible to your users.
    #
    # @option params [Array<Types::HomeDirectoryMapEntry>] :home_directory_mappings
    #   Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS
    #   paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make
    #   them visible. You must specify the `Entry` and `Target` pair, where
    #   `Entry` shows how the path is made visible and `Target` is the actual
    #   Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is
    #   displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Amazon Web Services
    #   Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in
    #   `Target`. This value can only be set when `HomeDirectoryType` is set
    #   to *LOGICAL*.
    #
    #   The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example.
    #
    #   `[ \{ "Entry": "/directory1", "Target":
    #   "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" \} ]`
    #
    #   In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to
    #   lock down your user to the designated home directory ("`chroot`").
    #   To do this, you can set `Entry` to '/' and set `Target` to the
    #   HomeDirectory parameter value.
    #
    #   The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example for `chroot`.
    #
    #   `[ \{ "Entry:": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" \} ]`
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3
    #   or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon
    #   S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your
    #   directory. If using the CLI, use the `s3api` or `efsapi` call instead
    #   of `s3` or `efs` so you can use the put-object operation. For example,
    #   you use the following: `aws s3api put-object --bucket bucketname --key
    #   path/to/folder/`. Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a `/`
    #   for it to be considered a folder.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    # @option params [String] :policy
    #   A session policy for your user so that you can use the same IAM role
    #   across multiple users. This policy scopes down user access to portions
    #   of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this
    #   policy include `$\{Transfer:UserName\}`,
    #   `$\{Transfer:HomeDirectory\}`, and `$\{Transfer:HomeBucket\}`.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> This only applies when the domain of `ServerId` is S3. EFS does not
    #   use session policies.
    #
    #    For session policies, Amazon Web Services Transfer Family stores the
    #   policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
    #   the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the
    #   `Policy` argument.
    #
    #    For an example of a session policy, see [Creating a session
    #   policy][1].

    # @option params [Types::PosixProfile] :posix_profile
    #   Specifies the full POSIX identity, including user ID (`Uid`), group ID
    #   (`Gid`), and any secondary groups IDs (`SecondaryGids`), that controls
    #   your users' access to your Amazon Elastic File Systems (Amazon EFS).
    #   The POSIX permissions that are set on files and directories in your

    #
    # @option params [String] :role
    #   Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that controls
    #   your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS file system. The
    #   policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you
    #   want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of
    #   your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS file system. The IAM role should also

    #   and a maximum of 100 characters long. The following are valid
    #   characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, underscore '\_', hyphen '-', period
