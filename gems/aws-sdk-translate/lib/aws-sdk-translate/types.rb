    #
    #   To have Amazon Translate determine the source language of your text,
    #   you can specify `auto` in the `SourceLanguageCode` field. If you
    #   specify `auto`, Amazon Translate will call [Amazon Comprehend][1] to
    #   determine the source language.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you specify `auto`, you must send the `TranslateText` request in
    #   a region that supports Amazon Comprehend. Otherwise, the request
    #   returns an error indicating that autodetect is not supported.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] formality
    #   You can optionally specify the desired level of formality for
    #   real-time translations to supported target languages. The formality
    #   setting controls the level of formal language usage (also known as
    #   [register][1]) in the translation output. You can set the value to
    #   informal or formal. If you don't specify a value for formality, or
    #   if the target language doesn't support formality, the translation
    #   will ignore the formality setting.
    #
    #   Note that asynchronous translation jobs don't support formality. If
    #   you provide a value for formality, the `StartTextTranslationJob` API
    #   throws an exception (InvalidRequestException).
    #
    #   For target languages that support formality, see [Supported
    #   Languages and Language Codes in the Amazon Translate Developer
    #   Guide][2].

    # @!attribute [rw] profanity
    #   Enable the profanity setting if you want Amazon Translate to mask
    #   profane words and phrases in your translation output.
    #
    #   To mask profane words and phrases, Amazon Translate replaces them
    #   with the grawlix string “?$#@$“. This 5-character sequence is used
    #   for each profane word or phrase, regardless of the length or number
    #   of words.
    #
    #   Amazon Translate doesn't detect profanity in all of its supported
    #   languages. For languages that support profanity detection, see
    #   [Supported Languages and Language Codes in the Amazon Translate
    #   Developer Guide][1].
