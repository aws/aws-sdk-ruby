    #   for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error
    #   is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending

    #   If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an association
    #   while Systems Manager is running `MaxConcurrency` associations, the
    #   association is allowed to run. During the next association interval,

    #   The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify

    #   the association execution to determine the compliance status. If the
    #   association execution runs successfully, then the association is
    #   `COMPLIANT`. If the association execution doesn't run successfully,
    #   the association is `NON-COMPLIANT`.

    # For keys, you can specify one or more tags that have been applied to a

    # You can also use Amazon Web Services-provided keys, some of which have

    #
    # DocumentType
    # : * `ApplicationConfiguration`
    #
    #   * `ApplicationConfigurationSchema`
    #
    #   * `Automation`

    #   * `ChangeCalendar`
    #
    #   * `Command`
    #
    #   * `Package`
    #
    #   * `Policy`
    #
    #   * `Session`
    #
    # Owner
    #
    # : Note that only one `Owner` can be specified in a request. For
    #   example: `Key=Owner,Values=Self`.
    #
    #   * `Amazon`
    #
    #   * `Private`
    #
    #   * `Public`
    #
    #   * `Self`
    #
    #   * `ThirdParty`
    #
    # PlatformTypes
    # : * `Linux`
    #
    #   * `Windows`
    #
    # `Name` is another Amazon Web Services-provided key. If you use `Name`
    # as a key, you can use a name prefix to return a list of documents. For
    # example, in the Amazon Web Services CLI, to return a list of all
    # documents that begin with `Te`, run the following command:
    #
    # `aws ssm list-documents --filters Key=Name,Values=Te`
    #
    # You can also use the `TargetType` Amazon Web Services-provided key.
    # For a list of valid resource type values that can be used with this
    # key, see [Amazon Web Services resource and property types
    # reference][1] in the *CloudFormation User Guide*.
    #
    # If you specify more than two keys, only documents that are identified
    # by all the tags are returned in the results. If you specify more than
    # two values for a key, documents that are identified by any of the
    # values are returned in the results.
    #
    # To specify a custom key-value pair, use the format
    # `Key=tag:tagName,Values=valueName`.
    #
    # For example, if you created a key called region and are using the
    # Amazon Web Services CLI to call the `list-documents` command:
    #
    # `aws ssm list-documents --filters Key=tag:region,Values=east,west
    # Key=Owner,Values=Self`

    #
    #   * In Progress: The command has been sent to the managed node but
    #     hasn't reached a terminal state.
    #
    #   * Delayed: The system attempted to send the command to the target,
    #     but the target wasn't available. The managed node might not be
    #     available because of network issues, because the node was stopped,
    #     or for similar reasons. The system will try to send the command
    #     again.
    #
    #   * Success: The command or plugin ran successfully. This is a
    #     terminal state.
    #
    #   * Delivery Timed Out: The command wasn't delivered to the managed
    #     node before the delivery timeout expired. Delivery timeouts don't
    #     count against the parent command's `MaxErrors` limit, but they do
    #     contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or
    #     Incomplete. This is a terminal state.
    #
    #   * Execution Timed Out: The command started to run on the managed
    #     node, but the execution wasn't complete before the timeout
    #     expired. Execution timeouts count against the `MaxErrors` limit of
    #     the parent command. This is a terminal state.
    #
    #   * Failed: The command wasn't run successfully on the managed node.
    #     For a plugin, this indicates that the result code wasn't zero.
    #     For a command invocation, this indicates that the result code for
    #     one or more plugins wasn't zero. Invocation failures count
    #     against the `MaxErrors` limit of the parent command. This is a
    #     terminal state.
    #
    #   * Cancelled: The command was terminated before it was completed.
    #     This is a terminal state.
    #
    #   * Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to the managed
    #     node. The node might not exist or might not be responding.
    #     Undeliverable invocations don't count against the parent
    #     command's `MaxErrors` limit and don't contribute to whether the
    #     parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal
    #     state.
    #
    #   * Terminated: The parent command exceeded its `MaxErrors` limit and
    #     subsequent command invocations were canceled by the system. This
    #     is a terminal state.

    # Operations engineers and IT professionals use Amazon Web Services
    # Systems Manager OpsCenter to view, investigate, and remediate
    # operational work items (OpsItems) impacting the performance and health
    # of their Amazon Web Services resources. OpsCenter is integrated with
    # Amazon EventBridge and Amazon CloudWatch. This means you can configure
    # these services to automatically create an OpsItem in OpsCenter when a
    # CloudWatch alarm enters the ALARM state or when EventBridge processes
    # an event from any Amazon Web Services service that publishes events.
    # Configuring Amazon CloudWatch alarms and EventBridge events to
    # automatically create OpsItems allows you to quickly diagnose and
    # remediate issues with Amazon Web Services resources from a single
    # console.
    #
    # To help you diagnose issues, each OpsItem includes contextually
    # relevant information such as the name and ID of the Amazon Web
    # Services resource that generated the OpsItem, alarm or event details,
    # alarm history, and an alarm timeline graph. For the Amazon Web
    # Services resource, OpsCenter aggregates information from Config,
    # CloudTrail logs, and EventBridge, so you don't have to navigate
    # across multiple console pages during your investigation. For more
    # information, see [OpsCenter][1] in the *Amazon Web Services Systems
    # Manager User Guide*.

    #   data. You enter operational data as key-value pairs. The key has a
    #   maximum length of 128 characters. The value has a maximum size of 20
    #   KB.
    #
    #   Operational data keys *can't* begin with the following: `amazon`,
    #   `aws`, `amzn`, `ssm`, `/amazon`, `/aws`, `/amzn`, `/ssm`.
    #
    #   You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the
    #   account or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means
    #   that all users with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as provided
    #   by the DescribeOpsItems API operation) can view and search on the
    #   specified data. Operational data that isn't searchable is only
    #   viewable by users who have access to the OpsItem (as provided by the
    #   GetOpsItem API operation).
    #
    #   Use the `/aws/resources` key in OperationalData to specify a related
    #   resource in the request. Use the `/aws/automations` key in

    #   must include a leading forward slash character (/) when you create
    #   or reference a parameter. For example:
    #   `/Dev/DBServer/MySQL/db-string13`
    #
    #   Naming Constraints:
    #
    #   * Parameter names are case sensitive.
    #
    #   * A parameter name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services
    #     Region
    #
    #   * A parameter name can't be prefixed with "`aws`" or "`ssm`"
    #     (case-insensitive).
    #
    #   * Parameter names can include only the following symbols and
    #     letters: `a-zA-Z0-9_.-`
    #
    #     In addition, the slash character ( / ) is used to delineate
    #     hierarchies in parameter names. For example:
    #     `/Dev/Production/East/Project-ABC/MyParameter`
    #
    #   * A parameter name can't include spaces.
    #
    #   * Parameter hierarchies are limited to a maximum depth of fifteen
    #     levels.
    #
    #   For additional information about valid values for parameter names,
    #   see [Creating Systems Manager parameters][1] in the *Amazon Web
    #   Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> The maximum length constraint listed below includes capacity for
    #   additional system attributes that aren't part of the name. The
    #   maximum length for a parameter name, including the full length of
    #   the parameter ARN, is 1011 characters. For example, the length of
    #   the following parameter name is 65 characters, not 20 characters:

    #   If you don't specify a key ID, the system uses the default key
    #   associated with your Amazon Web Services account.
    #
    #   * To use your default KMS key, choose the `SecureString` data type,
    #     and do *not* specify the `Key ID` when you create the parameter.
    #     The system automatically populates `Key ID` with your default KMS
    #     key.
    #
    #   * To use a custom KMS key, choose the `SecureString` data type with

    #   A regular expression used to validate the parameter value. For

    #   Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to

    #   parameter to identify the type of resource to which it applies, the
    #   environment, or the type of configuration data referenced by the
    #   parameter. In this case, you could specify the following key-value
    #   pairs:
    #
    #   * `Key=Resource,Value=S3bucket`
    #
    #   * `Key=OS,Value=Windows`
    #
    #   * `Key=ParameterType,Value=LicenseKey`

    #   @return [Array<Types::Tag>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] tier
    #   The parameter tier to assign to a parameter.
    #
    #   Parameter Store offers a standard tier and an advanced tier for
    #   parameters. Standard parameters have a content size limit of 4 KB
    #   and can't be configured to use parameter policies. You can create a
    #   maximum of 10,000 standard parameters for each Region in an Amazon
    #   Web Services account. Standard parameters are offered at no
    #   additional cost.
    #
    #   Advanced parameters have a content size limit of 8 KB and can be
    #   configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of
    #   100,000 advanced parameters for each Region in an Amazon Web
    #   Services account. Advanced parameters incur a charge. For more
    #   information, see [Standard and advanced parameter tiers][1] in the
    #   *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.
    #
    #   You can change a standard parameter to an advanced parameter any
    #   time. But you can't revert an advanced parameter to a standard
    #   parameter. Reverting an advanced parameter to a standard parameter
    #   would result in data loss because the system would truncate the size
    #   of the parameter from 8 KB to 4 KB. Reverting would also remove any
    #   policies attached to the parameter. Lastly, advanced parameters use
    #   a different form of encryption than standard parameters.
    #
    #   If you no longer need an advanced parameter, or if you no longer
    #   want to incur charges for an advanced parameter, you must delete it
    #   and recreate it as a new standard parameter.
    #
    #   **Using the Default Tier Configuration**
    #
    #   In `PutParameter` requests, you can specify the tier to create the
    #   parameter in. Whenever you specify a tier in the request, Parameter
    #   Store creates or updates the parameter according to that request.
    #   However, if you don't specify a tier in a request, Parameter Store
    #   assigns the tier based on the current Parameter Store default tier
    #   configuration.
    #
    #   The default tier when you begin using Parameter Store is the
    #   standard-parameter tier. If you use the advanced-parameter tier, you
    #   can specify one of the following as the default:
    #
    #   * **Advanced**\: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates all
    #     requests as advanced parameters.
    #
    #   * **Intelligent-Tiering**\: With this option, Parameter Store
    #     evaluates each request to determine if the parameter is standard
    #     or advanced.
    #
    #     If the request doesn't include any options that require an
    #     advanced parameter, the parameter is created in the
    #     standard-parameter tier. If one or more options requiring an
    #     advanced parameter are included in the request, Parameter Store
    #     create a parameter in the advanced-parameter tier.
    #
    #     This approach helps control your parameter-related costs by always
    #     creating standard parameters unless an advanced parameter is
    #     necessary.
    #
    #   Options that require an advanced parameter include the following:
    #
    #   * The content size of the parameter is more than 4 KB.
    #
    #   * The parameter uses a parameter policy.
    #
    #   * More than 10,000 parameters already exist in your Amazon Web
    #     Services account in the current Amazon Web Services Region.
    #
    #   For more information about configuring the default tier option, see
    #   [Specifying a default parameter tier][2] in the *Amazon Web Services
    #   Systems Manager User Guide*.

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] policies
    #   One or more policies to apply to a parameter. This operation takes a
    #   JSON array. Parameter Store, a capability of Amazon Web Services
    #   Systems Manager supports the following policy types:
    #
    #   Expiration: This policy deletes the parameter after it expires. When
    #   you create the policy, you specify the expiration date. You can
    #   update the expiration date and time by updating the policy. Updating
    #   the *parameter* doesn't affect the expiration date and time. When
    #   the expiration time is reached, Parameter Store deletes the
    #   parameter.
    #
    #   ExpirationNotification: This policy initiates an event in Amazon
    #   CloudWatch Events that notifies you about the expiration. By using
    #   this policy, you can receive notification before or after the
    #   expiration time is reached, in units of days or hours.
    #
    #   NoChangeNotification: This policy initiates a CloudWatch Events
    #   event if a parameter hasn't been modified for a specified period of
    #   time. This policy type is useful when, for example, a secret needs
    #   to be changed within a period of time, but it hasn't been changed.
    #
    #   All existing policies are preserved until you send new policies or
    #   an empty policy. For more information about parameter policies, see
    #   [Assigning parameter policies][1].

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] data_type
    #   The data type for a `String` parameter. Supported data types include
    #   plain text and Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs.
    #
    #   **The following data type values are supported.**
    #
    #   * `text`
    #
    #   * `aws:ec2:image`
    #
    #   * `aws:ssm:integration`
    #
    #   When you create a `String` parameter and specify `aws:ec2:image`,
    #   Amazon Web Services Systems Manager validates the parameter value is
    #   in the required format, such as `ami-12345abcdeEXAMPLE`, and that
    #   the specified AMI is available in your Amazon Web Services account.
    #   For more information, see [Native parameter support for Amazon
    #   Machine Image (AMI) IDs][1] in the *Amazon Web Services Systems
    #   Manager User Guide*.

    #
    #   State Manager doesn't support running associations that use a new
    #   version of a document if that document is shared from another
    #   account. State Manager always runs the `default` version of a
    #   document if shared from another account, even though the Systems

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] name
    #   The name of the SSM Command document or Automation runbook that
    #   contains the configuration information for the managed node.
    #
    #   You can specify Amazon Web Services-predefined documents, documents
    #   you created, or a document that is shared with you from another
    #   account.
    #
    #   For Systems Manager document (SSM document) that are shared with you
    #   from other Amazon Web Services accounts, you must specify the
    #   complete SSM document ARN, in the following format:
    #
    #   `arn:aws:ssm:region:account-id:document/document-name `
    #
    #   For example:
    #
    #   `arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document`
    #
    #   For Amazon Web Services-predefined documents and SSM documents you
    #   created in your account, you only need to specify the document name.
    #   For example, `AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline` or `My-Document`.
    #   @return [String]

    # @!attribute [rw] targets
    #   The targets of the association.
    #   @return [Array<Types::Target>]

    #   The name of the association that you want to update.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] association_version
    #   This parameter is provided for concurrency control purposes. You
    #   must specify the latest association version in the service. If you
    #   want to ensure that this request succeeds, either specify `$LATEST`,
    #   or omit this parameter.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] automation_target_parameter_name
    #   Choose the parameter that will define how your automation will
    #   branch out. This target is required for associations that use an
    #   Automation runbook and target resources by using rate controls.
    #   Automation is a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] max_errors
    #   The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops
    #   sending requests to run the association on additional targets. You
    #   can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or
    #   a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3,
    #   for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error
    #   is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending
    #   requests after the first error is returned. If you run an
    #   association on 50 managed nodes and set `MaxError` to 10%, then the
    #   system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received.
    #
    #   Executions that are already running an association when `MaxErrors`
    #   is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may
    #   fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than
    #   max-errors failed executions, set `MaxConcurrency` to 1 so that
    #   executions proceed one at a time.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] max_concurrency
    #   The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the
    #   same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage
    #   of the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which
    #   means all targets run the association at the same time.
    #
    #   If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an association
    #   while Systems Manager is running `MaxConcurrency` associations, the
    #   association is allowed to run. During the next association interval,
    #   the new managed node will process its association within the limit
    #   specified for `MaxConcurrency`.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] compliance_severity
    #   The severity level to assign to the association.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] sync_compliance
    #   The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify
    #   `AUTO` or `MANUAL`. In `AUTO` mode, the system uses the status of
    #   the association execution to determine the compliance status. If the
    #   association execution runs successfully, then the association is
    #   `COMPLIANT`. If the association execution doesn't run successfully,
    #   the association is `NON-COMPLIANT`.
    #
    #   In `MANUAL` mode, you must specify the `AssociationId` as a
    #   parameter for the PutComplianceItems API operation. In this case,
    #   compliance data isn't managed by State Manager, a capability of
    #   Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. It is managed by your direct
    #   call to the PutComplianceItems API operation.
    #
    #   By default, all associations use `AUTO` mode.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] apply_only_at_cron_interval
    #   By default, when you update an association, the system runs it
    #   immediately after it is updated and then according to the schedule
    #   you specified. Specify this option if you don't want an association
    #   to run immediately after you update it. This parameter isn't
    #   supported for rate expressions.
    #
    #   Also, if you specified this option when you created the association,
    #   you can reset it. To do so, specify the
    #   `no-apply-only-at-cron-interval` parameter when you update the
    #   association from the command line. This parameter forces the
    #   association to run immediately after updating it and according to
    #   the interval specified.
    #   @return [Boolean]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] calendar_names
    #   The names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change Calendar
    #   type documents you want to gate your associations under. The
    #   associations only run when that change calendar is open. For more

    #
    #   You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the
    #   account or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means
    #   that all users with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as provided
    #   by the DescribeOpsItems API operation) can view and search on the
