    # An object that contains details about when a principal in the reported

    # user within the reported Organizations entity.

    #   The namespace of the service in which access was attempted.
    #
    #   To learn the service namespace of a service, go to [Actions,

    #   example, `(service prefix: a4b)`. For more information about service
    #   namespaces, see [AWS Service Namespaces][2] in the *AWS General
    #   Reference*.

    #   (OIDC) identity provider's server certificates. Typically this list
    #   includes only one entry. However, IAM lets you have up to five
    #   thumbprints for an OIDC provider. This lets you maintain multiple
    #   thumbprints if the identity provider is rotating certificates.
    #
    #   The server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash
    #   value of the X.509 certificate used by the domain where the OpenID
    #   Connect provider makes its keys available. It is always a
    #   40-character string.
    #
    #   You must provide at least one thumbprint when creating an IAM OIDC
    #   provider. For example, assume that the OIDC provider is
    #   `server.example.com` and the provider stores its keys at
    #   https://keys.server.example.com/openid-connect. In that case, the
    #   thumbprint string would be the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the
    #   certificate used by https://keys.server.example.com.

    #   The maximum session duration (in seconds) that you want to set for
    #   the specified role. If you do not specify a value for this setting,
    #   the default maximum of one hour is applied. This setting can have a
    #   value from 1 hour to 12 hours.
    #
    #   Anyone who assumes the role from the AWS CLI or API can use the
    #   `DurationSeconds` API parameter or the `duration-seconds` CLI
    #   parameter to request a longer session. The `MaxSessionDuration`
    #   setting determines the maximum duration that can be requested using
    #   the `DurationSeconds` parameter. If users don't specify a value for
    #   the `DurationSeconds` parameter, their security credentials are
    #   valid for one hour by default. This applies when you use the
    #   `AssumeRole*` API operations or the `assume-role*` CLI operations
    #   but does not apply when you use those operations to create a console
    #   URL. For more information, see [Using IAM Roles][1] in the *IAM User

    #   This affects [last sign-in][1] dates shown in the IAM console and
    #   password last used dates in the [IAM credential report][2], and
    #   returned by this GetUser API. If users signed in during the affected
    #   time, the password last used date that is returned is the date the

    #   after May 23, 2018 14:08 PDT, the returned password last used date
    #   is accurate.
    #
    #    You can use password last used information to identify unused
    #   credentials for deletion. For example, you might delete users who
    #   did not sign in to AWS in the last 90 days. In cases like this, we
    #   recommend that you adjust your evaluation window to include dates
    #   after May 23, 2018. Alternatively, if your users use access keys to
    #   access AWS programmatically you can refer to access key last used
    #   information because it is accurate for all dates.

    #   An ARN representing the AWS account ID that specifies the owner of
