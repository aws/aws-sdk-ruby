    #   The ID of the client application user. Amazon Lex uses this to

    #
    #   To decide the user ID to use for your application, consider the
    #   following factors.
    #
    #   * The `userID` field must not contain any personally identifiable
    #     information of the user, for example, name, personal
    #     identification numbers, or other end user personal information.
    #
    #   * If you want a user to start a conversation on one device and
    #     continue on another device, use a user-specific identifier.
    #
    #   * If you want the same user to be able to have two independent
    #     conversations on two different devices, choose a device-specific
    #     identifier.
    #
    #   * A user can't have two independent conversations with two
    #     different versions of the same bot. For example, a user can't
    #     have a conversation with the PROD and BETA versions of the same
    #     bot. If you anticipate that a user will need to have conversation
    #     with two different versions, for example, while testing, include
    #     the bot alias in the user ID to separate the two conversations.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] accept
    #   You pass this value as the `Accept` HTTP header.
    #
    #   The message Amazon Lex returns in the response can be either text or
    #   speech based on the `Accept` HTTP header value in the request.
    #
    #   * If the value is `text/plain; charset=utf-8`, Amazon Lex returns
    #     text in the response.
    #
    #   * If the value begins with `audio/`, Amazon Lex returns speech in
    #     the response. Amazon Lex uses Amazon Polly to generate the speech
    #     (using the configuration you specified in the `Accept` header).
    #     For example, if you specify `audio/mpeg` as the value, Amazon Lex
    #     returns speech in the MPEG format.
    #
    #     The following are the accepted values:
    #
    #     * audio/mpeg
    #
    #     * audio/ogg
    #
    #     * audio/pcm

    #   User input in PCM or Opus audio format or text format as described
    #   in the `Content-Type` HTTP header.
    #
    #   You can stream audio data to Amazon Lex or you can create a local
    #   buffer that captures all of the audio data before sending. In
    #   general, you get better performance if you stream audio data rather
    #   than buffering the data locally.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] slots
    #   Map of zero or more intent slots (name/value pairs) Amazon Lex
    #   detected from the user input during the conversation.
    #
    #   Amazon Lex creates a resolution list containing likely values for a
    #   slot. The value that it returns is determined by the
    #   `valueSelectionStrategy` selected when the slot type was created or
    #   updated. If `valueSelectionStrategy` is set to `ORIGINAL_VALUE`, the
    #   value provided by the user is returned, if the user value is similar
    #   to the slot values. If `valueSelectionStrategy` is set to
    #   `TOP_RESOLUTION` Amazon Lex returns the first value in the
    #   resolution list or, if there is no resolution list, null. If you
    #   don't specify a `valueSelectionStrategy`, the default is
    #   `ORIGINAL_VALUE`.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] session_attributes
    #   Map of key/value pairs representing the session-specific context
    #   information.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] message
    #   The message to convey to the user. The message can come from the
    #   bot's configuration or from a Lambda function.
    #
    #   If the intent is not configured with a Lambda function, or if the
    #   Lambda function returned `Delegate` as the `dialogAction.type` its
    #   response, Amazon Lex decides on the next course of action and
    #   selects an appropriate message from the bot's configuration based
    #   on the current interaction context. For example, if Amazon Lex
    #   isn't able to understand user input, it uses a clarification prompt
    #   message.
    #
    #   When you create an intent you can assign messages to groups. When
    #   messages are assigned to groups Amazon Lex returns one message from
    #   each group in the response. The message field is an escaped JSON
    #   string containing the messages. For more information about the
    #   structure of the JSON string returned, see msg-prompts-formats.
    #
    #   If the Lambda function returns a message, Amazon Lex passes it to
    #   the client in its response.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] message_format
    #   The format of the response message. One of the following values:
    #
    #   * `PlainText` - The message contains plain UTF-8 text.
    #
    #   * `CustomPayload` - The message is a custom format for the client.
    #
    #   * `SSML` - The message contains text formatted for voice output.
    #
    #   * `Composite` - The message contains an escaped JSON object
    #     containing one or more messages from the groups that messages were
    #     assigned to when the intent was created.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] dialog_state
    #   Identifies the current state of the user interaction. Amazon Lex
    #   returns one of the following values as `dialogState`. The client can
    #   optionally use this information to customize the user interface.
    #
    #   * `ElicitIntent` - Amazon Lex wants to elicit the user's intent.
    #     Consider the following examples:
    #
    #     For example, a user might utter an intent ("I want to order a
    #     pizza"). If Amazon Lex cannot infer the user intent from this
    #     utterance, it will return this dialog state.
    #
    #   * `ConfirmIntent` - Amazon Lex is expecting a "yes" or "no"
    #     response.
    #
    #     For example, Amazon Lex wants user confirmation before fulfilling
    #     an intent. Instead of a simple "yes" or "no" response, a user
    #     might respond with additional information. For example, "yes, but
    #     make it a thick crust pizza" or "no, I want to order a drink."
    #     Amazon Lex can process such additional information (in these
    #     examples, update the crust type slot or change the intent from
    #     OrderPizza to OrderDrink).
    #
    #   * `ElicitSlot` - Amazon Lex is expecting the value of a slot for the
    #     current intent.
    #
    #     For example, suppose that in the response Amazon Lex sends this
    #     message: "What size pizza would you like?". A user might reply
    #     with the slot value (e.g., "medium"). The user might also
    #     provide additional information in the response (e.g., "medium
    #     thick crust pizza"). Amazon Lex can process such additional
    #     information appropriately.
    #
    #   * `Fulfilled` - Conveys that the Lambda function has successfully
    #     fulfilled the intent.
    #
    #   * `ReadyForFulfillment` - Conveys that the client has to fulfill the
    #     request.
    #
    #   * `Failed` - Conveys that the conversation with the user failed.
    #
    #     This can happen for various reasons, including that the user does
    #     not provide an appropriate response to prompts from the service
    #     (you can configure how many times Amazon Lex can prompt a user for
    #     specific information), or if the Lambda function fails to fulfill
    #     the intent.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] slot_to_elicit
    #   If the `dialogState` value is `ElicitSlot`, returns the name of the
    #   slot for which Amazon Lex is eliciting a value.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] input_transcript
    #   The text used to process the request.
    #
    #   If the input was an audio stream, the `inputTranscript` field
    #   contains the text extracted from the audio stream. This is the text
    #   that is actually processed to recognize intents and slot values. You
    #   can use this information to determine if Amazon Lex is correctly
    #   processing the audio that you send.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] audio_stream
    #   The prompt (or statement) to convey to the user. This is based on
    #   the bot configuration and context. For example, if Amazon Lex did
    #   not understand the user intent, it sends the `clarificationPrompt`
    #   configured for the bot. If the intent requires confirmation before
    #   taking the fulfillment action, it sends the `confirmationPrompt`.
    #   Another example: Suppose that the Lambda function successfully
    #   fulfilled the intent, and sent a message to convey to the user. Then
    #   Amazon Lex sends that message in the response.

    #     identification numbers, or other end user personal information.
    #
    #   * If you want a user to start a conversation on one device and
    #     continue on another device, use a user-specific identifier.
    #
    #   * If you want the same user to be able to have two independent
    #     conversations on two different devices, choose a device-specific
    #     identifier.
    #
    #   * A user can't have two independent conversations with two

    # @!attribute [rw] dialog_state
    #   Identifies the current state of the user interaction. Amazon Lex
    #   returns one of the following values as `dialogState`. The client can
    #   optionally use this information to customize the user interface.
    #
    #   * `ElicitIntent` - Amazon Lex wants to elicit user intent.
    #
    #     For example, a user might utter an intent ("I want to order a
    #     pizza"). If Amazon Lex cannot infer the user intent from this
    #     utterance, it will return this dialogState.
    #
    #   * `ConfirmIntent` - Amazon Lex is expecting a "yes" or "no"
    #     response.
    #
    #     For example, Amazon Lex wants user confirmation before fulfilling
    #     an intent.
    #
    #     Instead of a simple "yes" or "no," a user might respond with
    #     additional information. For example, "yes, but make it thick
    #     crust pizza" or "no, I want to order a drink". Amazon Lex can
    #     process such additional information (in these examples, update the
    #     crust type slot value, or change intent from OrderPizza to
    #     OrderDrink).
    #
    #   * `ElicitSlot` - Amazon Lex is expecting a slot value for the
    #     current intent.
    #
    #     For example, suppose that in the response Amazon Lex sends this
    #     message: "What size pizza would you like?". A user might reply
    #     with the slot value (e.g., "medium"). The user might also
    #     provide additional information in the response (e.g., "medium
    #     thick crust pizza"). Amazon Lex can process such additional
    #     information appropriately.
    #
    #   * `Fulfilled` - Conveys that the Lambda function configured for the
    #     intent has successfully fulfilled the intent.
    #
    #   * `ReadyForFulfillment` - Conveys that the client has to fulfill the
    #     intent.
    #
    #   * `Failed` - Conveys that the conversation with the user failed.
    #
    #     This can happen for various reasons including that the user did
    #     not provide an appropriate response to prompts from the service
    #     (you can configure how many times Amazon Lex can prompt a user for
    #     specific information), or the Lambda function failed to fulfill
    #     the intent.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] slot_to_elicit
    #   If the `dialogState` value is `ElicitSlot`, returns the name of the
    #   slot for which Amazon Lex is eliciting a value.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] response_card
    #   Represents the options that the user has to respond to the current
    #   prompt. Response Card can come from the bot configuration (in the
    #   Amazon Lex console, choose the settings button next to a slot) or
    #   from a code hook (Lambda function).
    #   @return [Types::ResponseCard]
