    # Specifies a decision made by the decider. A decision can be one of
    # these types:
    #
    # * `CancelTimer` – Cancels a previously started timer and records a
    #   `TimerCanceled` event in the history.
    #
    # * `CancelWorkflowExecution` – Closes the workflow execution and
    #   records a `WorkflowExecutionCanceled` event in the history.
    #
    # * `CompleteWorkflowExecution` – Closes the workflow execution and
    #   records a `WorkflowExecutionCompleted` event in the history .
    #
    # * `ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution` – Closes the workflow execution and
    #   starts a new workflow execution of the same type using the same
    #   workflow ID and a unique run Id. A `WorkflowExecutionContinuedAsNew`
    #   event is recorded in the history.
    #
    # * `FailWorkflowExecution` – Closes the workflow execution and records
    #   a `WorkflowExecutionFailed` event in the history.
    #
    # * `RecordMarker` – Records a `MarkerRecorded` event in the history.
    #   Markers can be used for adding custom information in the history for
    #   instance to let deciders know that they don't need to look at the
    #   history beyond the marker event.
    #
    # * `RequestCancelActivityTask` – Attempts to cancel a previously
    #   scheduled activity task. If the activity task was scheduled but has
    #   not been assigned to a worker, then it is canceled. If the activity
    #   task was already assigned to a worker, then the worker is informed
    #   that cancellation has been requested in the response to
    #   RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat.
    #
    # * `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution` – Requests that a request
    #   be made to cancel the specified external workflow execution and
    #   records a `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated` event in
    #   the history.
    #
    # * `ScheduleActivityTask` – Schedules an activity task.
    #
    # * `SignalExternalWorkflowExecution` – Requests a signal to be
    #   delivered to the specified external workflow execution and records a
    #   `SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated` event in the history.
    #
    # * `StartChildWorkflowExecution` – Requests that a child workflow
    #   execution be started and records a
    #   `StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated` event in the history. The
    #   child workflow execution is a separate workflow execution with its
    #   own history.
    #
    # * `StartTimer` – Starts a timer for this workflow execution and
    #   records a `TimerStarted` event in the history. This timer fires
    #   after the specified delay and record a `TimerFired` event.
    #
    # **Access Control**
    #
    # If you grant permission to use `RespondDecisionTaskCompleted`, you can
    # use IAM policies to express permissions for the list of decisions
    # returned by this action as if they were members of the API. Treating
    # decisions as a pseudo API maintains a uniform conceptual model and
    # helps keep policies readable. For details and example IAM policies,
    # see [Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows][1] in the
    # *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.
    #
    # **Decision Failure**
    #
    # Decisions can fail for several reasons
    #
    # * The ordering of decisions should follow a logical flow. Some
    #   decisions might not make sense in the current context of the
    #   workflow execution and therefore fails.
    #
    # * A limit on your account was reached.
    #
    # * The decision lacks sufficient permissions.
    #
    # One of the following events might be added to the history to indicate
    # an error. The event attribute's `cause` parameter indicates the
    # cause. If `cause` is set to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`, the decision
    # failed because it lacked sufficient permissions. For details and
    # example IAM policies, see [Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF
    # Workflows][1] in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.
    #
    # * `ScheduleActivityTaskFailed` – A `ScheduleActivityTask` decision
    #   failed. This could happen if the activity type specified in the
    #   decision isn't registered, is in a deprecated state, or the
    #   decision isn't properly configured.
    #
    # * `RequestCancelActivityTaskFailed` – A `RequestCancelActivityTask`
    #   decision failed. This could happen if there is no open activity task
    #   with the specified activityId.
    #
    # * `StartTimerFailed` – A `StartTimer` decision failed. This could
    #   happen if there is another open timer with the same timerId.
    #
    # * `CancelTimerFailed` – A `CancelTimer` decision failed. This could
    #   happen if there is no open timer with the specified timerId.
    #
    # * `StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed` – A
    #   `StartChildWorkflowExecution` decision failed. This could happen if
    #   the workflow type specified isn't registered, is deprecated, or the
    #   decision isn't properly configured.
    #
    # * `SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed` – A
    #   `SignalExternalWorkflowExecution` decision failed. This could happen
    #   if the `workflowID` specified in the decision was incorrect.
    #
    # * `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed` – A
    #   `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution` decision failed. This could
    #   happen if the `workflowID` specified in the decision was incorrect.
    #
    # * `CancelWorkflowExecutionFailed` – A `CancelWorkflowExecution`
    #   decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision
    #   task pending in the workflow execution.
    #
    # * `CompleteWorkflowExecutionFailed` – A `CompleteWorkflowExecution`
    #   decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision
    #   task pending in the workflow execution.
    #
    # * `ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionFailed` – A
    #   `ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution` decision failed. This could happen
    #   if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow
    #   execution or the ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution decision was not
    #   configured correctly.
    #
    # * `FailWorkflowExecutionFailed` – A `FailWorkflowExecution` decision
    #   failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task
    #   pending in the workflow execution.
    #
    # The preceding error events might occur due to an error in the decider
    # logic, which might put the workflow execution in an unstable state The
    # cause field in the event structure for the error event indicates the
    # cause of the error.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> A workflow execution may be closed by the decider by returning one of
    # the following decisions when completing a decision task:
    # `CompleteWorkflowExecution`, `FailWorkflowExecution`,
    # `CancelWorkflowExecution` and `ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution`. An
    # `UnhandledDecision` fault is returned if a workflow closing decision
    # is specified and a signal or activity event had been added to the
    # history while the decision task was being performed by the decider.
    # Unlike the above situations which are logic issues, this fault is
    # always possible because of race conditions in a distributed system.
    # The right action here is to call RespondDecisionTaskCompleted without
    # any decisions. This would result in another decision task with these
    # new events included in the history. The decider should handle the new
    # events and may decide to close the workflow execution.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # **How to Code a Decision**
    #
    # You code a decision by first setting the decision type field to one of
    # the above decision values, and then set the corresponding attributes
    # field shown below:
    #
    # * ` ScheduleActivityTaskDecisionAttributes `
    #
    # * ` RequestCancelActivityTaskDecisionAttributes `
    #
    # * ` CompleteWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes `
    #
    # * ` FailWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes `

    # **Access Control**
    #
    # You can use IAM policies to control this decision's access to Amazon
    # SWF resources as follows:
    #
    # * Use a `Resource` element with the domain name to limit the action to
    #   only specified domains.
    #
    # * Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this
    #   action.

    # * You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.
    #
    # If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the
    # action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
    # constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's
    # `cause` parameter is set to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`. For details and

    # **Access Control**
    #
    # You can use IAM policies to control this decision's access to Amazon
    # SWF resources as follows:
    #
    # * Use a `Resource` element with the domain name to limit the action to
    #   only specified domains.
    #
    # * Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this
    #   action.
    #
    # * Constrain the following parameters by using a `Condition` element
    #   with the appropriate keys.
    #
    #   * `activityType.name` – String constraint. The key is
    #     `swf:activityType.name`.
    #
    #   * `activityType.version` – String constraint. The key is
    #     `swf:activityType.version`.
    #
    #   * `taskList` – String constraint. The key is `swf:taskList.name`.
    #
    # If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the
    # action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
    # constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's
    # `cause` parameter is set to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`. For details and
    # example IAM policies, see [Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF
    # Workflows][1] in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.

    #   The default task priority, specified when registering the workflow
    #   type, for all decision tasks of this workflow type. This default can
    #   be overridden when starting a workflow execution using the
    #   StartWorkflowExecution action or the `StartChildWorkflowExecution`
    #   decision.
    #
    #   Valid values are integers that range from Java's
    #   `Integer.MIN_VALUE` (-2147483648) to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`
    #   (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate higher priority.
    #
    #   For more information about setting task priority, see [Setting Task
    #   Priority][1] in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] default_child_policy
    #   The default policy to use for the child workflow executions when a
    #   workflow execution of this type is terminated, by calling the
    #   TerminateWorkflowExecution action explicitly or due to an expired
    #   timeout. This default can be overridden when starting a workflow
    #   execution using the StartWorkflowExecution action or the
    #   `StartChildWorkflowExecution` Decision.
    #
    #   The supported child policies are:
    #
    #   * `TERMINATE` – The child executions are terminated.
    #
    #   * `REQUEST_CANCEL` – A request to cancel is attempted for each child
    #     execution by recording a `WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` event
    #     in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate
    #     actions when it receives an execution history with this event.
    #
    #   * `ABANDON` – No action is taken. The child executions continue to
    #     run.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] default_lambda_role
    #   The default IAM role attached to this workflow type.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Executions of this workflow type need IAM roles to invoke Lambda
    #   functions. If you don't specify an IAM role when starting this
    #   workflow type, the default Lambda role is attached to the execution.
    #   For more information, see
    #   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/lambda-task.html][1]
    #   in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.
