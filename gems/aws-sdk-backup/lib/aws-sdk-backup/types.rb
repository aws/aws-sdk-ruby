    # @!attribute [rw] resource_type
    #   Specifies an object containing resource type and backup options. The
    #   only supported resource type is Amazon EC2 instances with Windows
    #   Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS). For a CloudFormation example, see
    #   the [sample CloudFormation template to enable Windows VSS][1] in the

    # @!attribute [rw] backup_options
    #   Specifies the backup option for a selected resource. This option is

    #
    #   Valid values:
    #
    #   Set to `"WindowsVSS":"enabled"` to enable the `WindowsVSS` backup
    #   option and create a Windows VSS backup.
    #
    #   Set to `"WindowsVSS":"disabled"` to create a regular backup. The
    #   `WindowsVSS` option is not enabled by default.
    #
    #   If you specify an invalid option, you get an
    #   `InvalidParameterValueException` exception.

    #   VSS-Enabled Windows Backup][1].

    #   Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage

    #   You need to specify specific metadata to restore an Amazon Elastic
    #   File System (Amazon EFS) instance:

    #     backed up by Backup. Returned in
    #     `GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata`.

    #     file system is encrypted. If `KmsKeyId` is specified, `Encrypted`
    #     must be set to `true`.
    #
    #   * `KmsKeyId`\: Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS key that is
    #     used to encrypt the restored file system. You can specify a key
    #     from another Amazon Web Services account provided that key it is
    #     properly shared with your account via Amazon Web Services KMS.
    #
    #   * `PerformanceMode`\: Specifies the throughput mode of the file
    #     system.
    #
    #   * `CreationToken`\: A user-supplied value that ensures the
    #     uniqueness (idempotency) of the request.
    #
    #   * `newFileSystem`\: A Boolean value that, if true, specifies that
    #     the recovery point is restored to a new Amazon EFS file system.
    #
    #   * `ItemsToRestore`\: An array of one to five strings where each
    #     string is a file path. Use `ItemsToRestore` to restore specific
    #     files or directories rather than the entire file system. This
    #     parameter is optional. For example,
