    # A list of backup options for each resource type.

    # @!attribute [rw] resource_type
    #   Specifies an object containing resource type and backup options. The
    #   only supported resource type is Amazon EC2 instances with Windows
    #   Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS). For a CloudFormation example, see
    #   the [sample CloudFormation template to enable Windows VSS][1] in the
    #   *Backup User Guide*.
    #
    #   Valid values: `EC2`.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] backup_options
    #   Specifies the backup option for a selected resource. This option is
    #   only available for Windows VSS backup jobs.
    #
    #   Valid values:
    #
    #   Set to `"WindowsVSS":"enabled"` to enable the `WindowsVSS` backup
    #   option and create a Windows VSS backup.
    #
    #   Set to `"WindowsVSS":"disabled"` to create a regular backup. The
    #   `WindowsVSS` option is not enabled by default.
    #
    #   If you specify an invalid option, you get an
    #   `InvalidParameterValueException` exception.
    #
    #   For more information about Windows VSS backups, see [Creating a
    #   VSS-Enabled Windows Backup][1].

    #   period on the recovery points in the vault (allowing indefinite

    #
    #   `STOPPED` status occurs on a continuous backup where a user has
    #   taken some action that causes the continuous backup to be disabled.
    #   This can be caused by the removal of permissions, turning off
    #   versioning, turning off events being sent to EventBridge, or
    #   disabling the EventBridge rules that are put in place by Backup.
    #
    #   To resolve `STOPPED` status, ensure that all requested permissions
    #   are in place and that versioning is enabled on the S3 bucket. Once
    #   these conditions are met, the next instance of a backup rule running
    #   will result in a new continuous recovery point being created. The
    #   recovery points with STOPPED status do not need to be deleted.
    #
    #   For SAP HANA on Amazon EC2 `STOPPED` status occurs due to user
    #   action, application misconfiguration, or backup failure. To ensure
    #   that future continuous backups succeed, refer to the recovery point
    #   status and check SAP HANA for details.

    #   if the original already exists.
    #
    #   You need to specify specific metadata to restore an Amazon Elastic
    #   File System (Amazon EFS) instance:
    #
    #   * `file-system-id`: The ID of the Amazon EFS file system that is

    #     must be set to `true`.
    #
    #   * `KmsKeyId`: Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS key that is used
