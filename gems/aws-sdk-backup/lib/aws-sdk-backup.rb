# This module provides support for AWS Backup. This module is available in the
# `aws-sdk-backup` gem.
#
# # Client
#
# The {Client} class provides one method for each API operation. Operation
# methods each accept a hash of request parameters and return a response
# structure.
#
#     backup = Aws::Backup::Client.new
#     resp = backup.create_backup_plan(params)
#
# See {Client} for more information.
#
# # Errors
#
# Errors returned from AWS Backup are defined in the
# {Errors} module and all extend {Errors::ServiceError}.
#
#     begin
#       # do stuff
#     rescue Aws::Backup::Errors::ServiceError
#       # rescues all AWS Backup API errors
#     end
