    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading static credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleWebIdentityCredentials` - Used when you need to
    #       assume a role after providing credentials via the web.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SSOCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from AWS SSO using an
    #       access token generated from `aws login`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ProcessCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       process that outputs to stdout.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ECSCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from
    #       instances running in ECS.
    #
    #     * `Aws::CognitoIdentityCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from the Cognito Identity service.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2/ECS IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts
    #       are very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #       `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` or `Aws::ECSCredentials` to
    #       enable retries and extended timeouts.

    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :adaptive_retry_wait_to_fill (true)
    #     Used only in `adaptive` retry mode.  When true, the request will sleep
    #     until there is sufficent client side capacity to retry the request.
    #     When false, the request will raise a `RetryCapacityNotAvailableError` and will
    #     not retry instead of sleeping.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :client_side_monitoring (false)
    #     When `true`, client-side metrics will be collected for all API requests from

    #
    #   @option options [Float] :retry_base_delay (0.3)
    #     The base delay in seconds used by the default backoff function. This option
    #     is only used in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [Symbol] :retry_jitter (:none)
    #     A delay randomiser function used by the default backoff function.
    #     Some predefined functions can be referenced by name - :none, :equal, :full,

    #     The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #     ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #     are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #     checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors, auth errors,
    #     endpoint discovery, and errors from expired credentials.
    #     This option is only used in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_max_delay (0)
    #     The maximum number of seconds to delay between retries (0 for no limit)
    #     used by the default backoff function. This option is only used in the
    #     `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :retry_mode ("legacy")
    #     Specifies which retry algorithm to use. Values are:
    #
    #     * `legacy` - The pre-existing retry behavior.  This is default value if
    #       no retry mode is provided.
    #
    #     * `standard` - A standardized set of retry rules across the AWS SDKs.
    #       This includes support for retry quotas, which limit the number of
    #       unsuccessful retries a client can make.
    #
    #     * `adaptive` - An experimental retry mode that includes all the
    #       functionality of `standard` mode along with automatic client side
    #       throttling.  This is a provisional mode that may change behavior
    #       in the future.
    #
    #
    #   @option options [String] :secret_access_key
    #
    #   @option options [String] :session_token
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :simple_json (false)
    #     Disables request parameter conversion, validation, and formatting.
    #     Also disable response data type conversions. This option is useful
    #     when you want to ensure the highest level of performance by
    #     avoiding overhead of walking request parameters and response data
    #     structures.
    #
    #     When `:simple_json` is enabled, the request parameters hash must
    #     be formatted exactly as the DynamoDB API expects.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #     Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #     fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #     the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #     {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #     ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #     requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #     When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #     sending the request.
    #
    #   @option options [URI::HTTP,String] :http_proxy A proxy to send
    #     requests through.  Formatted like 'http://proxy.com:123'.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_open_timeout (15) The number of
    #     seconds to wait when opening a HTTP session before raising a
    #     `Timeout::Error`.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :http_read_timeout (60) The default
    #     number of seconds to wait for response data.  This value can
    #     safely be set per-request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_idle_timeout (5) The number of
    #     seconds a connection is allowed to sit idle before it is
    #     considered stale.  Stale connections are closed and removed
    #     from the pool before making a request.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_continue_timeout (1) The number of
    #     seconds to wait for a 100-continue response before sending the
    #     request body.  This option has no effect unless the request has
    #     "Expect" header set to "100-continue".  Defaults to `nil` which
    #     disables this behaviour.  This value can safely be set per
    #     request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :http_wire_trace (false) When `true`,
    #     HTTP debug output will be sent to the `:logger`.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :ssl_verify_peer (true) When `true`,
    #     SSL peer certificates are verified when establishing a
    #     connection.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_bundle Full path to the SSL
    #     certificate authority bundle file that should be used when
    #     verifying peer certificates.  If you do not pass
    #     `:ssl_ca_bundle` or `:ssl_ca_directory` the the system default
    #     will be used if available.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_directory Full path of the
    #     directory that contains the unbundled SSL certificate
    #     authority files for verifying peer certificates.  If you do
    #     not pass `:ssl_ca_bundle` or `:ssl_ca_directory` the the
    #     system default will be used if available.

    # Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch
    # match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if
    # so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed
    # unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time
    # limit.
    #
    # When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in
    # the proposed match are placed into status `REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE`. This
    # is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the
    # ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this
    # status; all other acceptances result in an error.
    #
    # To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or
    # more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the
    # matchmaking tickets advance to status `PLACING`, where a new game
    # session is created for the match.
    #
    # If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received
    # before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The
    # matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets
    # where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket status is
    # returned to `SEARCHING` to find a new match. For tickets where one or
    # more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to
    # `CANCELLED`, and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request
    # for these players can be submitted as needed.

    # **This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and

    #
    # Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host
    # gameplay and players. This operation is called from a game client or
    # client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for
    # a new game session. In response, GameLift FleetIQ locates an available
    # game server, places it in `CLAIMED` status for 60 seconds, and returns
    # connection information that players can use to connect to the game
    # server.
    #
    # To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also
    # specify a game server ID, although this approach bypasses GameLift
    # FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass
    # to the game server at the start of a game session, such as a game map
    # or player information.
    #
    # When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is
    # returned. A claimed game server's utilization status remains
    # `AVAILABLE` while the claim status is set to `CLAIMED` for up to 60
    # seconds. This time period gives the game server time to update its
    # status to `UTILIZED` (using UpdateGameServer) once players join. If
    # the game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game
    # server reverts to unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by
    # another request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not
    # configurable.
    #
    # If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in
    # the following cases:
    #
    # * If the game server utilization status is `UTILIZED`.
    #
    # * If the game server claim status is `CLAIMED`.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> When claiming a specific game server, this request will succeed even
    # if the game server is running on an instance in `DRAINING` status. To
    # avoid this, first check the instance status by calling
    # DescribeGameServerInstances.

    # Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias
    # ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction
    # for a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one
    # fleet to another, such as when updating your game build.
    #
    # Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases:
    # simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A
    # terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead
    # of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a
    # terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want
    # to direct players to an upgrade site.
    #
    # To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and
    # optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet,
    # but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias
    # record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You can reassign
    # an alias to another fleet by calling `UpdateAlias`.

    # Creates a new Amazon GameLift build resource for your game server
    # binary files. Game server binaries must be combined into a zip file
    # for use with Amazon GameLift.
    #
    # When setting up a new game build for GameLift, we recommend using the
    # AWS CLI command <b> <a
    # href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift/upload-build.html">upload-build</a>
    # </b>. This helper command combines two tasks: (1) it uploads your
    # build files from a file directory to a GameLift Amazon S3 location,
    # and (2) it creates a new build resource.
    #
    # The `CreateBuild` operation can used in the following scenarios:
    #
    # * To create a new game build with build files that are in an S3
    #   location under an AWS account that you control. To use this option,
    #   you must first give Amazon GameLift access to the S3 bucket. With
    #   permissions in place, call `CreateBuild` and specify a build name,
    #   operating system, and the S3 storage location of your game build.
    #
    # * To directly upload your build files to a GameLift S3 location. To
    #   use this option, first call `CreateBuild` and specify a build name
    #   and operating system. This operation creates a new build resource
    #   and also returns an S3 location with temporary access credentials.
    #   Use the credentials to manually upload your build files to the
    #   specified S3 location. For more information, see [Uploading
    #   Objects][1] in the *Amazon S3 Developer Guide*. Build files can be
    #   uploaded to the GameLift S3 location once only; that can't be
    #   updated.
    #
    # If successful, this operation creates a new build resource with a
    # unique build ID and places it in `INITIALIZED` status. A build must be
    # in `READY` status before you can create fleets with it.

    # Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. whether they are custom
    # game builds or Realtime Servers with game-specific script. A fleet is
    # a set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of
    # which can host multiple game sessions. When creating a fleet, you
    # choose the hardware specifications, set some configuration options,
    # and specify the game server to deploy on the new fleet.
    #
    # To create a new fleet, provide the following: (1) a fleet name, (2) an
    # EC2 instance type and fleet type (spot or on-demand), (3) the build ID
    # for your game build or script ID if using Realtime Servers, and (4) a
    # runtime configuration, which determines how game servers will run on
    # each instance in the fleet.
    #
    # If the `CreateFleet` call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the
    # following tasks. You can track the process of a fleet by checking the
    # fleet status or by monitoring fleet creation events:
    #
    # * Creates a fleet resource. Status: `NEW`.
    #
    # * Begins writing events to the fleet event log, which can be accessed
    #   in the Amazon GameLift console.
    #
    # * Sets the fleet's target capacity to 1 (desired instances), which
    #   triggers Amazon GameLift to start one new EC2 instance.
    #
    # * Downloads the game build or Realtime script to the new instance and
    #   installs it. Statuses: `DOWNLOADING`, `VALIDATING`, `BUILDING`.
    #
    # * Starts launching server processes on the instance. If the fleet is
    #   configured to run multiple server processes per instance, Amazon
    #   GameLift staggers each process launch by a few seconds. Status:
    #   `ACTIVATING`.
    #
    # * Sets the fleet's status to `ACTIVE` as soon as one server process
    #   is ready to host a game session.

    #
    # @option params [String] :new_game_session_protection_policy
    #   A game session protection policy to apply to all instances in this

    #   to no protection. You can change a fleet's protection policy using
    #   UpdateFleetAttributes, but this change will only affect sessions
    #   created after the policy change. You can also set protection for
    #   individual instances using UpdateGameSession.
    #
    #   * **NoProtection** - The game session can be terminated during a

    #
    #   * **FullProtection** - If the game session is in an `ACTIVE` status,
    #     it cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.
    #
    # @option params [Types::RuntimeConfiguration] :runtime_configuration
    #   Instructions for launching server processes on each instance in the
    #   fleet. Server processes run either a custom game build executable or a
    #   Realtime script. The runtime configuration defines the server
    #   executables or launch script file, launch parameters, and the number
    #   of processes to run concurrently on each instance. When creating a
    #   fleet, the runtime configuration must have at least one server process
    #   configuration; otherwise the request fails with an invalid request
    #   exception. (This parameter replaces the parameters `ServerLaunchPath`
    #   and `ServerLaunchParameters`, although requests that contain values
    #   for these parameters instead of a runtime configuration will continue
    #   to work.) This parameter is required unless the parameters
    #   `ServerLaunchPath` and `ServerLaunchParameters` are defined. Runtime
    #   configuration replaced these parameters, but fleets that use them will
    #   continue to work.
    #
    # @option params [Types::ResourceCreationLimitPolicy] :resource_creation_limit_policy
    #   A policy that limits the number of game sessions an individual player
    #   can create over a span of time for this fleet.
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :metric_groups
    #   The name of an Amazon CloudWatch metric group to add this fleet to. A
    #   metric group aggregates the metrics for all fleets in the group.
    #   Specify an existing metric group name, or provide a new name to create
    #   a new metric group. A fleet can only be included in one metric group
    #   at a time.
    #
    # @option params [String] :peer_vpc_aws_account_id
    #   A unique identifier for the AWS account with the VPC that you want to
    #   peer your Amazon GameLift fleet with. You can find your account ID in
    #   the AWS Management Console under account settings.
    #
    # @option params [String] :peer_vpc_id
    #   A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by your
    #   Amazon GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as your
    #   fleet. To look up a VPC ID, use the [VPC Dashboard][1] in the AWS

    # **This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and
    # game server groups.**
    #
    # Creates a GameLift FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting
    # on a collection of Amazon EC2 instances for game hosting. This
    # operation creates the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group
    # in your AWS account, and establishes a link between the two groups.
    # You can view the status of your game server groups in the GameLift
    # console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon
    # CloudWatch.
    #
    # Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following:
    #
    # * An Amazon EC2 launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon
    #   EC2 instances with your game server build. For more information, see
    #   [ Launching an Instance from a Launch Template][1] in the *Amazon
    #   EC2 User Guide*.
    #
    # * An IAM role that extends limited access to your AWS account to allow
    #   GameLift FleetIQ to create and interact with the Auto Scaling group.
    #   For more information, see [Create IAM roles for cross-service
    #   interaction][2] in the *GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide*.
    #
    # To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name, IAM
    # role and Amazon EC2 launch template, and provide a list of instance
    # types that can be used in the group. You must also set initial maximum
    # and minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally
    # set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on a GameLift
    # FleetIQ metric.
    #
    # Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are
    # created, you have full access to change the Auto Scaling group's
    # configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating
    # a game server group, including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling
    # policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group.
    # Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically
    # updated by GameLift FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to
    # optimize for availability and cost.

    #   GameLift FleetIQ game server group. The name must be unique per Region
    #   per AWS account.
    #

    #
    # @option params [required, Integer] :min_size
    #   The minimum number of instances allowed in the EC2 Auto Scaling group.
    #   During automatic scaling events, GameLift FleetIQ and EC2 do not scale
    #   down the group below this minimum. In production, this value should be
    #   set to at least 1. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update
    #   this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or
    #   APIs.
    #
    # @option params [required, Integer] :max_size
    #   The maximum number of instances allowed in the EC2 Auto Scaling group.
    #   During automatic scaling events, GameLift FleetIQ and EC2 do not scale
    #   up the group above this maximum. After the Auto Scaling group is
    #   created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using
    #   the AWS console or APIs.
    #
    # @option params [required, Types::LaunchTemplateSpecification] :launch_template
    #   The EC2 launch template that contains configuration settings and game
    #   server code to be deployed to all instances in the game server group.
    #   You can specify the template using either the template name or ID. For
    #   help with creating a launch template, see [Creating a Launch Template
    #   for an Auto Scaling Group][1] in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User
    #   Guide*. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value

    #
    # @option params [required, Array<Types::InstanceDefinition>] :instance_definitions
    #   The EC2 instance types and sizes to use in the Auto Scaling group. The
    #   instance definitions must specify at least two different instance
    #   types that are supported by GameLift FleetIQ. For more information on
    #   instance types, see [EC2 Instance Types][1] in the *Amazon EC2 User
    #   Guide*. You can optionally specify capacity weighting for each
    #   instance type. If no weight value is specified for an instance type,
    #   it is set to the default value "1". For more information about
    #   capacity weighting, see [ Instance Weighting for Amazon EC2 Auto

    #
    # @option params [Types::GameServerGroupAutoScalingPolicy] :auto_scaling_policy
    #   Configuration settings to define a scaling policy for the Auto Scaling
    #   group that is optimized for game hosting. The scaling policy uses the
    #   metric `"PercentUtilizedGameServers"` to maintain a buffer of idle
    #   game servers that can immediately accommodate new games and players.
    #   After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in
    #   the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.
    #
    # @option params [String] :balancing_strategy
    #   Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and
    #   On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include
    #   the following:
    #
    #   * `SPOT_ONLY` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group.
    #     If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting,
    #     the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot
    #     Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are
    #     started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated
    #     (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.
    #
    #   * `SPOT_PREFERRED` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever
    #     available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are
    #     unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting
    #     capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable
    #     Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are
    #     replaced with new On-Demand Instances.
    #
    #   * `ON_DEMAND_ONLY` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game
    #     server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while
    #     this balancing strategy is in force.
    #
    # @option params [String] :game_server_protection_policy
    #   A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are
    #   protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have
    #   active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down
    #   event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected
    #   instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers
    #   running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion
    #   (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be
    #   terminated by AWS regardless of protection status. This property is
    #   set to `NO_PROTECTION` by default.
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :vpc_subnets
    #   A list of virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets to use with instances in
    #   the game server group. By default, all GameLift FleetIQ-supported
    #   Availability Zones are used. You can use this parameter to specify
    #   VPCs that you've set up. This property cannot be updated after the
    #   game server group is created, and the corresponding Auto Scaling group
    #   will always use the property value that is set with this request, even
    #   if the Auto Scaling group is updated directly.
    #
    # @option params [Array<Types::Tag>] :tags
    #   A list of labels to assign to the new game server group resource. Tags
    #   are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources is useful
    #   for resource management, access management, and cost allocation. For
    #   more information, see [ Tagging AWS Resources][1] in the *AWS General

    # Creates a multiplayer game session for players. This operation creates
    # a game session record and assigns an available server process in the
    # specified fleet to host the game session. A fleet must have an
    # `ACTIVE` status before a game session can be created in it.
    #
    # To create a game session, specify either fleet ID or alias ID and
    # indicate a maximum number of players to allow in the game session. You
    # can also provide a name and game-specific properties for this game
    # session. If successful, a GameSession object is returned containing
    # the game session properties and other settings you specified.
    #
    # **Idempotency tokens.** You can add a token that uniquely identifies
    # game session requests. This is useful for ensuring that game session
    # requests are idempotent. Multiple requests with the same idempotency
    # token are processed only once; subsequent requests return the original
    # result. All response values are the same with the exception of game
    # session status, which may change.
    #
    # **Resource creation limits.** If you are creating a game session on a
    # fleet with a resource creation limit policy in force, then you must
    # specify a creator ID. Without this ID, Amazon GameLift has no way to
    # evaluate the policy for this new game session request.
    #
    # **Player acceptance policy.** By default, newly created game sessions
    # are open to new players. You can restrict new player access by using
    # UpdateGameSession to change the game session's player session
    # creation policy.
    #
    # **Game session logs.** Logs are retained for all active game sessions
    # for 14 days. To access the logs, call GetGameSessionLogUrl to download
    # the log files.

    # Establishes a new queue for processing requests to place new game
    # sessions. A queue identifies where new game sessions can be hosted --
    # by specifying a list of destinations (fleets or aliases) -- and how
    # long requests can wait in the queue before timing out. You can set up
    # a queue to try to place game sessions on fleets in multiple Regions.
    # To add placement requests to a queue, call StartGameSessionPlacement
    # and reference the queue name.
    #
    # **Destination order.** When processing a request for a game session,
    # Amazon GameLift tries each destination in order until it finds one
    # with available resources to host the new game session. A queue's
    # default order is determined by how destinations are listed. The
    # default order is overridden when a game session placement request
    # provides player latency information. Player latency information
    # enables Amazon GameLift to prioritize destinations where players
    # report the lowest average latency, as a result placing the new game
    # session where the majority of players will have the best possible
    # gameplay experience.
    #
    # **Player latency policies.** For placement requests containing player
    # latency information, use player latency policies to protect individual
    # players from very high latencies. With a latency cap, even when a
    # destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is
    # not placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher
    # than a policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies,
    # which are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the
    # lowest latency cap. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency
    # controls; for example, you might set a policy with a low latency cap
    # for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher cap for the
    # next 60 seconds, etc.
    #
    # To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of
    # destinations and, if desired, a set of latency policies. If
    # successful, a new queue object is returned.

    #
    # @option params [Array<Types::PlayerLatencyPolicy>] :player_latency_policies
    #   A collection of latency policies to apply when processing game
    #   sessions placement requests with player latency information. Multiple
    #   policies are evaluated in order of the maximum latency value, starting
    #   with the lowest latency values. With just one policy, the policy is
    #   enforced at the start of the game session placement for the duration
    #   period. With multiple policies, each policy is enforced consecutively
    #   for its duration period. For example, a queue might enforce a
    #   60-second policy followed by a 120-second policy, and then no policy
    #   for the remainder of the placement. A player latency policy must set a
    #   value for `MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds`. If none is

    # Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch.
    # Whether your are using FlexMatch with GameLift hosting or as a
    # standalone matchmaking service, the matchmaking configuration sets out
    # rules for matching players and forming teams. If you're also using
    # GameLift hosting, it defines how to start game sessions for each
    # match. Your matchmaking system can use multiple configurations to
    # handle different game scenarios. All matchmaking requests
    # (StartMatchmaking or StartMatchBackfill) identify the matchmaking
    # configuration to use and provide player attributes consistent with
    # that configuration.
    #
    # To create a matchmaking configuration, you must provide the following:
    # configuration name and FlexMatch mode (with or without GameLift
    # hosting); a rule set that specifies how to evaluate players and find
    # acceptable matches; whether player acceptance is required; and the
    # maximum time allowed for a matchmaking attempt. When using FlexMatch
    # with GameLift hosting, you also need to identify the game session
    # queue to use when starting a game session for the match.
    #
    # In addition, you must set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service
    # (SNS) to receive matchmaking notifications, and provide the topic ARN
    # in the matchmaking configuration. An alternative method, continuously
    # polling ticket status with DescribeMatchmaking, is only suitable for
    # games in development with low matchmaking usage.

    # Creates a new script record for your Realtime Servers script. Realtime
    # scripts are JavaScript that provide configuration settings and
    # optional custom game logic for your game. The script is deployed when
    # you create a Realtime Servers fleet to host your game sessions. Script
    # logic is executed during an active game session.
    #
    # To create a new script record, specify a script name and provide the
    # script file(s). The script files and all dependencies must be zipped
    # into a single file. You can pull the zip file from either of these
    # locations:
    #
    # * A locally available directory. Use the *ZipFile* parameter for this
    #   option.
    #
    # * An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket under your AWS
    #   account. Use the *StorageLocation* parameter for this option.
    #   You'll need to have an Identity Access Management (IAM) role that
    #   allows the Amazon GameLift service to access your S3 bucket.
    #
    # If the call is successful, a new script record is created with a
    # unique script ID. If the script file is provided as a local file, the
    # file is uploaded to an Amazon GameLift-owned S3 bucket and the script
    # record's storage location reflects this location. If the script file
    # is provided as an S3 bucket, Amazon GameLift accesses the file at this
    # storage location as needed for deployment.

    #   location. The S3 bucket must be in the same Region where you are

    #   you can use the `ObjectVersion` parameter to specify an earlier
    #   version. To call this operation with a storage location, you must have

    # Establishes a VPC peering connection between a virtual private cloud
    # (VPC) in an AWS account with the VPC for your Amazon GameLift fleet.
    # VPC peering enables the game servers on your fleet to communicate
    # directly with other AWS resources. You can peer with VPCs in any AWS
    # account that you have access to, including the account that you use to
    # manage your Amazon GameLift fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are
    # in different Regions. For more information, see [VPC Peering with
    # Amazon GameLift Fleets][1].
    #
    # Before calling this operation to establish the peering connection, you
    # first need to call CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization and identify the VPC
    # you want to peer with. Once the authorization for the specified VPC is
    # issued, you have 24 hours to establish the connection. These two
    # operations handle all tasks necessary to peer the two VPCs, including
    # acceptance, updating routing tables, etc.
    #
    # To establish the connection, call this operation from the AWS account
    # that is used to manage the Amazon GameLift fleets. Identify the
    # following values: (1) The ID of the fleet you want to be enable a VPC
    # peering connection for; (2) The AWS account with the VPC that you want
    # to peer with; and (3) The ID of the VPC you want to peer with. This
    # operation is asynchronous. If successful, a VpcPeeringConnection
    # request is created. You can use continuous polling to track the
    # request's status using DescribeVpcPeeringConnections, or by

    # Terminates a game server group and permanently deletes the game server
    # group record. You have several options for how these resources are
    # impacted when deleting the game server group. Depending on the type of

    # resources:

    #

    #
    # To delete a game server group, identify the game server group to
    # delete and specify the type of delete operation to initiate. Game
    # server groups can only be deleted if they are in `ACTIVE` or `ERROR`
    # status.
    #
    # If the delete request is successful, a series of operations are kicked
    # off. The game server group status is changed to `DELETE_SCHEDULED`,
    # which prevents new game servers from being registered and stops
    # automatic scaling activity. Once all game servers in the game server
    # group are deregistered, GameLift FleetIQ can begin deleting resources.
    # If any of the delete operations fail, the game server group is placed
    # in `ERROR` status.

    # real time.
    #
    # To remotely access an instance, you need credentials that match the
    # operating system of the instance. For a Windows instance, Amazon
    # GameLift returns a user name and password as strings for use with a
    # Windows Remote Desktop client. For a Linux instance, Amazon GameLift
    # returns a user name and RSA private key, also as strings, for use with
    # an SSH client. The private key must be saved in the proper format to a
    # `.pem` file before using. If you're making this request using the AWS
    # CLI, saving the secret can be handled as part of the GetInstanceAccess
    # request, as shown in one of the examples for this operation.
    #
    # To request access to a specific instance, specify the IDs of both the
    # instance and the fleet it belongs to. You can retrieve a fleet's
    # instance IDs by calling DescribeInstances. If successful, an
    # InstanceAccess object is returned that contains the instance's IP
    # address and a set of credentials.

    # Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are
    # used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player
    # demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a
    # fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a
    # certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies:
    # target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and
    # efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly
    # used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained
    # control over auto-scaling.
    #
    # Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the
    # same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple
    # rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however,
    # because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended
    # consequences.
    #
    # You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by
    # calling StopFleetActions with the fleet action AUTO\_SCALING. To
    # resume scaling policies, call StartFleetActions with the same fleet
    # action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it,
    # you must delete the policy with DeleteScalingPolicy.
    #
    # Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in [Set Up Fleet
    # Automatic Scaling][1].
    #
    # **Target-based policy**
    #
    # A target-based policy tracks a single metric:
    # PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a
    # fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not
    # currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the
    # additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current
    # capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size
    # and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to
    # maintain that target.
    #
    # For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet
    # that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This
    # policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's
    # available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon
    # GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to
    # return to the 10% buffer.
    #
    # To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and
    # name, and set the policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric
    # to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a
    # TargetConfiguration object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all
    # other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is
    # returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as
    # it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are
    # temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet
    # actions are restarted.
    #
    # **Rule-based policy**
    #
    # A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold
    # value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered.
    # With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet
    # metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and
    # by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action.
    #
    # For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the
    # percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15
    # minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%."
    #
    # A policy's rule statement has the following structure:
    #
    # If `[MetricName]` is `[ComparisonOperator]` `[Threshold]` for
    # `[EvaluationPeriods]` minutes, then `[ScalingAdjustmentType]` to/by
    # `[ScalingAdjustment]`.
    #
    # To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:
    #
    # If `[PercentIdleInstances]` is `[GreaterThanThreshold]` `[20]` for
    # `[15]` minutes, then `[PercentChangeInCapacity]` to/by `[10]`.
    #
    # To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of
    # name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify
    # the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful
    # request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are
    # automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If
    # the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new
    # policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

    #     adjustment value.
    #
    #   * **PercentChangeInCapacity** -- increase or reduce the current
    #     instance count by the scaling adjustment, read as a percentage.
    #     Positive values scale up while negative values scale down; for
    #     example, a value of "-10" scales the fleet down by 10%.

    #     could host simultaneously, given current capacity.
    #
    #   * **AvailablePlayerSessions** -- Empty player slots in currently
    #     active game sessions. This includes game sessions that are not
    #     currently accepting players. Reserved player slots are not included.
    #

    #
    # Creates a new game server resource and notifies GameLift FleetIQ that
    # the game server is ready to host gameplay and players. This operation
    # is called by a game server process that is running on an instance in a
    # game server group. Registering game servers enables GameLift FleetIQ
    # to track available game servers and enables game clients and services
    # to claim a game server for a new game session.
    #
    # To register a game server, identify the game server group and instance
    # where the game server is running, and provide a unique identifier for
    # the game server. You can also include connection and game server data.
    # When a game client or service requests a game server by calling
    # ClaimGameServer, this information is returned in the response.
    #
    # Once a game server is successfully registered, it is put in status
    # `AVAILABLE`. A request to register a game server may fail if the
    # instance it is running on is in the process of shutting down as part
    # of instance balancing or scale-down activity.

    # Retrieves all active game sessions that match a set of search criteria
    # and sorts them in a specified order. You can search or sort by the
    # following game session attributes:
    #
    # * **gameSessionId** -- A unique identifier for the game session. You
    #   can use either a `GameSessionId` or `GameSessionArn` value.
    #
    # * **gameSessionName** -- Name assigned to a game session. This value
    #   is set when requesting a new game session with CreateGameSession or
    #   updating with UpdateGameSession. Game session names do not need to
    #   be unique to a game session.
    #
    # * **gameSessionProperties** -- Custom data defined in a game
    #   session's `GameProperty` parameter. `GameProperty` values are
    #   stored as key:value pairs; the filter expression must indicate the
    #   key and a string to search the data values for. For example, to
    #   search for game sessions with custom data containing the key:value
    #   pair "gameMode:brawl", specify the following:
    #   `gameSessionProperties.gameMode = "brawl"`. All custom data values
    #   are searched as strings.
    #
    # * **maximumSessions** -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for
    #   a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session
    #   with CreateGameSession or updating with UpdateGameSession.
    #
    # * **creationTimeMillis** -- Value indicating when a game session was
    #   created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.
    #
    # * **playerSessionCount** -- Number of players currently connected to a
    #   game session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session
    #   or drop out.
    #
    # * **hasAvailablePlayerSessions** -- Boolean value indicating whether a
    #   game session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly
    #   recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute
    #   to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players
    #   can join.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> Returned values for `playerSessionCount` and
    # `hasAvailablePlayerSessions` change quickly as players join sessions
    # and others drop out. Results should be considered a snapshot in time.
    # Be sure to refresh search results often, and handle sessions that fill
    # up before a player can join.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # To search or sort, specify either a fleet ID or an alias ID, and
    # provide a search filter expression, a sort expression, or both. If
    # successful, a collection of GameSession objects matching the request
    # is returned. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a
    # set of sequential pages.
    #
    # You can search for game sessions one fleet at a time only. To find
    # game sessions across multiple fleets, you must search each fleet
    # separately and combine the results. This search feature finds only
    # game sessions that are in `ACTIVE` status. To locate games in statuses
    # other than active, use DescribeGameSessionDetails.

    # @option params [String] :fleet_id
    #   A unique identifier for a fleet to search for active game sessions.
    #   You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. Each request must
    #   reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.
    #
    # @option params [String] :alias_id
    #   A unique identifier for an alias associated with the fleet to search
    #   for active game sessions. You can use either the alias ID or ARN
    #   value. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but
    #   not both.
    #
    # @option params [String] :filter_expression
    #   String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no
    #   filter expression is included, the request returns results for all
    #   game sessions in the fleet that are in `ACTIVE` status.
    #
    #   A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each
    #   condition consists of the following:
    #
    #   * **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are
    #     `gameSessionName`, `gameSessionId`, `gameSessionProperties`,
    #     `maximumSessions`, `creationTimeMillis`, `playerSessionCount`,
    #     `hasAvailablePlayerSessions`.
    #
    #   * **Comparator** -- Valid comparators are: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`,
    #     `>=`.
    #
    #   * **Value** -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers,
    #     boolean values (true/false) or strings depending on the operand.
    #     String values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in single
    #     quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string
    #     values can only be used with the comparators `=` and `<>`. For
    #     example, the following filter expression searches on
    #     `gameSessionName`\: "`FilterExpression": "gameSessionName =
    #     'Matt\'s Awesome Game 1'"`.
    #
    #   To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical
    #   keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` and parentheses as needed. For
    #   example: `x AND y AND NOT z`, `NOT (x OR y)`.
    #
    #   Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the
    #   following precedence rules:
    #
    #   1.  `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
    #
    #   2.  Parentheses
    #
    #   3.  NOT
    #
    #   4.  AND
    #
    #   5.  OR
    #
    #   For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at
    #   least ten players that have an open player slot: `"maximumSessions>=10
    #   AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true"`.
    #
    # @option params [String] :sort_expression
    #   Instructions on how to sort the search results. If no sort expression
    #   is included, the request returns results in random order. A sort
    #   expression consists of the following elements:
    #
    #   * **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are
    #     `gameSessionName`, `gameSessionId`, `gameSessionProperties`,
    #     `maximumSessions`, `creationTimeMillis`, `playerSessionCount`,
    #     `hasAvailablePlayerSessions`.
    #
    #   * **Order** -- Valid sort orders are `ASC` (ascending) and `DESC`
    #     (descending).
    #
    #   For example, this sort expression returns the oldest active sessions
    #   first: `"SortExpression": "creationTimeMillis ASC"`. Results with a
    #   null value for the sort operand are returned at the end of the list.
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :limit
    #   The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with
    #   `NextToken` to get results as a set of sequential pages. The maximum
    #   number of results returned is 20, even if this value is not set or is
    #   set higher than 20.
    #
    # @option params [String] :next_token
    #   Token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results.
    #   Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this operation.
    #   To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value.
    #

    # Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see
    # CreateGameSessionQueue). When processing a placement request, Amazon
    # GameLift searches for available resources on the queue's
    # destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement
    # request times out.
    #
    # A game session placement request can also request player sessions.
    # When a new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift
    # creates a player session for each player included in the request.
    #
    # When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each
    # fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration.
    # Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed in preference order.
    #
    # Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can
    # also provide latency data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency
    # data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected
    # to a fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder
    # the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region with
    # minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon
    # GameLift calculates each Region's average lag for all players and
    # reorders to get the best game play across all players.
    #
    # To place a new game session request, specify the following:
    #
    # * The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings
    #
    # * A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to
    #   track the status of the placement request
    #
    # * (Optional) A set of player data and a unique player ID for each
    #   player that you are joining to the new game session (player data is
    #   optional, but if you include it, you must also provide a unique ID
    #   for each player)
    #
    # * Latency data for all players (if you want to optimize game play for
    #   the players)
    #
    # If successful, a new game session placement is created.
    #
    # To track the status of a placement request, call
    # DescribeGameSessionPlacement and check the request's status. If the
    # status is `FULFILLED`, a new game session has been created and a game
    # session ARN and Region are referenced. If the placement request times

    # Finds new players to fill open slots in an existing game session. This
    # operation can be used to add players to matched games that start with
    # fewer than the maximum number of players or to replace players when
    # they drop out. By backfilling with the same matchmaker used to create
    # the original match, you ensure that new players meet the match
    # criteria and maintain a consistent experience throughout the game
    # session. You can backfill a match anytime after a game session has
    # been created.
    #
    # To request a match backfill, specify a unique ticket ID, the existing
    # game session's ARN, a matchmaking configuration, and a set of data
    # that describes all current players in the game session. If successful,
    # a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to
    # QUEUED. The ticket is placed in the matchmaker's ticket pool and
    # processed. Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed.
    #
    # The process of finding backfill matches is essentially identical to
    # the initial matchmaking process. The matchmaker searches the pool and
    # groups tickets together to form potential matches, allowing only one
    # backfill ticket per potential match. Once the a match is formed, the
    # matchmaker creates player sessions for the new players. All tickets in
    # the match are updated with the game session's connection information,
    # and the GameSession object is updated to include matchmaker data on
    # the new players. For more detail on how match backfill requests are
    # processed, see [ How Amazon GameLift FlexMatch Works][1].

    # Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on
    # custom matchmaking rules. If you're also using GameLift hosting, a
    # new game session is started for the matched players. Each matchmaking
    # request identifies one or more players to find a match for, and
    # specifies the type of match to build, including the team configuration
    # and the rules for an acceptable match. When a matchmaking request
    # identifies a group of players who want to play together, FlexMatch
    # finds additional players to fill the match. Match type, rules, and
    # other features are defined in a `MatchmakingConfiguration`.
    #
    # To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a
    # matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. For
    # each player, you must also include the player attribute values that
    # are required by the matchmaking configuration (in the rule set). If
    # successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to
    # `QUEUED`.
    #
    # Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed. If you're also
    # using GameLift hosting, a successfully completed ticket contains game
    # session connection information. Ticket status updates are tracked
    # using event notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service
    # (SNS), which is defined in the matchmaking configuration.

    # **This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and
    # game server groups.**
    #
    # Updates information about a registered game server to help GameLift
    # FleetIQ to track game server availability. This operation is called by
    # a game server process that is running on an instance in a game server
    # group.
    #
    # Use this operation to update the following types of game server
    # information. You can make all three types of updates in the same
    # request:
    #
    # * To update the game server's utilization status, identify the game
    #   server and game server group and specify the current utilization
    #   status. Use this status to identify when game servers are currently
    #   hosting games and when they are available to be claimed.
    #
    # * To report health status, identify the game server and game server
    #   group and set health check to `HEALTHY`. If a game server does not
    #   report health status for a certain length of time, the game server
    #   is no longer considered healthy. As a result, it will be eventually
    #   deregistered from the game server group to avoid affecting
    #   utilization metrics. The best practice is to report health every 60
    #   seconds.
    #
    # * To change game server metadata, provide updated game server data.
    #
    # Once a game server is successfully updated, the relevant statuses and
    # timestamps are updated.

    # @option params [String] :game_server_protection_policy
    #   A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are

    #   active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down
    #   event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected
    #   instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers
    #   running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion
    #   (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be

    #
    #   * `SPOT_ONLY` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group.
    #     If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting,
    #     the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot
    #     Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are
    #     started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated
    #     (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.
    #
    #   * `SPOT_PREFERRED` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever
    #     available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are
    #     unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting
    #     capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable
    #     Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are
    #     replaced with new On-Demand Instances.
    #
    #   * `ON_DEMAND_ONLY` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game
    #     server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while
    #     this balancing strategy is in force.
