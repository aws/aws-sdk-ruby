    # @!attribute [rw] auto_scaling_policy
    #   Configuration settings to define a scaling policy for the Auto

    #   uses the metric `"PercentUtilizedGameServers"` to maintain a buffer
    #   of idle game servers that can immediately accommodate new games and

    #   Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances
    #   and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options
    #   include the following:
    #
    #   * `SPOT_ONLY` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server
    #     group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game
    #     hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until
    #     Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are
    #     started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated
    #     (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.
    #
    #   * `SPOT_PREFERRED` - (default value) Spot Instances are used
    #     whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are
    #     unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting
    #     capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing
    #     nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay
    #     ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.
    #
    #   * `ON_DEMAND_ONLY` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game
    #     server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available,
    #     while this balancing strategy is in force.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] game_server_protection_policy
    #   A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are
    #   protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have
    #   active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down
    #   event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected
    #   instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers
    #   running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion
    #   (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be
    #   terminated by AWS regardless of protection status. This property is
    #   set to `NO_PROTECTION` by default.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] vpc_subnets
    #   A list of virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets to use with instances
    #   in the game server group. By default, all GameLift FleetIQ-supported
    #   Availability Zones are used. You can use this parameter to specify
    #   VPCs that you've set up. This property cannot be updated after the
    #   game server group is created, and the corresponding Auto Scaling

    #     `DOWNLOADING`. The compressed build has started downloading to a
    #     fleet instance for installation.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_BINARY\_DOWNLOAD\_FAILED -- The build failed to download to
    #     the fleet instance.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_CREATION\_EXTRACTING\_BUILD – The game server build was
    #     successfully downloaded to an instance, and the build files are
    #     now being extracted from the uploaded build and saved to an
    #     instance. Failure at this stage prevents a fleet from moving to
    #     `ACTIVE` status. Logs for this stage display a list of the files
    #     that are extracted and saved on the instance. Access the logs by
    #     using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl*.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_CREATION\_RUNNING\_INSTALLER – The game server build files
    #     were successfully extracted, and the GameLift is now running the
    #     build's install script (if one is included). Failure in this
    #     stage prevents a fleet from moving to `ACTIVE` status. Logs for
    #     this stage list the installation steps and whether or not the
    #     install completed successfully. Access the logs by using the URL
    #     in *PreSignedLogUrl*.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_CREATION\_VALIDATING\_RUNTIME\_CONFIG -- The build process
    #     was successful, and the GameLift is now verifying that the game
    #     server launch paths, which are specified in the fleet's runtime
    #     configuration, exist. If any listed launch path exists, GameLift
    #     tries to launch a game server process and waits for the process to
    #     report ready. Failures in this stage prevent a fleet from moving
    #     to `ACTIVE` status. Logs for this stage list the launch paths in
    #     the runtime configuration and indicate whether each is found.
    #     Access the logs by using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl*.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_STATE\_VALIDATING -- Fleet status changed from
    #     `DOWNLOADING` to `VALIDATING`.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_VALIDATION\_LAUNCH\_PATH\_NOT\_FOUND -- Validation of the
    #     runtime configuration failed because the executable specified in a
    #     launch path does not exist on the instance.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_STATE\_BUILDING -- Fleet status changed from `VALIDATING`
    #     to `BUILDING`.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_VALIDATION\_EXECUTABLE\_RUNTIME\_FAILURE -- Validation of
    #     the runtime configuration failed because the executable specified
    #     in a launch path failed to run on the fleet instance.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_STATE\_ACTIVATING -- Fleet status changed from `BUILDING`
    #     to `ACTIVATING`.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_ACTIVATION\_FAILED - The fleet failed to successfully
    #     complete one of the steps in the fleet activation process. This
    #     event code indicates that the game build was successfully
    #     downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated, but was not
    #     able to start a server process. Learn more at [ Debug Fleet
    #     Creation Issues][1]
    #
    #   * FLEET\_STATE\_ACTIVE -- The fleet's status changed from
    #     `ACTIVATING` to `ACTIVE`. The fleet is now ready to host game
    #     sessions.
    #
    #   **VPC peering events:**
    #
    #   * FLEET\_VPC\_PEERING\_SUCCEEDED -- A VPC peering connection has
    #     been established between the VPC for an GameLift fleet and a VPC
    #     in your AWS account.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_VPC\_PEERING\_FAILED -- A requested VPC peering connection
    #     has failed. Event details and status information (see
    #     DescribeVpcPeeringConnections) provide additional detail. A common
    #     reason for peering failure is that the two VPCs have overlapping
    #     CIDR blocks of IPv4 addresses. To resolve this, change the CIDR
    #     block for the VPC in your AWS account. For more information on VPC
    #     peering failures, see
    #     [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html][2]
    #
    #   * FLEET\_VPC\_PEERING\_DELETED -- A VPC peering connection has been
    #     successfully deleted.
    #
    #   **Spot instance events:**
    #
    #   * INSTANCE\_INTERRUPTED -- A spot instance was interrupted by EC2
    #     with a two-minute notification.
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   **Other fleet events:**
    #
    #   * FLEET\_SCALING\_EVENT -- A change was made to the fleet's
    #     capacity settings (desired instances, minimum/maximum scaling
    #     limits). Event messaging includes the new capacity settings.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_NEW\_GAME\_SESSION\_PROTECTION\_POLICY\_UPDATED -- A change
    #     was made to the fleet's game session protection policy setting.
    #     Event messaging includes both the old and new policy setting.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_DELETED -- A request to delete a fleet was initiated.
    #
    #   * GENERIC\_EVENT -- An unspecified event has occurred.

    # * Rules -- Optional. Rules define how to evaluate potential players
    #   for a match based on player attributes. A rule might specify minimum
    #   requirements for individual players, teams, or entire matches. For
    #   example, a rule might require each player to meet a certain skill
    #   level, each team to have at least one player in a certain role, or
    #   the match to have a minimum average skill level. or may describe an
    #   entire group--such as all teams must be evenly matched or have at
    #   least one player in a certain role.
    #
    # * Expansions -- Optional. Expansions allow you to relax the rules
    #   after a period of time when no acceptable matches are found. This
    #   feature lets you balance getting players into games in a reasonable
    #   amount of time instead of making them wait indefinitely for the best
    #   possible match. For example, you might use an expansion to increase
    #   the maximum skill variance between players after 30 seconds.

    #   String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no
    #   filter expression is included, the request returns results for all
    #   game sessions in the fleet that are in `ACTIVE` status.
    #
    #   A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each
    #   condition consists of the following:
    #
    #   * **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are
    #     `gameSessionName`, `gameSessionId`, `gameSessionProperties`,
    #     `maximumSessions`, `creationTimeMillis`, `playerSessionCount`,
    #     `hasAvailablePlayerSessions`.
    #
    #   * **Comparator** -- Valid comparators are: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`,
    #     `<=`, `>=`.
    #
    #   * **Value** -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers,
    #     boolean values (true/false) or strings depending on the operand.
    #     String values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in single
    #     quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string
    #     values can only be used with the comparators `=` and `<>`. For
    #     example, the following filter expression searches on
    #     `gameSessionName`\: "`FilterExpression": "gameSessionName =
    #     'Matt\'s Awesome Game 1'"`.
    #
    #   To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical
    #   keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` and parentheses as needed. For
    #   example: `x AND y AND NOT z`, `NOT (x OR y)`.
    #
    #   Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the
    #   following precedence rules:
    #
    #   1.  `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
    #
    #   2.  Parentheses
    #
    #   3.  NOT
    #
    #   4.  AND
    #
    #   5.  OR
    #
    #   For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting
    #   at least ten players that have an open player slot:
    #   `"maximumSessions>=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true"`.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] sort_expression
    #   Instructions on how to sort the search results. If no sort
    #   expression is included, the request returns results in random order.
    #   A sort expression consists of the following elements:
    #
    #   * **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are
    #     `gameSessionName`, `gameSessionId`, `gameSessionProperties`,
    #     `maximumSessions`, `creationTimeMillis`, `playerSessionCount`,
    #     `hasAvailablePlayerSessions`.
    #
    #   * **Order** -- Valid sort orders are `ASC` (ascending) and `DESC`
    #     (descending).
    #
    #   For example, this sort expression returns the oldest active sessions
    #   first: `"SortExpression": "creationTimeMillis ASC"`. Results with a
    #   null value for the sort operand are returned at the end of the list.
    #   @return [String]

    #     group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game
    #     hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until
    #     Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are
    #     started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated
    #     (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.
    #
    #   * `SPOT_PREFERRED` - (default value) Spot Instances are used
    #     whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are
    #     unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting
    #     capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing
    #     nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay
    #     ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.
    #
    #   * `ON_DEMAND_ONLY` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game
    #     server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available,
    #     while this balancing strategy is in force.
