    #     group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game
    #     hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until
    #     Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are
    #     started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated
    #     (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.

    #   * `SPOT_PREFERRED` - (default value) Spot Instances are used
    #     whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are
    #     unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting
    #     capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing
    #     nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay
    #     ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.

    #
    #   * FLEET\_STATE\_DOWNLOADING -- Fleet status changed from `NEW` to
    #     `DOWNLOADING`. The compressed build has started downloading to a
    #     fleet instance for installation.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_STATE\_VALIDATING -- Fleet status changed from
    #     `DOWNLOADING` to `VALIDATING`. Amazon GameLift has successfully
    #     downloaded the build and is now validating the build files.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_STATE\_BUILDING -- Fleet status changed from `VALIDATING`
    #     to `BUILDING`. Amazon GameLift has successfully verified the build
    #     files and is now running the installation scripts.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_STATE\_ACTIVATING -- Fleet status changed from `BUILDING`
    #     to `ACTIVATING`. Amazon GameLift is trying to launch an instance
    #     and test the connectivity between the build and the Amazon
    #     GameLift Service via the Server SDK.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_STATE\_ACTIVE -- The fleet's status changed from
    #     `ACTIVATING` to `ACTIVE`. The fleet is now ready to host game
    #     sessions.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_STATE\_ERROR -- The Fleet's status changed to `ERROR`.
    #     Describe the fleet event message for more details.
    #
    #   **Fleet creation events (ordered by fleet creation activity):**
    #
    #   * FLEET\_BINARY\_DOWNLOAD\_FAILED -- The build failed to download to
    #     the fleet instance.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_CREATION\_EXTRACTING\_BUILD -- The game server build was
    #     successfully downloaded to an instance, and the build files are
    #     now being extracted from the uploaded build and saved to an
    #     instance. Failure at this stage prevents a fleet from moving to
    #     ACTIVE status. Logs for this stage display a list of the files
    #     that are extracted and saved on the instance. Access the logs by
    #     using the URL in *PreSignedLogUrl*.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_CREATION\_RUNNING\_INSTALLER -- The game server build files
    #     were successfully extracted, and the GameLift is now running the
    #     build's install script (if one is included). Failure in this
    #     stage prevents a fleet from moving to ACTIVE status. Logs for this
    #     stage list the installation steps and whether or not the install
    #     completed successfully. Access the logs by using the URL in
    #     *PreSignedLogUrl*.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_CREATION\_VALIDATING\_RUNTIME\_CONFIG -- The build process
    #     was successful, and the GameLift is now verifying that the game
    #     server launch paths, which are specified in the fleet's runtime
    #     configuration, exist. If any listed launch path exists, Amazon
    #     GameLift tries to launch a game server process and waits for the
    #     process to report ready. Failures in this stage prevent a fleet
    #     from moving to `ACTIVE` status. Logs for this stage list the
    #     launch paths in the runtime configuration and indicate whether
    #     each is found. Access the logs by using the URL in
    #     *PreSignedLogUrl*.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_VALIDATION\_LAUNCH\_PATH\_NOT\_FOUND -- Validation of the
    #     runtime configuration failed because the executable specified in a
    #     launch path does not exist on the instance.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_VALIDATION\_EXECUTABLE\_RUNTIME\_FAILURE -- Validation of
    #     the runtime configuration failed because the executable specified
    #     in a launch path failed to run on the fleet instance.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_VALIDATION\_TIMED\_OUT -- Validation of the fleet at the
    #     end of creation timed out. Try fleet creation again.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_ACTIVATION\_FAILED -- The fleet failed to successfully
    #     complete one of the steps in the fleet activation process. This
    #     event code indicates that the game build was successfully
    #     downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated, but was not
    #     able to start a server process. For more information, see [Debug
    #     Fleet Creation Issues][1].
    #
    #   * FLEET\_ACTIVATION\_FAILED\_NO\_INSTANCES -- Fleet creation was not
    #     able to obtain any instances based on the input fleet attributes.
    #     Try again at a different time or choose a different combination of
    #     fleet attributes such as fleet type, instance type, etc.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_INITIALIZATION\_FAILED -- A generic exception occurred
    #     during fleet creation. Describe the fleet event message for more
    #     details.
    #
    #   **VPC peering events:**
    #
    #   * FLEET\_VPC\_PEERING\_SUCCEEDED -- A VPC peering connection has
    #     been established between the VPC for an Amazon GameLift fleet and
    #     a VPC in your Amazon Web Services account.
    #
    #   * FLEET\_VPC\_PEERING\_FAILED -- A requested VPC peering connection
    #     has failed. Event details and status information provide
    #     additional detail. A common reason for peering failure is that the
    #     two VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks of IPv4 addresses. To
    #     resolve this, change the CIDR block for the VPC in your Amazon Web
    #     Services account. For more information on VPC peering failures,
    #     see
    #     [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html][2]
    #
    #   * FLEET\_VPC\_PEERING\_DELETED -- A VPC peering connection has been
    #     successfully deleted.
    #
    #   **Spot instance events:**
    #
    #   * INSTANCE\_INTERRUPTED -- A spot instance was interrupted by EC2
    #     with a two-minute notification.
    #
    #   * INSTANCE\_RECYCLED -- A spot instance was determined to have a
    #     high risk of interruption and is scheduled to be recycled once it
    #     has no active game sessions.
    #
    #   **Server process events:**
    #
    #   * SERVER\_PROCESS\_INVALID\_PATH -- The game server executable or
    #     script could not be found based on the Fleet runtime
    #     configuration. Check that the launch path is correct based on the
    #     operating system of the Fleet.
    #
    #   * SERVER\_PROCESS\_SDK\_INITIALIZATION\_TIMEOUT -- The server
    #     process did not call `InitSDK()` within the time expected (5
    #     minutes). Check your game session log to see why `InitSDK()` was
    #     not called in time.
    #
    #   * SERVER\_PROCESS\_PROCESS\_READY\_TIMEOUT -- The server process did
    #     not call `ProcessReady()` within the time expected (5 minutes)
    #     after calling `InitSDK()`. Check your game session log to see why
    #     `ProcessReady()` was not called in time.
    #
    #   * SERVER\_PROCESS\_CRASHED -- The server process exited without
    #     calling `ProcessEnding()`. Check your game session log to see why
    #     `ProcessEnding()` was not called.
    #
    #   * SERVER\_PROCESS\_TERMINATED\_UNHEALTHY -- The server process did
    #     not report a valid health check for too long and was therefore
    #     terminated by GameLift. Check your game session log to see if the
    #     thread became stuck processing a synchronous task for too long.
    #
    #   * SERVER\_PROCESS\_FORCE\_TERMINATED -- The server process did not
    #     exit cleanly within the time expected after `OnProcessTerminate()`
    #     was sent. Check your game session log to see why termination took
    #     longer than expected.
    #
    #   * SERVER\_PROCESS\_PROCESS\_EXIT\_TIMEOUT -- The server process did
    #     not exit cleanly within the time expected (30 seconds) after
    #     calling `ProcessEnding()`. Check your game session log to see why
    #     termination took longer than expected.

    #   ID, but not both.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] location
    #   A fleet location to search for game sessions. You can specify a
    #   fleet's home Region or a remote location. Use the Amazon Web
    #   Services Region code format, such as `us-west-2`.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] filter_expression
    #   String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no
    #   filter expression is included, the request returns results for all
    #   game sessions in the fleet that are in `ACTIVE` status.
    #
    #   A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each
    #   condition consists of the following:
    #
    #   * **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are
    #     `gameSessionName`, `gameSessionId`, `gameSessionProperties`,
    #     `maximumSessions`, `creationTimeMillis`, `playerSessionCount`,
    #     `hasAvailablePlayerSessions`.
    #
    #   * **Comparator** -- Valid comparators are: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`,
    #     `<=`, `>=`.
    #
    #   * **Value** -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers,
    #     boolean values (true/false) or strings depending on the operand.
    #     String values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in single
    #     quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string
    #     values can only be used with the comparators `=` and `<>`. For
    #     example, the following filter expression searches on
    #     `gameSessionName`: "`FilterExpression": "gameSessionName =
    #     'Matt\'s Awesome Game 1'"`.
    #
    #   To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical
    #   keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` and parentheses as needed. For
    #   example: `x AND y AND NOT z`, `NOT (x OR y)`.
    #
    #   Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the
    #   following precedence rules:
    #
    #   1.  `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
    #
    #   2.  Parentheses
    #
    #   3.  NOT
    #
    #   4.  AND
    #
    #   5.  OR
    #
    #   For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting
    #   at least ten players that have an open player slot:
    #   `"maximumSessions>=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true"`.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] sort_expression
    #   Instructions on how to sort the search results. If no sort
    #   expression is included, the request returns results in random order.
    #   A sort expression consists of the following elements:
    #
    #   * **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are
    #     `gameSessionName`, `gameSessionId`, `gameSessionProperties`,
    #     `maximumSessions`, `creationTimeMillis`, `playerSessionCount`,
    #     `hasAvailablePlayerSessions`.
    #
    #   * **Order** -- Valid sort orders are `ASC` (ascending) and `DESC`
    #     (descending).
    #
    #   For example, this sort expression returns the oldest active sessions
    #   first: `"SortExpression": "creationTimeMillis ASC"`. Results with a
    #   null value for the sort operand are returned at the end of the list.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] limit
    #   The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with
    #   `NextToken` to get results as a set of sequential pages. The maximum
    #   number of results returned is 20, even if this value is not set or

    #     whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are
    #     unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting
    #     capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing
