# This module provides support for Amazon GameLift. This module is available in the
# `aws-sdk-gamelift` gem.
#
# # Client
#
# The {Client} class provides one method for each API operation. Operation
# methods each accept a hash of request parameters and return a response
# structure.
#
#     game_lift = Aws::GameLift::Client.new
#     resp = game_lift.accept_match(params)
#
# See {Client} for more information.
#
# # Errors
#
# Errors returned from Amazon GameLift are defined in the
# {Errors} module and all extend {Errors::ServiceError}.
#
#     begin
#       # do stuff
#     rescue Aws::GameLift::Errors::ServiceError
