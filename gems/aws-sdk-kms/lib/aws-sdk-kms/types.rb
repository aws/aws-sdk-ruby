    #   when the encryption context in the request matches
    #   (`EncryptionContextEquals`) or includes (`EncryptionContextSubset`)
    #   the encryption context specified in this structure. For more

    # @!attribute [rw] policy
    #   The key policy to attach to the CMK.
    #
    #   If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:
    #
    #   * If you don't set `BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck` to true, the
    #     key policy must allow the principal that is making the `CreateKey`
    #     request to make a subsequent PutKeyPolicy request on the CMK. This
    #     reduces the risk that the CMK becomes unmanageable. For more
    #     information, refer to the scenario in the [Default Key Policy][1]
    #     section of the <i> <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer
    #     Guide</i> </i>.
    #
    #   * Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more
    #     principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be
    #     visible to AWS KMS. When you create a new AWS principal (for
    #     example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a delay
    #     before including the new principal in a key policy because the new
    #     principal might not be immediately visible to AWS KMS. For more
    #     information, see [Changes that I make are not always immediately
    #     visible][2] in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User
    #     Guide*.
    #
    #   If you do not provide a key policy, AWS KMS attaches a default key
    #   policy to the CMK. For more information, see [Default Key Policy][3]
    #   in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   The key policy size quota is 32 kilobytes (32768 bytes).

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] customer_master_key_spec
    #   Specifies the type of CMK to create. The default value,
    #   `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, creates a CMK with a 256-bit symmetric key for
    #   encryption and decryption. For help choosing a key spec for your
    #   CMK, see [How to Choose Your CMK Configuration][1] in the *AWS Key
    #   Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   The `CustomerMasterKeySpec` determines whether the CMK contains a
    #   symmetric key or an asymmetric key pair. It also determines the
    #   encryption algorithms or signing algorithms that the CMK supports.
    #   You can't change the `CustomerMasterKeySpec` after the CMK is
    #   created. To further restrict the algorithms that can be used with
    #   the CMK, use a condition key in its key policy or IAM policy. For
    #   more information, see [kms:EncryptionAlgorithm][2] or [kms:Signing
    #   Algorithm][3] in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   [AWS services that are integrated with AWS KMS][4] use symmetric
    #   CMKs to protect your data. These services do not support asymmetric
    #   CMKs. For help determining whether a CMK is symmetric or asymmetric,
    #   see [Identifying Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs][5] in the *AWS Key
    #   Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   AWS KMS supports the following key specs for CMKs:
    #
    #   * Symmetric key (default)
    #
    #     * `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT` (AES-256-GCM)
    #
    #     ^
    #
    #   * Asymmetric RSA key pairs
    #
    #     * `RSA_2048`
    #
    #     * `RSA_3072`
    #
    #     * `RSA_4096`
    #
    #   * Asymmetric NIST-recommended elliptic curve key pairs
    #
    #     * `ECC_NIST_P256` (secp256r1)
    #
    #     * `ECC_NIST_P384` (secp384r1)
    #
    #     * `ECC_NIST_P521` (secp521r1)
    #
    #   * Other asymmetric elliptic curve key pairs
    #
    #     * `ECC_SECG_P256K1` (secp256k1), commonly used for
    #       cryptocurrencies.

    #   Creates the CMK in the specified [custom key store][1] and the key
    #   material in its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. To create a CMK in
    #   a custom key store, you must also specify the `Origin` parameter
    #   with a value of `AWS_CLOUDHSM`. The AWS CloudHSM cluster that is
    #   associated with the custom key store must have at least two active
    #   HSMs, each in a different Availability Zone in the Region.
    #
    #   This parameter is valid only for symmetric CMKs and regional CMKs.
    #   You cannot create an asymmetric CMK or a multi-Region CMK in a

    # @!attribute [rw] tags
    #   Assigns one or more tags to the CMK. Use this parameter to tag the

    #   operation.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Tagging or untagging a CMK can allow or deny permission to the CMK.
    #   For details, see [Using ABAC in AWS KMS][1] in the *AWS Key
    #   Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   To use this parameter, you must have [kms:TagResource][2] permission
    #   in an IAM policy.
    #
    #   Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and
    #   the tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null)
    #   string. You cannot have more than one tag on a CMK with the same tag
    #   key. If you specify an existing tag key with a different tag value,
    #   AWS KMS replaces the current tag value with the specified one.
    #
    #   When you assign tags to an AWS resource, AWS generates a cost
    #   allocation report with usage and costs aggregated by tags. Tags can
    #   also be used to control access to a CMK. For details, see [Tagging

    #
    #   For a multi-Region key, set this parameter to `True`. For a
    #   single-Region CMK, omit this parameter or set it to `False`. The
    #   default value is `False`.
    #
    #   This operation supports *multi-Region keys*, an AWS KMS feature that
    #   lets you create multiple interoperable CMKs in different AWS
    #   Regions. Because these CMKs have the same key ID, key material, and
    #   other metadata, you can use them to encrypt data in one AWS Region
    #   and decrypt it in a different AWS Region without making a
    #   cross-Region call or exposing the plaintext data. For more
    #   information about multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region
    #   keys][1] in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   This value creates a *primary key*, not a replica. To create a

    #
    #   You can create a symmetric or asymmetric multi-Region CMK, and you

    # @!attribute [rw] connection_error_code
    #   Describes the connection error. This field appears in the response
    #   only when the `ConnectionState` is `FAILED`. For help resolving
    #   these errors, see [How to Fix a Connection Failure][1] in *AWS Key
    #   Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   Valid values are:
    #
    #   * `CLUSTER_NOT_FOUND` - AWS KMS cannot find the AWS CloudHSM cluster
    #     with the specified cluster ID.
    #
    #   * `INSUFFICIENT_CLOUDHSM_HSMS` - The associated AWS CloudHSM cluster
    #     does not contain any active HSMs. To connect a custom key store to
    #     its AWS CloudHSM cluster, the cluster must contain at least one
    #     active HSM.
    #
    #   * `INTERNAL_ERROR` - AWS KMS could not complete the request due to
    #     an internal error. Retry the request. For `ConnectCustomKeyStore`
    #     requests, disconnect the custom key store before trying to connect
    #     again.
    #
    #   * `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` - AWS KMS does not have the correct password
    #     for the `kmsuser` crypto user in the AWS CloudHSM cluster. Before
    #     you can connect your custom key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster,
    #     you must change the `kmsuser` account password and update the key
    #     store password value for the custom key store.
    #
    #   * `NETWORK_ERRORS` - Network errors are preventing AWS KMS from
    #     connecting to the custom key store.
    #
    #   * `SUBNET_NOT_FOUND` - A subnet in the AWS CloudHSM cluster
    #     configuration was deleted. If AWS KMS cannot find all of the
    #     subnets in the cluster configuration, attempts to connect the
    #     custom key store to the AWS CloudHSM cluster fail. To fix this
    #     error, create a cluster from a recent backup and associate it with
    #     your custom key store. (This process creates a new cluster
    #     configuration with a VPC and private subnets.) For details, see
    #     [How to Fix a Connection Failure][1] in the *AWS Key Management
    #     Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   * `USER_LOCKED_OUT` - The `kmsuser` CU account is locked out of the
    #     associated AWS CloudHSM cluster due to too many failed password
    #     attempts. Before you can connect your custom key store to its AWS
    #     CloudHSM cluster, you must change the `kmsuser` account password
    #     and update the key store password value for the custom key store.
    #
    #   * `USER_LOGGED_IN` - The `kmsuser` CU account is logged into the the
    #     associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. This prevents AWS KMS from
    #     rotating the `kmsuser` account password and logging into the
    #     cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its AWS
    #     CloudHSM cluster, you must log the `kmsuser` CU out of the
    #     cluster. If you changed the `kmsuser` password to log into the
    #     cluster, you must also and update the key store password value for
    #     the custom key store. For help, see [How to Log Out and
    #     Reconnect][2] in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   * `USER_NOT_FOUND` - AWS KMS cannot find a `kmsuser` CU account in
    #     the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. Before you can connect your
    #     custom key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, you must create a
    #     `kmsuser` CU account in the cluster, and then update the key store
    #     password value for the custom key store.

    #   that AWS KMS uses do not support an encryption context.
    #
    #   An *encryption context* is a collection of non-secret key-value
    #   pairs that represents additional authenticated data. When you use an
    #   encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an
    #   exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data.
    #   An encryption context is optional when encrypting with a symmetric
    #   CMK, but it is highly recommended.

    #   Specifies the customer master key (CMK) that AWS KMS uses to decrypt
    #   the ciphertext. Enter a key ID of the CMK that was used to encrypt
    #   the ciphertext.
    #
    #   This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted
    #   under an asymmetric CMK. If you used a symmetric CMK, AWS KMS can
    #   get the CMK from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext
    #   blob. However, it is always recommended as a best practice. This
    #   practice ensures that you use the CMK that you intend.
    #
    #   To specify a CMK, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN.
    #   When using an alias name, prefix it with `"alias/"`. To specify a
    #   CMK in a different AWS account, you must use the key ARN or alias
    #   ARN.
    #
    #   For example:
    #
    #   * Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Key ARN:

    #
    #   * Alias ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`
    #

    #   fails.
    #
    #   This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted

    # Use this structure to allow [cryptographic operations][1] in the grant
    # only when the operation request includes the specified [encryption
    # context][2].
    #
    # AWS KMS applies the grant constraints only to cryptographic operations
    # that support an encryption context, that is, all cryptographic
    # operations with a [symmetric CMK][3]. Grant constraints are not
    # applied to operations that do not support an encryption context, such
    # as cryptographic operations with asymmetric CMKs and management
    # operations, such as DescribeKey or RetireGrant.
    #
    # In a cryptographic operation, the encryption context in the decryption
    # operation must be an exact, case-sensitive match for the keys and
    # values in the encryption context of the encryption operation. Only the
    # order of the pairs can vary.
    #
    #  However, in a grant constraint, the key in each key-value pair is not
    # case sensitive, but the value is case sensitive.
    #
    #  To avoid confusion, do not use multiple encryption context pairs that
    # differ only by case. To require a fully case-sensitive encryption
    # context, use the `kms:EncryptionContext:` and
    # `kms:EncryptionContextKeys` conditions in an IAM or key policy. For
    # details, see [kms:EncryptionContext:][4] in the <i> <i>AWS Key
    # Management Service Developer Guide</i> </i>.

    # @!attribute [rw] policy
    #   The key policy to attach to the CMK. This parameter is optional. If
    #   you do not provide a key policy, AWS KMS attaches the [default key
    #   policy][1] to the CMK.
    #
    #   The key policy is not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You
    #   can specify the same key policy or a different key policy for each
    #   key in a set of related multi-Region keys. AWS KMS does not
    #   synchronize this property.
    #
    #   If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:
    #
    #   * If you don't set `BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck` to true, the
    #     key policy must give the caller `kms:PutKeyPolicy` permission on
    #     the replica CMK. This reduces the risk that the CMK becomes
    #     unmanageable. For more information, refer to the scenario in the
    #     [Default Key Policy][2] section of the <i> <i>AWS Key Management
    #     Service Developer Guide</i> </i>.
    #
    #   * Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more
    #     principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be
    #     visible to AWS KMS. When you create a new AWS principal (for
    #     example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a delay
    #     before including the new principal in a key policy because the new
    #     principal might not be immediately visible to AWS KMS. For more
    #     information, see [Changes that I make are not always immediately
    #     visible][3] in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User
    #     Guide*.

    #   empty string (no description).
    #
    #   The description is not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You
    #   can specify the same description or a different description for each
    #   key in a set of related multi-Region keys. AWS KMS does not
    #   synchronize this property.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] tags
    #   Assigns one or more tags to the replica key. Use this parameter to
    #   tag the CMK when it is created. To tag an existing CMK, use the
    #   TagResource operation.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Tagging or untagging a CMK can allow or deny permission to the CMK.
    #   For details, see [Using ABAC in AWS KMS][1] in the *AWS Key
    #   Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   To use this parameter, you must have [kms:TagResource][2] permission
    #   in an IAM policy.
    #
    #   Tags are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can specify
    #   the same tags or different tags for each key in a set of related
    #   multi-Region keys. AWS KMS does not synchronize this property.
    #
    #   Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and
    #   the tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null)
    #   string. You cannot have more than one tag on a CMK with the same tag
    #   key. If you specify an existing tag key with a different tag value,
    #   AWS KMS replaces the current tag value with the specified one.
    #
    #   When you assign tags to an AWS resource, AWS generates a cost
    #   allocation report with usage and costs aggregated by tags. Tags can
    #   also be used to control access to a CMK. For details, see [Tagging
    #   Keys][3].
