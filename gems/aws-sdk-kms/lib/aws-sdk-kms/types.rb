    #
    #   For external key stores with `PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` connectivity, this

    #   stores with a `CustomKeyStoreType` of `EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE`.
    #
    #   The `XksProxyAuthenticationCredential` has two required elements:
    #   `RawSecretAccessKey`, a secret key, and `AccessKeyId`, a unique
    #   identifier for the `RawSecretAccessKey`. For character requirements,
    #   see

    #   external key store proxy on your behalf. This credential is
    #   unrelated to Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon Web
    #   Services credentials.
    #
    #   This parameter doesn't set or change the authentication credentials
    #   on the XKS proxy. It just tells KMS the credential that you
    #   established on your external key store proxy. If you rotate your
    #   proxy authentication credential, use the UpdateCustomKeyStore
    #   operation to provide the new credential to KMS.
    #   @return [Types::XksProxyAuthenticationCredentialType]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] xks_proxy_connectivity
    #   Indicates how KMS communicates with the external key store proxy.
    #   This parameter is required for custom key stores with a
    #   `CustomKeyStoreType` of `EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE`.
    #
    #   If the external key store proxy uses a public endpoint, specify
    #   `PUBLIC_ENDPOINT`. If the external key store proxy uses a Amazon VPC
    #   endpoint service for communication with KMS, specify
    #   `VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE`. For help making this choice, see [Choosing a
    #   connectivity option][1] in the *Key Management Service Developer
    #   Guide*.
    #
    #   An Amazon VPC endpoint service keeps your communication with KMS in
    #   a private address space entirely within Amazon Web Services, but it
    #   requires more configuration, including establishing a Amazon VPC
    #   with multiple subnets, a VPC endpoint service, a network load
    #   balancer, and a verified private DNS name. A public endpoint is
    #   simpler to set up, but it might be slower and might not fulfill your
    #   security requirements. You might consider testing with a public
    #   endpoint, and then establishing a VPC endpoint service for
    #   production tasks. Note that this choice does not determine the
    #   location of the external key store proxy. Even if you choose a VPC
    #   endpoint service, the proxy can be hosted within the VPC or outside
    #   of Amazon Web Services such as in your corporate data center.

    #   other output.
    #
    #   KMS supports the `EncryptionContextEquals` and
    #   `EncryptionContextSubset` grant constraints, which allow the
    #   permissions in the grant only when the encryption context in the
    #   request matches (`EncryptionContextEquals`) or includes
    #   (`EncryptionContextSubset`) the encryption context specified in the
    #   constraint.
    #
    #   The encryption context grant constraints are supported only on
    #   [grant operations][1] that include an `EncryptionContext` parameter,
    #   such as cryptographic operations on symmetric encryption KMS keys.
    #   Grants with grant constraints can include the DescribeKey and
    #   RetireGrant operations, but the constraint doesn't apply to these
    #   operations. If a grant with a grant constraint includes the
    #   `CreateGrant` operation, the constraint requires that any grants
    #   created with the `CreateGrant` permission have an equally strict or
    #   stricter encryption context constraint.
    #
    #   You cannot use an encryption context grant constraint for
    #   cryptographic operations with asymmetric KMS keys or HMAC KMS keys.
    #   Operations with these keys don't support an encryption context.
    #
    #   Each constraint value can include up to 8 encryption context pairs.
    #   The encryption context value in each constraint cannot exceed 384
    #   characters. For information about grant constraints, see [Using
    #   grant constraints][2] in the *Key Management Service Developer

    #   The key policy to attach to the KMS key.
    #
    #   If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:
    #
    #   * The key policy must allow the calling principal to make a
    #     subsequent `PutKeyPolicy` request on the KMS key. This reduces the
    #     risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For more information,
    #     see [Default key policy][1] in the *Key Management Service
    #     Developer Guide*. (To omit this condition, set
    #     `BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck` to true.)
    #
    #   * Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more
    #     principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be
    #     visible to KMS. When you create a new Amazon Web Services
    #     principal, you might need to enforce a delay before including the
    #     new principal in a key policy because the new principal might not
    #     be immediately visible to KMS. For more information, see [Changes
    #     that I make are not always immediately visible][2] in the *Amazon
    #     Web Services Identity and Access Management User Guide*.
    #
    #   If you do not provide a key policy, KMS attaches a default key
    #   policy to the KMS key. For more information, see [Default key
    #   policy][3] in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   The key policy size quota is 32 kilobytes (32768 bytes).

    #
    #   * For symmetric encryption KMS keys, omit the parameter or specify

    #   parameter in your code. However, to avoid breaking changes, KMS
    #   supports both parameters.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] key_spec
    #   Specifies the type of KMS key to create. The default value,
    #   `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, creates a KMS key with a 256-bit AES-GCM key
    #   that is used for encryption and decryption, except in China Regions,
    #   where it creates a 128-bit symmetric key that uses SM4 encryption.
    #   For help choosing a key spec for your KMS key, see [Choosing a KMS
    #   key type][1] in the <i> <i>Key Management Service Developer
    #   Guide</i> </i>.
    #
    #   The `KeySpec` determines whether the KMS key contains a symmetric
    #   key or an asymmetric key pair. It also determines the algorithms
    #   that the KMS key supports. You can't change the `KeySpec` after the
    #   KMS key is created. To further restrict the algorithms that can be
    #   used with the KMS key, use a condition key in its key policy or IAM
    #   policy. For more information, see [kms:EncryptionAlgorithm][2],
    #   [kms:MacAlgorithm][3] or [kms:Signing Algorithm][4] in the <i>
    #   <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i> </i>.

    #   [Amazon Web Services services that are integrated with KMS][5] use
    #   symmetric encryption KMS keys to protect your data. These services
    #   do not support asymmetric KMS keys or HMAC KMS keys.

    # @!attribute [rw] multi_region
    #   Creates a multi-Region primary key that you can replicate into other
    #   Amazon Web Services Regions. You cannot change this value after you
    #   create the KMS key.
    #
    #   For a multi-Region key, set this parameter to `True`. For a
    #   single-Region KMS key, omit this parameter or set it to `False`. The
    #   default value is `False`.
    #
    #   This operation supports *multi-Region keys*, an KMS feature that
    #   lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon
    #   Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID,
    #   key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably
    #   to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in
    #   a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the
    #   data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about
    #   multi-Region keys, see [Multi-Region keys in KMS][1] in the *Key
    #   Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   This value creates a *primary key*, not a replica. To create a
    #   *replica key*, use the ReplicateKey operation.
    #
    #   You can create a symmetric or asymmetric multi-Region key, and you
    #   can create a multi-Region key with imported key material. However,
    #   you cannot create a multi-Region key in a custom key store.

    # @!attribute [rw] xks_key_id
    #   Identifies the [external key][1] that serves as key material for the
    #   KMS key in an [external key store][2]. Specify the ID that the
    #   [external key store proxy][3] uses to refer to the external key. For
    #   help, see the documentation for your external key store proxy.
    #
    #   This parameter is required for a KMS key with an `Origin` value of
    #   `EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE`. It is not valid for KMS keys with any other
    #   `Origin` value.
    #
    #   The external key must be an existing 256-bit AES symmetric
    #   encryption key hosted outside of Amazon Web Services in an external
    #   key manager associated with the external key store specified by the
    #   `CustomKeyStoreId` parameter. This key must be enabled and
    #   configured to perform encryption and decryption. Each KMS key in an
    #   external key store must use a different external key. For details,
    #   see [Requirements for a KMS key in an external key store][4] in the
    #   *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   Each KMS key in an external key store is associated two backing
    #   keys. One is key material that KMS generates. The other is the
    #   external key specified by this parameter. When you use the KMS key
    #   in an external key store to encrypt data, the encryption operation
    #   is performed first by KMS using the KMS key material, and then by
    #   the external key manager using the specified external key, a process
    #   known as *double encryption*. For details, see [Double
    #   encryption][5] in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

    #
    #   **All custom key stores:**
    #
    #   * `INTERNAL_ERROR` — KMS could not complete the request due to an
    #     internal error. Retry the request. For `ConnectCustomKeyStore`
    #     requests, disconnect the custom key store before trying to connect
    #     again.
    #
    #   * `NETWORK_ERRORS` — Network errors are preventing KMS from
    #     connecting the custom key store to its backing key store.
    #
    #   **CloudHSM key stores:**
    #
    #   * `CLUSTER_NOT_FOUND` — KMS cannot find the CloudHSM cluster with
    #     the specified cluster ID.
    #
    #   * `INSUFFICIENT_CLOUDHSM_HSMS` — The associated CloudHSM cluster
    #     does not contain any active HSMs. To connect a custom key store to
    #     its CloudHSM cluster, the cluster must contain at least one active
    #     HSM.
    #
    #   * `INSUFFICIENT_FREE_ADDRESSES_IN_SUBNET` — At least one private
    #     subnet associated with the CloudHSM cluster doesn't have any
    #     available IP addresses. A CloudHSM key store connection requires
    #     one free IP address in each of the associated private subnets,
    #     although two are preferable. For details, see [How to Fix a
    #     Connection Failure][1] in the *Key Management Service Developer
    #     Guide*.
    #
    #   * `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` — The `KeyStorePassword` for the custom key
    #     store doesn't match the current password of the `kmsuser` crypto
    #     user in the CloudHSM cluster. Before you can connect your custom
    #     key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must change the `kmsuser`
    #     account password and update the `KeyStorePassword` value for the
    #     custom key store.
    #
    #   * `SUBNET_NOT_FOUND` — A subnet in the CloudHSM cluster
    #     configuration was deleted. If KMS cannot find all of the subnets
    #     in the cluster configuration, attempts to connect the custom key
    #     store to the CloudHSM cluster fail. To fix this error, create a
    #     cluster from a recent backup and associate it with your custom key
    #     store. (This process creates a new cluster configuration with a
    #     VPC and private subnets.) For details, see [How to Fix a
    #     Connection Failure][1] in the *Key Management Service Developer
    #     Guide*.
    #
    #   * `USER_LOCKED_OUT` — The `kmsuser` CU account is locked out of the
    #     associated CloudHSM cluster due to too many failed password
    #     attempts. Before you can connect your custom key store to its
    #     CloudHSM cluster, you must change the `kmsuser` account password
    #     and update the key store password value for the custom key store.
    #
    #   * `USER_LOGGED_IN` — The `kmsuser` CU account is logged into the
    #     associated CloudHSM cluster. This prevents KMS from rotating the
    #     `kmsuser` account password and logging into the cluster. Before
    #     you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you
    #     must log the `kmsuser` CU out of the cluster. If you changed the
    #     `kmsuser` password to log into the cluster, you must also and
    #     update the key store password value for the custom key store. For
    #     help, see [How to Log Out and Reconnect][2] in the *Key Management
    #     Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   * `USER_NOT_FOUND` — KMS cannot find a `kmsuser` CU account in the
    #     associated CloudHSM cluster. Before you can connect your custom
    #     key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must create a `kmsuser` CU
    #     account in the cluster, and then update the key store password
    #     value for the custom key store.
    #
    #   **External key stores:**
    #
    #   * `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` — One or both of the
    #     `XksProxyAuthenticationCredential` values is not valid on the
    #     specified external key store proxy.
    #
    #   * `XKS_PROXY_ACCESS_DENIED` — KMS requests are denied access to the
    #     external key store proxy. If the external key store proxy has
    #     authorization rules, verify that they permit KMS to communicate
    #     with the proxy on your behalf.
    #
    #   * `XKS_PROXY_INVALID_CONFIGURATION` — A configuration error is
    #     preventing the external key store from connecting to its proxy.
    #     Verify the value of the `XksProxyUriPath`.
    #
    #   * `XKS_PROXY_INVALID_RESPONSE` — KMS cannot interpret the response
    #     from the external key store proxy. If you see this connection
    #     error code repeatedly, notify your external key store proxy
    #     vendor.
    #
    #   * `XKS_PROXY_INVALID_TLS_CONFIGURATION` — KMS cannot connect to the
    #     external key store proxy because the TLS configuration is invalid.
    #     Verify that the XKS proxy supports TLS 1.2 or 1.3. Also, verify
    #     that the TLS certificate is not expired, and that it matches the
    #     hostname in the `XksProxyUriEndpoint` value, and that it is signed
    #     by a certificate authority included in the [Trusted Certificate
    #     Authorities][3] list.
    #
    #   * `XKS_PROXY_NOT_REACHABLE` — KMS can't communicate with your
    #     external key store proxy. Verify that the `XksProxyUriEndpoint`
    #     and `XksProxyUriPath` are correct. Use the tools for your external
    #     key store proxy to verify that the proxy is active and available
    #     on its network. Also, verify that your external key manager
    #     instances are operating properly. Connection attempts fail with
    #     this connection error code if the proxy reports that all external
    #     key manager instances are unavailable.
    #
    #   * `XKS_PROXY_TIMED_OUT` — KMS can connect to the external key store
    #     proxy, but the proxy does not respond to KMS in the time allotted.
    #     If you see this connection error code repeatedly, notify your
    #     external key store proxy vendor.
    #
    #   * `XKS_VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_INVALID_CONFIGURATION` — The Amazon VPC
    #     endpoint service configuration doesn't conform to the
    #     requirements for an KMS external key store.
    #
    #     * The VPC endpoint service must be an endpoint service for
    #       interface endpoints in the caller's Amazon Web Services
    #       account.
    #
    #     * It must have a network load balancer (NLB) connected to at least
    #       two subnets, each in a different Availability Zone.
    #
    #     * The `Allow principals` list must include the KMS service
    #       principal for the Region, `cks.kms.<region>.amazonaws.com`, such
    #       as `cks.kms.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.
    #
    #     * It must *not* require [acceptance][4] of connection requests.
    #
    #     * It must have a private DNS name. The private DNS name for an
    #       external key store with `VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE` connectivity must
    #       be unique in its Amazon Web Services Region.
    #
    #     * The domain of the private DNS name must have a [verification
    #       status][5] of `verified`.
    #
    #     * The [TLS certificate][6] specifies the private DNS hostname at
    #       which the endpoint is reachable.
    #
    #   * `XKS_VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_NOT_FOUND` — KMS can't find the VPC
    #     endpoint service that it uses to communicate with the external key
    #     store proxy. Verify that the `XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName` is
    #     correct and the KMS service principal has service consumer
    #     permissions on the Amazon VPC endpoint service.

    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] key_id
    #   Specifies the KMS key that KMS uses to decrypt the ciphertext.
    #
    #   Enter a key ID of the KMS key that was used to encrypt the
    #   ciphertext. If you identify a different KMS key, the `Decrypt`
    #   operation throws an `IncorrectKeyException`.
    #
    #   This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted
    #   under an asymmetric KMS key. If you used a symmetric encryption KMS
    #   key, KMS can get the KMS key from metadata that it adds to the
    #   symmetric ciphertext blob. However, it is always recommended as a
    #   best practice. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that
    #   you intend.
    #
    #   To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
    #   ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with `"alias/"`. To specify
    #   a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use
    #   the key ARN or alias ARN.
    #
    #   For example:
    #
    #   * Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Key ARN:
    #     `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Alias name: `alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   * Alias ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or
    #   DescribeKey. To get the alias name and alias ARN, use ListAliases.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] encryption_algorithm
    #   Specifies the encryption algorithm that will be used to decrypt the
    #   ciphertext. Specify the same algorithm that was used to encrypt the
    #   data. If you specify a different algorithm, the `Decrypt` operation
    #   fails.
    #
    #   This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted
    #   under an asymmetric KMS key. The default value, `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`,
    #   represents the only supported algorithm that is valid for symmetric
    #   encryption KMS keys.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] recipient
    #   A signed [attestation document][1] from an Amazon Web Services Nitro
    #   enclave and the encryption algorithm to use with the enclave's
    #   public key. The only valid encryption algorithm is
    #   `RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256`.
    #
    #   This parameter only supports attestation documents for Amazon Web
    #   Services Nitro Enclaves. To include this parameter, use the [Amazon
    #   Web Services Nitro Enclaves SDK][2] or any Amazon Web Services SDK.
    #
    #   When you use this parameter, instead of returning the plaintext
    #   data, KMS encrypts the plaintext data with the public key in the
    #   attestation document, and returns the resulting ciphertext in the
    #   `CiphertextForRecipient` field in the response. This ciphertext can
    #   be decrypted only with the private key in the enclave. The
    #   `Plaintext` field in the response is null or empty.

    #   Services Nitro Enclaves, see [How Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves

    #
    #   * The key policy must allow the calling principal to make a

    #     risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For more information,

    #   * Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more
    #     principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be
    #     visible to KMS. When you create a new Amazon Web Services
    #     principal, you might need to enforce a delay before including the
    #     new principal in a key policy because the new principal might not
    #     be immediately visible to KMS. For more information, see [Changes
    #     that I make are not always immediately visible][2] in the *Amazon
    #     Web Services Identity and Access Management User Guide*.

    #   A key policy document can include only the following characters:
    #
    #   * Printable ASCII characters from the space character (`\u0020`)
    #     through the end of the ASCII character range.
    #
    #   * Printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
    #     character set (through `\u00FF`).

    #
    #   An *encryption context* is a collection of non-secret key-value

    #   encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an
    #   exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data.
    #   An encryption context is supported only on operations with symmetric
    #   encryption KMS keys. On operations with symmetric encryption KMS

    #
    #   This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted
    #   under an asymmetric KMS key. If you used a symmetric encryption KMS

    #   `KeyUsage` value of a KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.
    #
    #   To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias

    # @!attribute [rw] policy
    #   The key policy to attach to the KMS key. This parameter is optional.
    #   If you do not provide a key policy, KMS attaches the [default key
    #   policy][1] to the KMS key.

    #   The key policy is not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You
    #   can specify the same key policy or a different key policy for each

    #   this property.
    #

    #
    #   * The key policy must allow the calling principal to make a
    #     subsequent `PutKeyPolicy` request on the KMS key. This reduces the
    #     risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For more information,

    #     `BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck` to true.)
    #
    #   * Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more
    #     principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be
    #     visible to KMS. When you create a new Amazon Web Services
    #     principal, you might need to enforce a delay before including the
    #     new principal in a key policy because the new principal might not
    #     be immediately visible to KMS. For more information, see [Changes

    #
    #   * Printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
    #     character set (through `\u00FF`).

    #
    #   Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and
    #   the tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null)
    #   string. You cannot have more than one tag on a KMS key with the same
    #   tag key. If you specify an existing tag key with a different tag
    #   value, KMS replaces the current tag value with the specified one.
    #
    #   When you add tags to an Amazon Web Services resource, Amazon Web
    #   Services generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs
    #   aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS

    #   KMS key must be `SIGN_VERIFY`. To find the `KeyUsage` of a KMS key,
    #   use the DescribeKey operation.
    #
    #   To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
    #   ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with `"alias/"`. To specify
    #   a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use
    #   the key ARN or alias ARN.
    #
    #   For example:
    #

    #
    #   * Alias ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or
    #   DescribeKey. To get the alias name and alias ARN, use ListAliases.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] message
    #   Specifies the message or message digest to sign. Messages can be
    #   0-4096 bytes. To sign a larger message, provide a message digest.
    #
    #   If you provide a message digest, use the `DIGEST` value of
    #   `MessageType` to prevent the digest from being hashed again while
    #   signing.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] message_type
    #   Tells KMS whether the value of the `Message` parameter should be
    #   hashed as part of the signing algorithm. Use `RAW` for unhashed
    #   messages; use `DIGEST` for message digests, which are already
    #   hashed.
    #
    #   When the value of `MessageType` is `RAW`, KMS uses the standard
    #   signing algorithm, which begins with a hash function. When the value
    #   is `DIGEST`, KMS skips the hashing step in the signing algorithm.
    #
    #   Use the `DIGEST` value only when the value of the `Message`
    #   parameter is a message digest. If you use the `DIGEST` value with an
    #   unhashed message, the security of the signing operation can be
    #   compromised.
    #
    #   When the value of `MessageType`is `DIGEST`, the length of the
    #   `Message` value must match the length of hashed messages for the
    #   specified signing algorithm.
    #
    #   You can submit a message digest and omit the `MessageType` or
    #   specify `RAW` so the digest is hashed again while signing. However,
    #   this can cause verification failures when verifying with a system
    #   that assumes a single hash.
    #
    #   The hashing algorithm in that `Sign` uses is based on the
    #   `SigningAlgorithm` value.
    #
    #   * Signing algorithms that end in SHA\_256 use the SHA\_256 hashing
    #     algorithm.
    #
    #   * Signing algorithms that end in SHA\_384 use the SHA\_384 hashing
    #     algorithm.
    #
    #   * Signing algorithms that end in SHA\_512 use the SHA\_512 hashing
    #     algorithm.
    #
    #   * SM2DSA uses the SM3 hashing algorithm. For details, see [Offline
    #     verification with SM2 key pairs][1].

    #   To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
    #   ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with `"alias/"`. To specify
    #   a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use
    #   the key ARN or alias ARN.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] message
    #   Specifies the message that was signed. You can submit a raw message
    #   of up to 4096 bytes, or a hash digest of the message. If you submit
    #   a digest, use the `MessageType` parameter with a value of `DIGEST`.
    #
    #   If the message specified here is different from the message that was
    #   signed, the signature verification fails. A message and its hash
    #   digest are considered to be the same message.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] message_type
    #   Tells KMS whether the value of the `Message` parameter should be
    #   hashed as part of the signing algorithm. Use `RAW` for unhashed
    #   messages; use `DIGEST` for message digests, which are already
    #   hashed.
    #
    #   When the value of `MessageType` is `RAW`, KMS uses the standard
    #   signing algorithm, which begins with a hash function. When the value
    #   is `DIGEST`, KMS skips the hashing step in the signing algorithm.
    #
    #   Use the `DIGEST` value only when the value of the `Message`
    #   parameter is a message digest. If you use the `DIGEST` value with an
    #   unhashed message, the security of the verification operation can be
    #   compromised.
    #
    #   When the value of `MessageType`is `DIGEST`, the length of the
    #   `Message` value must match the length of hashed messages for the
    #   specified signing algorithm.
    #
    #   You can submit a message digest and omit the `MessageType` or
    #   specify `RAW` so the digest is hashed again while signing. However,
    #   if the signed message is hashed once while signing, but twice while
    #   verifying, verification fails, even when the message hasn't
    #   changed.
    #
    #   The hashing algorithm in that `Verify` uses is based on the
    #   `SigningAlgorithm` value.
    #
    #   * Signing algorithms that end in SHA\_256 use the SHA\_256 hashing
    #     algorithm.
    #
    #   * Signing algorithms that end in SHA\_384 use the SHA\_384 hashing
    #     algorithm.
    #
    #   * Signing algorithms that end in SHA\_512 use the SHA\_512 hashing
    #     algorithm.
    #
    #   * SM2DSA uses the SM3 hashing algorithm. For details, see [Offline
    #     verification with SM2 key pairs][1].
