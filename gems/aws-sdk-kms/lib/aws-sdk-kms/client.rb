    #     in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #     @see https://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2015/03/backoff.html
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_limit (3)
    #     The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #     ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors

    #       unsuccessful retries a client can make.
    #
    #     * `adaptive` - An experimental retry mode that includes all the
    #       functionality of `standard` mode along with automatic client side
    #       throttling.  This is a provisional mode that may change behavior

    #     avoiding overhead of walking request parameters and response data
    #     structures.
    #
    #     When `:simple_json` is enabled, the request parameters hash must
    #     be formatted exactly as the DynamoDB API expects.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #     Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #     fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #     the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #     {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #     ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #     requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    #   @option options [Aws::TokenProvider] :token_provider

    #
    #     * `Aws::SSOTokenProvider` - Used for loading tokens from AWS SSO using an
    #       access token generated from `aws login`.
    #
    #     When `:token_provider` is not configured directly, the `Aws::TokenProviderChain`
    #     will be used to search for tokens configured for your profile in shared configuration files.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :use_dualstack_endpoint
    #     When set to `true`, dualstack enabled endpoints (with `.aws` TLD)
    #     will be used if available.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :use_fips_endpoint
    #     When set to `true`, fips compatible endpoints will be used if available.
    #     When a `fips` region is used, the region is normalized and this config
    #     is set to `true`.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #     When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #     sending the request.
    #
    #   @option options [Aws::KMS::EndpointProvider] :endpoint_provider
    #     The endpoint provider used to resolve endpoints. Any object that responds to `#resolve_endpoint(parameters)` where `parameters` is a Struct similar to `Aws::KMS::EndpointParameters`
    #

    #   @option options [Float] :http_open_timeout (15) The number of
    #     seconds to wait when opening a HTTP session before raising a
    #     `Timeout::Error`.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_read_timeout (60) The default
    #     number of seconds to wait for response data.  This value can
    #     safely be set per-request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_idle_timeout (5) The number of
    #     seconds a connection is allowed to sit idle before it is
    #     considered stale.  Stale connections are closed and removed
    #     from the pool before making a request.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_continue_timeout (1) The number of
    #     seconds to wait for a 100-continue response before sending the
    #     request body.  This option has no effect unless the request has
    #     "Expect" header set to "100-continue".  Defaults to `nil` which
    #     disables this behaviour.  This value can safely be set per
    #     request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :ssl_timeout (nil) Sets the SSL timeout
    #     in seconds.
    #

    #     HTTP debug output will be sent to the `:logger`.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :ssl_verify_peer (true) When `true`,
    #     SSL peer certificates are verified when establishing a
    #     connection.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_bundle Full path to the SSL
    #     certificate authority bundle file that should be used when
    #     verifying peer certificates.  If you do not pass
    #     `:ssl_ca_bundle` or `:ssl_ca_directory` the the system default
    #     will be used if available.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_directory Full path of the
    #     directory that contains the unbundled SSL certificate
    #     authority files for verifying peer certificates.  If you do
    #     not pass `:ssl_ca_bundle` or `:ssl_ca_directory` the the

    # store. For an CloudHSM key store, `ConnectCustomKeyStore` connects the
    # key store to its associated CloudHSM cluster. For an external key
    # store, `ConnectCustomKeyStore` connects the key store to the external
    # key store proxy that communicates with your external key manager.
    #
    # The custom key store must be connected before you can create KMS keys
    # in the key store or use the KMS keys it contains. You can disconnect
    # and reconnect a custom key store at any time.
    #
    # The connection process for a custom key store can take an extended
    # amount of time to complete. This operation starts the connection
    # process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds,
    # this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object
    # with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the
    # custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the
    # custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
    #
    # This operation is part of the [custom key stores][1] feature in KMS,
    # which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with
    # the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage.
    #
    # The `ConnectCustomKeyStore` operation might fail for various reasons.
    # To find the reason, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see
    # the `ConnectionErrorCode` in the response. For help interpreting the
    # `ConnectionErrorCode`, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry.
    #
    # To fix the failure, use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to
    # disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the
    # UpdateCustomKeyStore operation if necessary, and then use
    # `ConnectCustomKeyStore` again.
    #
    # **CloudHSM key store**
    #
    # During the connection process for an CloudHSM key store, KMS finds the
    # CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates
    # the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the
    # CloudHSM client as the `kmsuser` CU, and rotates its password.
    #
    # To connect an CloudHSM key store, its associated CloudHSM cluster must
    # have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a
    # cluster, use the [DescribeClusters][2] operation. To add HSMs to the
    # cluster, use the [CreateHsm][3] operation. Also, the [ `kmsuser`
    # crypto user][4] (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This
    # prevents KMS from using this account to log in.
    #
    # If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a CloudHSM key
    # store, see [Troubleshooting an CloudHSM key store][5] in the *Key
    # Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # **External key store**
    #
    # When you connect an external key store that uses public endpoint
    # connectivity, KMS tests its ability to communicate with your external
    # key manager by sending a request via the external key store proxy.
    #
    # When you connect to an external key store that uses VPC endpoint
    # service connectivity, KMS establishes the networking elements that it
    # needs to communicate with your external key manager via the external
    # key store proxy. This includes creating an interface endpoint to the
    # VPC endpoint service and a private hosted zone for traffic between KMS
    # and the VPC endpoint service.
    #
    # To connect an external key store, KMS must be able to connect to the
    # external key store proxy, the external key store proxy must be able to
    # communicate with your external key manager, and the external key
    # manager must be available for cryptographic operations.
    #
    # If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting an external key
    # store, see [Troubleshooting an external key store][6] in the *Key
    # Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # **Cross-account use**: No. You cannot perform this operation on a

    #
    #   **Uniqueness requirements:**
    #
    #   * External key stores with `VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE` connectivity can
    #     share an Amazon VPC, but each external key store must have its own
    #     VPC endpoint service and private DNS name.

    #
    # @option params [Types::XksProxyAuthenticationCredentialType] :xks_proxy_authentication_credential
    #   Specifies an authentication credential for the external key store
    #   proxy (XKS proxy). This parameter is required for all custom key
    #   stores with a `CustomKeyStoreType` of `EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE`.
    #
    #   The `XksProxyAuthenticationCredential` has two required elements:
    #   `RawSecretAccessKey`, a secret key, and `AccessKeyId`, a unique
    #   identifier for the `RawSecretAccessKey`. For character requirements,
    #   see
    #   [XksProxyAuthenticationCredentialType](kms/latest/APIReference/API_XksProxyAuthenticationCredentialType.html).
    #
    #   KMS uses this authentication credential to sign requests to the
    #   external key store proxy on your behalf. This credential is unrelated
    #   to Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon Web Services
    #   credentials.
    #
    #   This parameter doesn't set or change the authentication credentials
    #   on the XKS proxy. It just tells KMS the credential that you
    #   established on your external key store proxy. If you rotate your proxy
    #   authentication credential, use the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation to
    #   provide the new credential to KMS.
    #
    # @option params [String] :xks_proxy_connectivity
    #   Indicates how KMS communicates with the external key store proxy. This
    #   parameter is required for custom key stores with a
    #   `CustomKeyStoreType` of `EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE`.
    #
    #   If the external key store proxy uses a public endpoint, specify
    #   `PUBLIC_ENDPOINT`. If the external key store proxy uses a Amazon VPC
    #   endpoint service for communication with KMS, specify
    #   `VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE`. For help making this choice, see [Choosing a
    #   connectivity option][1] in the *Key Management Service Developer
    #   Guide*.
    #
    #   An Amazon VPC endpoint service keeps your communication with KMS in a
    #   private address space entirely within Amazon Web Services, but it
    #   requires more configuration, including establishing a Amazon VPC with
    #   multiple subnets, a VPC endpoint service, a network load balancer, and
    #   a verified private DNS name. A public endpoint is simpler to set up,
    #   but it might be slower and might not fulfill your security
    #   requirements. You might consider testing with a public endpoint, and
    #   then establishing a VPC endpoint service for production tasks. Note
    #   that this choice does not determine the location of the external key
    #   store proxy. Even if you choose a VPC endpoint service, the proxy can
    #   be hosted within the VPC or outside of Amazon Web Services such as in
    #   your corporate data center.

    # Adds a grant to a KMS key.
    #
    # A *grant* is a policy instrument that allows Amazon Web Services
    # principals to use KMS keys in cryptographic operations. It also can
    # allow them to view a KMS key (DescribeKey) and create and manage
    # grants. When authorizing access to a KMS key, grants are considered
    # along with key policies and IAM policies. Grants are often used for
    # temporary permissions because you can create one, use its permissions,
    # and delete it without changing your key policies or IAM policies.
    #
    # For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology,
    # see [Grants in KMS][1] in the <i> <i>Key Management Service Developer
    # Guide</i> </i>. For examples of working with grants in several
    # programming languages, see [Programming grants][2].
    #
    # The `CreateGrant` operation returns a `GrantToken` and a `GrantId`.
    #
    # * When you create, retire, or revoke a grant, there might be a brief
    #   delay, usually less than five minutes, until the grant is available
    #   throughout KMS. This state is known as *eventual consistency*. Once
    #   the grant has achieved eventual consistency, the grantee principal
    #   can use the permissions in the grant without identifying the grant.
    #
    #   However, to use the permissions in the grant immediately, use the
    #   `GrantToken` that `CreateGrant` returns. For details, see [Using a
    #   grant token][3] in the <i> <i>Key Management Service Developer
    #   Guide</i> </i>.
    #
    # * The `CreateGrant` operation also returns a `GrantId`. You can use
    #   the `GrantId` and a key identifier to identify the grant in the
    #   RetireGrant and RevokeGrant operations. To find the grant ID, use
    #   the ListGrants or ListRetirableGrants operations.
    #
    # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible
    # key state. For details, see [Key states of KMS keys][4] in the *Key
    # Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation on a KMS key in
    # a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN in the
    # value of the `KeyId` parameter.
    #
    # **Required permissions**: [kms:CreateGrant][5] (key policy)
    #
    # **Related operations:**
    #
    # * ListGrants
    #
    # * ListRetirableGrants
    #
    # * RetireGrant
    #
    # * RevokeGrant

    # @option params [required, String] :key_id
    #   Identifies the KMS key for the grant. The grant gives principals
    #   permission to use this KMS key.
    #
    #   Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key. To specify a KMS key in
    #   a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the key ARN.
    #
    #   For example:
    #
    #   * Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Key ARN:
    #     `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or
    #   DescribeKey.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :grantee_principal
    #   The identity that gets the permissions specified in the grant.
    #
    #   To specify the grantee principal, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
    #   of an Amazon Web Services principal. Valid principals include Amazon
    #   Web Services accounts, IAM users, IAM roles, federated users, and
    #   assumed role users. For help with the ARN syntax for a principal, see

    #   [1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-arns
    #
    # @option params [String] :retiring_principal
    #   The principal that has permission to use the RetireGrant operation to
    #   retire the grant.
    #
    #   To specify the principal, use the [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)][1] of
    #   an Amazon Web Services principal. Valid principals include Amazon Web
    #   Services accounts, IAM users, IAM roles, federated users, and assumed
    #   role users. For help with the ARN syntax for a principal, see [IAM
    #   ARNs][2] in the <i> <i>Identity and Access Management User Guide</i>
    #   </i>.
    #
    #   The grant determines the retiring principal. Other principals might
    #   have permission to retire the grant or revoke the grant. For details,
    #   see RevokeGrant and [Retiring and revoking grants][3] in the *Key
    #   Management Service Developer Guide*.

    # @option params [required, Array<String>] :operations
    #   A list of operations that the grant permits.
    #
    #   This list must include only operations that are permitted in a grant.
    #   Also, the operation must be supported on the KMS key. For example, you
    #   cannot create a grant for a symmetric encryption KMS key that allows
    #   the Sign operation, or a grant for an asymmetric KMS key that allows
    #   the GenerateDataKey operation. If you try, KMS returns a
    #   `ValidationError` exception. For details, see [Grant operations][1] in
    #   the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

    # @option params [Types::GrantConstraints] :constraints
    #   Specifies a grant constraint.
    #
    #   Do not include confidential or sensitive information in this field.
    #   This field may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other
    #   output.
    #
    #   KMS supports the `EncryptionContextEquals` and
    #   `EncryptionContextSubset` grant constraints, which allow the
    #   permissions in the grant only when the encryption context in the
    #   request matches (`EncryptionContextEquals`) or includes
    #   (`EncryptionContextSubset`) the encryption context specified in the
    #   constraint.
    #
    #   The encryption context grant constraints are supported only on [grant
    #   operations][1] that include an `EncryptionContext` parameter, such as
    #   cryptographic operations on symmetric encryption KMS keys. Grants with
    #   grant constraints can include the DescribeKey and RetireGrant
    #   operations, but the constraint doesn't apply to these operations. If
    #   a grant with a grant constraint includes the `CreateGrant` operation,
    #   the constraint requires that any grants created with the `CreateGrant`
    #   permission have an equally strict or stricter encryption context
    #   constraint.
    #
    #   You cannot use an encryption context grant constraint for
    #   cryptographic operations with asymmetric KMS keys or HMAC KMS keys.
    #   Operations with these keys don't support an encryption context.
    #
    #   Each constraint value can include up to 8 encryption context pairs.
    #   The encryption context value in each constraint cannot exceed 384
    #   characters. For information about grant constraints, see [Using grant
    #   constraints][2] in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*. For
    #   more information about encryption context, see [Encryption context][3]

    # @option params [Array<String>] :grant_tokens
    #   A list of grant tokens.

    #   This field may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other
    #   output.
    #
    #   When this value is absent, all `CreateGrant` requests result in a new
    #   grant with a unique `GrantId` even if all the supplied parameters are
    #   identical. This can result in unintended duplicates when you retry the
    #   `CreateGrant` request.
    #
    #   When this value is present, you can retry a `CreateGrant` request with
    #   identical parameters; if the grant already exists, the original
    #   `GrantId` is returned without creating a new grant. Note that the
    #   returned grant token is unique with every `CreateGrant` request, even
    #   when a duplicate `GrantId` is returned. All grant tokens for the same
    #   grant ID can be used interchangeably.

    # Creates a unique customer managed [KMS key][1] in your Amazon Web
    # Services account and Region. You can use a KMS key in cryptographic
    # operations, such as encryption and signing. Some Amazon Web Services
    # services let you use KMS keys that you create and manage to protect
    # your service resources.
    #
    # A KMS key is a logical representation of a cryptographic key. In
    # addition to the key material used in cryptographic operations, a KMS
    # key includes metadata, such as the key ID, key policy, creation date,
    # description, and key state. For details, see [Managing keys][2] in the
    # *Key Management Service Developer Guide*
    #
    # Use the parameters of `CreateKey` to specify the type of KMS key, the
    # source of its key material, its key policy, description, tags, and
    # other properties.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> KMS has replaced the term *customer master key (CMK)* with *KMS key*
    # and *KMS key*. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking
    # changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # To create different types of KMS keys, use the following guidance:
    #
    # Symmetric encryption KMS key
    #
    # : By default, `CreateKey` creates a symmetric encryption KMS key with
    #   key material that KMS generates. This is the basic and most widely
    #   used type of KMS key, and provides the best performance.
    #
    #   To create a symmetric encryption KMS key, you don't need to specify
    #   any parameters. The default value for `KeySpec`,
    #   `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, the default value for `KeyUsage`,
    #   `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`, and the default value for `Origin`, `AWS_KMS`,
    #   create a symmetric encryption KMS key with KMS key material.
    #
    #   If you need a key for basic encryption and decryption or you are
    #   creating a KMS key to protect your resources in an Amazon Web
    #   Services service, create a symmetric encryption KMS key. The key
    #   material in a symmetric encryption key never leaves KMS unencrypted.
    #   You can use a symmetric encryption KMS key to encrypt and decrypt
    #   data up to 4,096 bytes, but they are typically used to generate data
    #   keys and data keys pairs. For details, see GenerateDataKey and
    #   GenerateDataKeyPair.
    #
    #
    #
    # Asymmetric KMS keys
    #
    # : To create an asymmetric KMS key, use the `KeySpec` parameter to
    #   specify the type of key material in the KMS key. Then, use the
    #   `KeyUsage` parameter to determine whether the KMS key will be used
    #   to encrypt and decrypt or sign and verify. You can't change these
    #   properties after the KMS key is created.
    #
    #   Asymmetric KMS keys contain an RSA key pair, Elliptic Curve (ECC)
    #   key pair, or an SM2 key pair (China Regions only). The private key
    #   in an asymmetric KMS key never leaves KMS unencrypted. However, you
    #   can use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key so it
    #   can be used outside of KMS. KMS keys with RSA or SM2 key pairs can
    #   be used to encrypt or decrypt data or sign and verify messages (but
    #   not both). KMS keys with ECC key pairs can be used only to sign and
    #   verify messages. For information about asymmetric KMS keys, see
    #   [Asymmetric KMS keys][3] in the *Key Management Service Developer
    #   Guide*.
    #
    #
    #
    # HMAC KMS key
    #
    # : To create an HMAC KMS key, set the `KeySpec` parameter to a key spec
    #   value for HMAC KMS keys. Then set the `KeyUsage` parameter to
    #   `GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC`. You must set the key usage even though
    #   `GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC` is the only valid key usage value for HMAC KMS
    #   keys. You can't change these properties after the KMS key is
    #   created.
    #
    #   HMAC KMS keys are symmetric keys that never leave KMS unencrypted.
    #   You can use HMAC keys to generate (GenerateMac) and verify
    #   (VerifyMac) HMAC codes for messages up to 4096 bytes.
    #
    #
    #
    # Multi-Region primary keys
    # Imported key material
    #
    # : To create a multi-Region *primary key* in the local Amazon Web
    #   Services Region, use the `MultiRegion` parameter with a value of
    #   `True`. To create a multi-Region *replica key*, that is, a KMS key
    #   with the same key ID and key material as a primary key, but in a
    #   different Amazon Web Services Region, use the ReplicateKey
    #   operation. To change a replica key to a primary key, and its primary
    #   key to a replica key, use the UpdatePrimaryRegion operation.
    #
    #   You can create multi-Region KMS keys for all supported KMS key
    #   types: symmetric encryption KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, asymmetric
    #   encryption KMS keys, and asymmetric signing KMS keys. You can also
    #   create multi-Region keys with imported key material. However, you
    #   can't create multi-Region keys in a custom key store.
    #
    #   This operation supports *multi-Region keys*, an KMS feature that
    #   lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon
    #   Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID,
    #   key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably
    #   to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in
    #   a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the
    #   data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about
    #   multi-Region keys, see [Multi-Region keys in KMS][4] in the *Key
    #   Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #
    #
    # : To import your own key material into a KMS key, begin by creating a
    #   KMS key with no key material. To do this, use the `Origin` parameter
    #   of `CreateKey` with a value of `EXTERNAL`. Next, use
    #   GetParametersForImport operation to get a public key and import
    #   token. Use the wrapping public key to encrypt your key material.
    #   Then, use ImportKeyMaterial with your import token to import the key
    #   material. For step-by-step instructions, see [Importing Key
    #   Material][5] in the <i> <i>Key Management Service Developer
    #   Guide</i> </i>.
    #
    #   You can import key material into KMS keys of all supported KMS key
    #   types: symmetric encryption KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, asymmetric
    #   encryption KMS keys, and asymmetric signing KMS keys. You can also
    #   create multi-Region keys with imported key material. However, you
    #   can't import key material into a KMS key in a custom key store.
    #
    #   To create a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, use
    #   the `Origin` parameter of `CreateKey` with a value of `EXTERNAL` and
    #   the `MultiRegion` parameter with a value of `True`. To create
    #   replicas of the multi-Region primary key, use the ReplicateKey
    #   operation. For instructions, see [Importing key material into
    #   multi-Region keys][6]. For more information about multi-Region keys,
    #   see [Multi-Region keys in KMS][4] in the *Key Management Service
    #   Developer Guide*.
    #
    #
    #
    # Custom key store
    #
    # : A [custom key store][7] lets you protect your Amazon Web Services
    #   resources using keys in a backing key store that you own and manage.
    #   When you request a cryptographic operation with a KMS key in a
    #   custom key store, the operation is performed in the backing key
    #   store using its cryptographic keys.
    #
    #   KMS supports [CloudHSM key stores][8] backed by an CloudHSM cluster
    #   and [external key stores][9] backed by an external key manager
    #   outside of Amazon Web Services. When you create a KMS key in an
    #   CloudHSM key store, KMS generates an encryption key in the CloudHSM
    #   cluster and associates it with the KMS key. When you create a KMS
    #   key in an external key store, you specify an existing encryption key
    #   in the external key manager.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating a
    #   KMS key in an external key store. For details, see your external key
    #   manager documentation.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   Before you create a KMS key in a custom key store, the
    #   `ConnectionState` of the key store must be `CONNECTED`. To connect
    #   the custom key store, use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation. To
    #   find the `ConnectionState`, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores
    #   operation.
    #
    #   To create a KMS key in a custom key store, use the
    #   `CustomKeyStoreId`. Use the default `KeySpec` value,
    #   `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, and the default `KeyUsage` value,
    #   `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT` to create a symmetric encryption key. No other key
    #   type is supported in a custom key store.
    #
    #   To create a KMS key in an [CloudHSM key store][8], use the `Origin`
    #   parameter with a value of `AWS_CLOUDHSM`. The CloudHSM cluster that
    #   is associated with the custom key store must have at least two
    #   active HSMs in different Availability Zones in the Amazon Web
    #   Services Region.
    #
    #   To create a KMS key in an [external key store][9], use the `Origin`
    #   parameter with a value of `EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE` and an `XksKeyId`
    #   parameter that identifies an existing external key.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating a
    #   KMS key in an external key store. For details, see your external key
    #   manager documentation.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    # **Cross-account use**: No. You cannot use this operation to create a
    # KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account.
    #
    # **Required permissions**: [kms:CreateKey][10] (IAM policy). To use the
    # `Tags` parameter, [kms:TagResource][10] (IAM policy). For examples and
    # information about related permissions, see [Allow a user to create KMS
    # keys][11] in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

    #
    # @option params [String] :policy
    #   The key policy to attach to the KMS key.
    #
    #   If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:
    #
    #   * The key policy must allow the calling principal to make a subsequent
    #     `PutKeyPolicy` request on the KMS key. This reduces the risk that
    #     the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For more information, see [Default
    #     key policy][1] in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*. (To
    #     omit this condition, set `BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck` to true.)
    #
    #   * Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more
    #     principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be
    #     visible to KMS. When you create a new Amazon Web Services principal,
    #     you might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal
    #     in a key policy because the new principal might not be immediately
    #     visible to KMS. For more information, see [Changes that I make are
    #     not always immediately visible][2] in the *Amazon Web Services
    #     Identity and Access Management User Guide*.
    #
    #   If you do not provide a key policy, KMS attaches a default key policy
    #   to the KMS key. For more information, see [Default key policy][3] in
    #   the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   The key policy size quota is 32 kilobytes (32768 bytes).
    #
    #   For help writing and formatting a JSON policy document, see the [IAM
    #   JSON Policy Reference][4] in the <i> <i>Identity and Access Management
    #   User Guide</i> </i>.

    #
    # @option params [String] :description
    #   A description of the KMS key. Use a description that helps you decide
    #   whether the KMS key is appropriate for a task. The default value is an
    #   empty string (no description).
    #
    #   Do not include confidential or sensitive information in this field.
    #   This field may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other
    #   output.
    #
    #   To set or change the description after the key is created, use
    #   UpdateKeyDescription.
    #
    # @option params [String] :key_usage
    #   Determines the [cryptographic operations][1] for which you can use the
    #   KMS key. The default value is `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`. This parameter is
    #   optional when you are creating a symmetric encryption KMS key;
    #   otherwise, it is required. You can't change the `KeyUsage` value
    #   after the KMS key is created.
    #
    #   Select only one valid value.
    #
    #   * For symmetric encryption KMS keys, omit the parameter or specify
    #     `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`.
    #
    #   * For HMAC KMS keys (symmetric), specify `GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC`.
    #
    #   * For asymmetric KMS keys with RSA key material, specify
    #     `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT` or `SIGN_VERIFY`.
    #
    #   * For asymmetric KMS keys with ECC key material, specify
    #     `SIGN_VERIFY`.
    #
    #   * For asymmetric KMS keys with SM2 key material (China Regions only),
    #     specify `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT` or `SIGN_VERIFY`.

    #
    # @option params [String] :customer_master_key_spec
    #   Instead, use the `KeySpec` parameter.
    #
    #   The `KeySpec` and `CustomerMasterKeySpec` parameters work the same
    #   way. Only the names differ. We recommend that you use `KeySpec`
    #   parameter in your code. However, to avoid breaking changes, KMS
    #   supports both parameters.
    #
    # @option params [String] :key_spec
    #   Specifies the type of KMS key to create. The default value,
    #   `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, creates a KMS key with a 256-bit AES-GCM key that
    #   is used for encryption and decryption, except in China Regions, where
    #   it creates a 128-bit symmetric key that uses SM4 encryption. For help
    #   choosing a key spec for your KMS key, see [Choosing a KMS key type][1]
    #   in the <i> <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i> </i>.
    #
    #   The `KeySpec` determines whether the KMS key contains a symmetric key
    #   or an asymmetric key pair. It also determines the algorithms that the
    #   KMS key supports. You can't change the `KeySpec` after the KMS key is
    #   created. To further restrict the algorithms that can be used with the
    #   KMS key, use a condition key in its key policy or IAM policy. For more
    #   information, see [kms:EncryptionAlgorithm][2], [kms:MacAlgorithm][3]
    #   or [kms:Signing Algorithm][4] in the <i> <i>Key Management Service
    #   Developer Guide</i> </i>.
    #
    #   [Amazon Web Services services that are integrated with KMS][5] use
    #   symmetric encryption KMS keys to protect your data. These services do
    #   not support asymmetric KMS keys or HMAC KMS keys.
    #
    #   KMS supports the following key specs for KMS keys:
    #
    #   * Symmetric encryption key (default)
    #
    #     * `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`
    #
    #     ^
    #
    #   * HMAC keys (symmetric)

    # @option params [String] :origin
    #   The source of the key material for the KMS key. You cannot change the
    #   origin after you create the KMS key. The default is `AWS_KMS`, which
    #   means that KMS creates the key material.
    #
    #   To [create a KMS key with no key material][1] (for imported key
    #   material), set this value to `EXTERNAL`. For more information about
    #   importing key material into KMS, see [Importing Key Material][2] in
    #   the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*. The `EXTERNAL` origin
    #   value is valid only for symmetric KMS keys.
    #
    #   To [create a KMS key in an CloudHSM key store][3] and create its key
    #   material in the associated CloudHSM cluster, set this value to
    #   `AWS_CLOUDHSM`. You must also use the `CustomKeyStoreId` parameter to
    #   identify the CloudHSM key store. The `KeySpec` value must be
    #   `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`.
    #
    #   To [create a KMS key in an external key store][4], set this value to
    #   `EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE`. You must also use the `CustomKeyStoreId`
    #   parameter to identify the external key store and the `XksKeyId`
    #   parameter to identify the associated external key. The `KeySpec` value
    #   must be `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`.

    # @option params [String] :custom_key_store_id
    #   Creates the KMS key in the specified [custom key store][1]. The
    #   `ConnectionState` of the custom key store must be `CONNECTED`. To find
    #   the CustomKeyStoreID and ConnectionState use the
    #   DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
    #
    #   This parameter is valid only for symmetric encryption KMS keys in a
    #   single Region. You cannot create any other type of KMS key in a custom
    #   key store.
    #
    #   When you create a KMS key in an CloudHSM key store, KMS generates a
    #   non-exportable 256-bit symmetric key in its associated CloudHSM
    #   cluster and associates it with the KMS key. When you create a KMS key
    #   in an external key store, you must use the `XksKeyId` parameter to
    #   specify an external key that serves as key material for the KMS key.

    #   Skips ("bypasses") the key policy lockout safety check. The default
    #   value is false.
    #
    #   Setting this value to true increases the risk that the KMS key becomes
    #   unmanageable. Do not set this value to true indiscriminately.

    #   key. For details, see [ABAC for KMS][1] in the *Key Management Service
    #   Developer Guide*.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   To use this parameter, you must have [kms:TagResource][2] permission
    #   in an IAM policy.
    #
    #   Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and
    #   the tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null)
    #   string. You cannot have more than one tag on a KMS key with the same
    #   tag key. If you specify an existing tag key with a different tag
    #   value, KMS replaces the current tag value with the specified one.
    #
    #   When you add tags to an Amazon Web Services resource, Amazon Web
    #   Services generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs
    #   aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS
    #   key. For details, see [Tagging Keys][3].

    #
    # @option params [Boolean] :multi_region
    #   Creates a multi-Region primary key that you can replicate into other
    #   Amazon Web Services Regions. You cannot change this value after you
    #   create the KMS key.
    #
    #   For a multi-Region key, set this parameter to `True`. For a
    #   single-Region KMS key, omit this parameter or set it to `False`. The
    #   default value is `False`.
    #
    #   This operation supports *multi-Region keys*, an KMS feature that lets
    #   you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web
    #   Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key
    #   material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to
    #   encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a
    #   different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or
    #   making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region
    #   keys, see [Multi-Region keys in KMS][1] in the *Key Management Service
    #   Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   This value creates a *primary key*, not a replica. To create a
    #   *replica key*, use the ReplicateKey operation.
    #
    #   You can create a symmetric or asymmetric multi-Region key, and you can
    #   create a multi-Region key with imported key material. However, you
    #   cannot create a multi-Region key in a custom key store.
    #

    #
    # @option params [String] :xks_key_id
    #   Identifies the [external key][1] that serves as key material for the
    #   KMS key in an [external key store][2]. Specify the ID that the
    #   [external key store proxy][3] uses to refer to the external key. For
    #   help, see the documentation for your external key store proxy.
    #
    #   This parameter is required for a KMS key with an `Origin` value of
    #   `EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE`. It is not valid for KMS keys with any other
    #   `Origin` value.
    #
    #   The external key must be an existing 256-bit AES symmetric encryption
    #   key hosted outside of Amazon Web Services in an external key manager
    #   associated with the external key store specified by the
    #   `CustomKeyStoreId` parameter. This key must be enabled and configured
    #   to perform encryption and decryption. Each KMS key in an external key
    #   store must use a different external key. For details, see
    #   [Requirements for a KMS key in an external key store][4] in the *Key
    #   Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   Each KMS key in an external key store is associated two backing keys.
    #   One is key material that KMS generates. The other is the external key
    #   specified by this parameter. When you use the KMS key in an external
    #   key store to encrypt data, the encryption operation is performed first
    #   by KMS using the KMS key material, and then by the external key
    #   manager using the specified external key, a process known as *double
    #   encryption*. For details, see [Double encryption][5] in the *Key
    #   Management Service Developer Guide*.

    # Decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted by a KMS key using any of the

    #

    # * GenerateDataKey
    #
    # * GenerateDataKeyPair
    #
    # * GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext
    #
    # * GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext
    #
    # You can use this operation to decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted
    # under a symmetric encryption KMS key or an asymmetric encryption KMS
    # key. When the KMS key is asymmetric, you must specify the KMS key and
    # the encryption algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. For
    # information about asymmetric KMS keys, see [Asymmetric KMS keys][1] in
    # the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # The `Decrypt` operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted
    # outside of KMS by the public key in an KMS asymmetric KMS key.
    # However, it cannot decrypt symmetric ciphertext produced by other
    # libraries, such as the [Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK][2] or
    # [Amazon S3 client-side encryption][3]. These libraries return a
    # ciphertext format that is incompatible with KMS.
    #
    # If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key,
    # the `KeyId` parameter is optional. KMS can get this information from
    # metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature
    # adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized
    # users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if
    # they've lost track of the key ID. However, specifying the KMS key is
    # always recommended as a best practice. When you use the `KeyId`
    # parameter to specify a KMS key, KMS only uses the KMS key you specify.
    # If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different KMS key, the
    # `Decrypt` operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS
    # key that you intend.
    #
    # Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call
    # the `Decrypt` operation on a particular KMS key, instead of using
    # &amp;IAM; policies. Otherwise, you might create an &amp;IAM; policy
    # that gives the user `Decrypt` permission on all KMS keys. This user
    # could decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by KMS keys in other
    # accounts if the key policy for the cross-account KMS key permits it.
    # If you must use an IAM policy for `Decrypt` permissions, limit the
    # user to particular KMS keys or particular trusted accounts. For
    # details, see [Best practices for IAM policies][4] in the *Key
    # Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # `Decrypt` also supports [Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves][5], which
    # provide an isolated compute environment in Amazon EC2. To call
    # `Decrypt` for a Nitro enclave, use the [Amazon Web Services Nitro
    # Enclaves SDK][6] or any Amazon Web Services SDK. Use the `Recipient`
    # parameter to provide the attestation document for the enclave. Instead
    # of the plaintext data, the response includes the plaintext data
    # encrypted with the public key from the attestation document
    # (`CiphertextForRecipient`).For information about the interaction
    # between KMS and Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves, see [How Amazon
    # Web Services Nitro Enclaves uses KMS][7] in the *Key Management
    # Service Developer Guide*..
    #
    # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible
    # key state. For details, see [Key states of KMS keys][8] in the *Key
    # Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # **Cross-account use**: Yes. If you use the `KeyId` parameter to
    # identify a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify
    # the key ARN or the alias ARN of the KMS key.
    #

    # @option params [required, String, StringIO, File] :ciphertext_blob
    #   Ciphertext to be decrypted. The blob includes metadata.
    #
    # @option params [Hash<String,String>] :encryption_context
    #   Specifies the encryption context to use when decrypting the data. An
    #   encryption context is valid only for [cryptographic operations][1]
    #   with a symmetric encryption KMS key. The standard asymmetric
    #   encryption algorithms and HMAC algorithms that KMS uses do not support
    #   an encryption context.
    #
    #   An *encryption context* is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs
    #   that represent additional authenticated data. When you use an
    #   encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an
    #   exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An
    #   encryption context is supported only on operations with symmetric
    #   encryption KMS keys. On operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys,
    #   an encryption context is optional, but it is strongly recommended.
    #
    #   For more information, see [Encryption context][2] in the *Key
    #   Management Service Developer Guide*.

    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :grant_tokens
    #   A list of grant tokens.
    #
    #   Use a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes
    #   from a new grant that has not yet achieved *eventual consistency*. For
    #   more information, see [Grant token][1] and [Using a grant token][2] in
    #   the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

    #
    # @option params [String] :key_id
    #   Specifies the KMS key that KMS uses to decrypt the ciphertext.
    #
    #   Enter a key ID of the KMS key that was used to encrypt the ciphertext.
    #   If you identify a different KMS key, the `Decrypt` operation throws an
    #   `IncorrectKeyException`.
    #
    #   This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted
    #   under an asymmetric KMS key. If you used a symmetric encryption KMS
    #   key, KMS can get the KMS key from metadata that it adds to the
    #   symmetric ciphertext blob. However, it is always recommended as a best
    #   practice. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you
    #   intend.
    #
    #   To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
    #   ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with `"alias/"`. To specify a
    #   KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the
    #   key ARN or alias ARN.
    #
    #   For example:
    #
    #   * Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Key ARN:
    #     `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Alias name: `alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   * Alias ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or
    #   DescribeKey. To get the alias name and alias ARN, use ListAliases.
    #
    # @option params [String] :encryption_algorithm
    #   Specifies the encryption algorithm that will be used to decrypt the
    #   ciphertext. Specify the same algorithm that was used to encrypt the
    #   data. If you specify a different algorithm, the `Decrypt` operation
    #   fails.
    #
    #   This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted
    #   under an asymmetric KMS key. The default value, `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`,
    #   represents the only supported algorithm that is valid for symmetric
    #   encryption KMS keys.
    #
    # @option params [Types::RecipientInfo] :recipient
    #   A signed [attestation document][1] from an Amazon Web Services Nitro
    #   enclave and the encryption algorithm to use with the enclave's public
    #   key. The only valid encryption algorithm is `RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256`.
    #
    #   This parameter only supports attestation documents for Amazon Web
    #   Services Nitro Enclaves. To include this parameter, use the [Amazon
    #   Web Services Nitro Enclaves SDK][2] or any Amazon Web Services SDK.
    #
    #   When you use this parameter, instead of returning the plaintext data,
    #   KMS encrypts the plaintext data with the public key in the attestation
    #   document, and returns the resulting ciphertext in the
    #   `CiphertextForRecipient` field in the response. This ciphertext can be
    #   decrypted only with the private key in the enclave. The `Plaintext`
    #   field in the response is null or empty.
    #
    #   For information about the interaction between KMS and Amazon Web
    #   Services Nitro Enclaves, see [How Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves
    #   uses KMS][3] in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

    # Deletes a [custom key store][1]. This operation does not affect any
    # backing elements of the custom key store. It does not delete the
    # CloudHSM cluster that is associated with an CloudHSM key store, or
    # affect any users or keys in the cluster. For an external key store, it
    # does not affect the external key store proxy, external key manager, or
    # any external keys.
    #
    # This operation is part of the [custom key stores][1] feature in KMS,
    # which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with
    # the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage.
    #
    # The custom key store that you delete cannot contain any [KMS keys][2].
    # Before deleting the key store, verify that you will never need to use
    # any of the KMS keys in the key store for any [cryptographic
    # operations][3]. Then, use ScheduleKeyDeletion to delete the KMS keys
    # from the key store. After the required waiting period expires and all
    # KMS keys are deleted from the custom key store, use
    # DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect the key store from KMS. Then,
    # you can delete the custom key store.
    #
    # For keys in an CloudHSM key store, the `ScheduleKeyDeletion` operation
    # makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated
    # cluster. However, you might need to manually [delete the orphaned key
    # material][4] from the cluster and its backups. KMS never creates,
    # manages, or deletes cryptographic keys in the external key manager
    # associated with an external key store. You must manage them using your
    # external key manager tools.
    #
    # Instead of deleting the custom key store, consider using the
    # DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store
    # from its backing key store. While the key store is disconnected, you
    # cannot create or use the KMS keys in the key store. But, you do not
    # need to delete KMS keys and you can reconnect a disconnected custom
    # key store at any time.
    #
    # If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no
    # properties.
    #
    # **Cross-account use**: No. You cannot perform this operation on a
    # custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

    #

    # cluster or external key store proxy, use the `ConnectionState` element
    # in the response. If an attempt to connect the custom key store failed,
    # the `ConnectionState` value is `FAILED` and the `ConnectionErrorCode`
    # element in the response indicates the cause of the failure. For help
    # interpreting the `ConnectionErrorCode`, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry.
    #
    # Custom key stores have a `DISCONNECTED` connection state if the key
    # store has never been connected or you used the
    # DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect it. Otherwise, the
    # connection state is CONNECTED. If your custom key store connection
    # state is `CONNECTED` but you are having trouble using it, verify that

    # stores](kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-cloudhsm.html), it includes
    # information about the key store, such as the key store ID and the
    # CloudHSM cluster ID. For KMS keys in [external key
    # stores](kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html), it includes
    # the custom key store ID and the ID of the external key.
    #
    # `DescribeKey` does not return the following information:
    #
    # * Aliases associated with the KMS key. To get this information, use
    #   ListAliases.
    #
    # * Whether automatic key rotation is enabled on the KMS key. To get
    #   this information, use GetKeyRotationStatus. Also, some key states
    #   prevent a KMS key from being automatically rotated. For details, see
    #   [How Automatic Key Rotation Works][3] in the *Key Management Service
    #   Developer Guide*.
    #
    # * Tags on the KMS key. To get this information, use ListResourceTags.
    #
    # * Key policies and grants on the KMS key. To get this information, use
    #   GetKeyPolicy and ListGrants.
    #
    # In general, `DescribeKey` is a non-mutating operation. It returns data
    # about KMS keys, but doesn't change them. However, Amazon Web Services
    # services use `DescribeKey` to create [Amazon Web Services managed
    # keys][2] from a *predefined Amazon Web Services alias* with no key ID.
    #
    # **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key
    # in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or
    # alias ARN in the value of the `KeyId` parameter.
    #
    # **Required permissions**: [kms:DescribeKey][4] (key policy)

    # @option params [required, String] :key_id
    #   Describes the specified KMS key.
    #
    #   If you specify a predefined Amazon Web Services alias (an Amazon Web
    #   Services alias with no key ID), KMS associates the alias with an
    #   [Amazon Web Services managed key][1] and returns its `KeyId` and `Arn`
    #   in the response.
    #
    #   To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
    #   ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with `"alias/"`. To specify a
    #   KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the
    #   key ARN or alias ARN.
    #
    #   For example:
    #
    #   * Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Key ARN:
    #     `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Alias name: `alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   * Alias ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or
    #   DescribeKey. To get the alias name and alias ARN, use ListAliases.

    # @option params [Array<String>] :grant_tokens

    #
    # @option params [Hash<String,String>] :encryption_context
    #   Specifies the encryption context that will be used to encrypt the

    #   asymmetric encryption algorithms and HMAC algorithms that KMS uses do
    #   not support an encryption context.
    #
    #   Do not include confidential or sensitive information in this field.
    #   This field may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other
    #   output.
    #
    #   An *encryption context* is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs
    #   that represent additional authenticated data. When you use an
    #   encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an
    #   exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An
    #   encryption context is supported only on operations with symmetric
    #   encryption KMS keys. On operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys,
    #   an encryption context is optional, but it is strongly recommended.

    #
    #   This parameter is required only for asymmetric KMS keys. The default

    # Returns a unique symmetric data key for use outside of KMS. This
    # operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key and a copy that is
    # encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key that you specify. The
    # bytes in the plaintext key are random; they are not related to the
    # caller or the KMS key. You can use the plaintext key to encrypt your
    # data outside of KMS and store the encrypted data key with the
    # encrypted data.
    #
    # To generate a data key, specify the symmetric encryption KMS key that
    # will be used to encrypt the data key. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS
    # key to encrypt data keys. To get the type of your KMS key, use the
    # DescribeKey operation.
    #
    # You must also specify the length of the data key. Use either the
    # `KeySpec` or `NumberOfBytes` parameters (but not both). For 128-bit
    # and 256-bit data keys, use the `KeySpec` parameter.
    #
    # To generate a 128-bit SM4 data key (China Regions only), specify a
    # `KeySpec` value of `AES_128` or a `NumberOfBytes` value of `16`. The
    # symmetric encryption key used in China Regions to encrypt your data
    # key is an SM4 encryption key.
    #
    # To get only an encrypted copy of the data key, use
    # GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext. To generate an asymmetric data key
    # pair, use the GenerateDataKeyPair or
    # GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext operation. To get a
    # cryptographically secure random byte string, use GenerateRandom.
    #
    # You can use an optional encryption context to add additional security
    # to the encryption operation. If you specify an `EncryptionContext`,
    # you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact
    # match) when decrypting the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request
    # to decrypt fails with an `InvalidCiphertextException`. For more
    # information, see [Encryption Context][1] in the *Key Management
    # Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # `GenerateDataKey` also supports [Amazon Web Services Nitro
    # Enclaves][2], which provide an isolated compute environment in Amazon
    # EC2. To call `GenerateDataKey` for an Amazon Web Services Nitro
    # enclave, use the [Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves SDK][3] or any
    # Amazon Web Services SDK. Use the `Recipient` parameter to provide the
    # attestation document for the enclave. `GenerateDataKey` returns a copy
    # of the data key encrypted under the specified KMS key, as usual. But
    # instead of a plaintext copy of the data key, the response includes a
    # copy of the data key encrypted under the public key from the
    # attestation document (`CiphertextForRecipient`). For information about
    # the interaction between KMS and Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves,
    # see [How Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves uses KMS][4] in the *Key
    # Management Service Developer Guide*..
    #
    # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible
    # key state. For details, see [Key states of KMS keys][5] in the *Key
    # Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # **How to use your data key**
    #
    # We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data
    # locally in your application. You can write your own code or use a
    # client-side encryption library, such as the [Amazon Web Services
    # Encryption SDK][6], the [Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client][7], or
    # [Amazon S3 client-side encryption][8] to do these tasks for you.
    #
    # To encrypt data outside of KMS:
    #
    # 1.  Use the `GenerateDataKey` operation to get a data key.
    #
    # 2.  Use the plaintext data key (in the `Plaintext` field of the
    #     response) to encrypt your data outside of KMS. Then erase the
    #     plaintext data key from memory.
    #
    # 3.  Store the encrypted data key (in the `CiphertextBlob` field of the
    #     response) with the encrypted data.
    #
    # To decrypt data outside of KMS:
    #
    # 1.  Use the Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted data key. The
    #     operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key.
    #
    # 2.  Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data outside of KMS, then
    #     erase the plaintext data key from memory.
    #
    # **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key
    # in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or
    # alias ARN in the value of the `KeyId` parameter.
    #

    #   128-bit (16-byte) and 256-bit (32-byte) data keys, use the `KeySpec`
    #   parameter.
    #
    #   You must specify either the `KeySpec` or the `NumberOfBytes` parameter
    #   (but not both) in every `GenerateDataKey` request.
    #
    # @option params [String] :key_spec
    #   Specifies the length of the data key. Use `AES_128` to generate a

    #   Web Services Nitro Enclaves SDK][2] or any Amazon Web Services SDK.
    #
    #   When you use this parameter, instead of returning the plaintext data
    #   key, KMS encrypts the plaintext data key under the public key in the
    #   attestation document, and returns the resulting ciphertext in the
    #   `CiphertextForRecipient` field in the response. This ciphertext can be
    #   decrypted only with the private key in the enclave. The

    #
    # `GenerateDataKeyPair` also supports [Amazon Web Services Nitro

    # EC2. To call `GenerateDataKeyPair` for an Amazon Web Services Nitro
    # enclave, use the [Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves SDK][4] or any

    #
    #   An *encryption context* is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs

    #   encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an
    #   exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An
    #   encryption context is supported only on operations with symmetric
    #   encryption KMS keys. On operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys,
    #   an encryption context is optional, but it is strongly recommended.

    #   a KMS key in a custom key store. To get the type and origin of your
    #   KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.
    #
    #   To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
    #   ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with `"alias/"`. To specify a
    #   KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the
    #   key ARN or alias ARN.
    #
    #   For example:
    #
    #   * Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Key ARN:

    #
    #   * Alias ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or

    #
    # @option params [required, String] :key_pair_spec
    #   Determines the type of data key pair that is generated.
    #
    #   The KMS rule that restricts the use of asymmetric RSA and SM2 KMS keys
    #   to encrypt and decrypt or to sign and verify (but not both), and the
    #   rule that permits you to use ECC KMS keys only to sign and verify, are

    #
    #   When you use this parameter, instead of returning a plaintext copy of
    #   the private data key, KMS encrypts the plaintext private data key
    #   under the public key in the attestation document, and returns the
    #   resulting ciphertext in the `CiphertextForRecipient` field in the
    #   response. This ciphertext can be decrypted only with the private key
    #   in the enclave. The `CiphertextBlob` field in the response contains a
    #   copy of the private data key encrypted under the KMS key specified by
    #   the `KeyId` parameter. The `PrivateKeyPlaintext` field in the response
    #   is null or empty.

    #   An *encryption context* is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs
    #   that represent additional authenticated data. When you use an
    #   encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an
    #   exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An
    #   encryption context is supported only on operations with symmetric
    #   encryption KMS keys. On operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys,
    #   an encryption context is optional, but it is strongly recommended.
    #
    #   For more information, see [Encryption context][1] in the *Key
    #   Management Service Developer Guide*.

    #
    # @option params [required, String] :key_id
    #   Specifies the symmetric encryption KMS key that encrypts the private
    #   key in the data key pair. You cannot specify an asymmetric KMS key or
    #   a KMS key in a custom key store. To get the type and origin of your
    #   KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.
    #
    #   To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
    #   ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with `"alias/"`. To specify a
    #   KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the
    #   key ARN or alias ARN.
    #
    #   For example:
    #
    #   * Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Key ARN:
    #     `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Alias name: `alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   * Alias ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or
    #   DescribeKey. To get the alias name and alias ARN, use ListAliases.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :key_pair_spec
    #   Determines the type of data key pair that is generated.
    #
    #   The KMS rule that restricts the use of asymmetric RSA and SM2 KMS keys
    #   to encrypt and decrypt or to sign and verify (but not both), and the
    #   rule that permits you to use ECC KMS keys only to sign and verify, are
    #   not effective on data key pairs, which are used outside of KMS. The
    #   SM2 key spec is only available in China Regions.
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :grant_tokens
    #   A list of grant tokens.
    #
    #   Use a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes

    # Returns a unique symmetric data key for use outside of KMS. This
    # operation returns a data key that is encrypted under a symmetric
    # encryption KMS key that you specify. The bytes in the key are random;
    # they are not related to the caller or to the KMS key.
    #
    # `GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext` is identical to the GenerateDataKey
    # operation except that it does not return a plaintext copy of the data
    # key.
    #
    # This operation is useful for systems that need to encrypt data at some
    # point, but not immediately. When you need to encrypt the data, you
    # call the Decrypt operation on the encrypted copy of the key.
    #
    # It's also useful in distributed systems with different levels of
    # trust. For example, you might store encrypted data in containers. One
    # component of your system creates new containers and stores an
    # encrypted data key with each container. Then, a different component
    # puts the data into the containers. That component first decrypts the
    # data key, uses the plaintext data key to encrypt data, puts the
    # encrypted data into the container, and then destroys the plaintext
    # data key. In this system, the component that creates the containers
    # never sees the plaintext data key.
    #
    # To request an asymmetric data key pair, use the GenerateDataKeyPair or
    # GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext operations.
    #
    # To generate a data key, you must specify the symmetric encryption KMS
    # key that is used to encrypt the data key. You cannot use an asymmetric
    # KMS key or a key in a custom key store to generate a data key. To get
    # the type of your KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.
    #
    # You must also specify the length of the data key. Use either the
    # `KeySpec` or `NumberOfBytes` parameters (but not both). For 128-bit
    # and 256-bit data keys, use the `KeySpec` parameter.
    #
    # To generate an SM4 data key (China Regions only), specify a `KeySpec`
    # value of `AES_128` or `NumberOfBytes` value of `16`. The symmetric
    # encryption key used in China Regions to encrypt your data key is an
    # SM4 encryption key.
    #
    # If the operation succeeds, you will find the encrypted copy of the
    # data key in the `CiphertextBlob` field.
    #
    # You can use an optional encryption context to add additional security
    # to the encryption operation. If you specify an `EncryptionContext`,
    # you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact
    # match) when decrypting the encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request
    # to decrypt fails with an `InvalidCiphertextException`. For more
    # information, see [Encryption Context][1] in the *Key Management
    # Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible
    # key state. For details, see [Key states of KMS keys][2] in the *Key
    # Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key
    # in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or

    # Gets a Boolean value that indicates whether [automatic rotation of the

    # When you enable automatic rotation for [customer managed KMS keys][2],

    # 365 days) from the enable date and every year thereafter. You can
    # monitor rotation of the key material for your KMS keys in CloudTrail
    # and Amazon CloudWatch.
    #
    # Automatic key rotation is supported only on [symmetric encryption KMS
    # keys][3]. You cannot enable automatic rotation of [asymmetric KMS
    # keys][4], [HMAC KMS keys][5], KMS keys with [imported key

    # * Disabled: The key rotation status does not change when you disable a
    #   KMS key. However, while the KMS key is disabled, KMS does not rotate
    #   the key material. When you re-enable the KMS key, rotation resumes.
    #   If the key material in the re-enabled KMS key hasn't been rotated
    #   in one year, KMS rotates it immediately, and every year thereafter.

    #   rotation schedule.

    #
    #   For RSA\_AES wrapping algorithms, you encrypt your key material with

    #
    #   The wrapping algorithms that you can use depend on the type of key
    #   material that you are importing. To import an RSA private key, you
    #   must use an RSA\_AES wrapping algorithm.

    # Returns the public key of an asymmetric KMS key. Unlike the private
    # key of a asymmetric KMS key, which never leaves KMS unencrypted,
    # callers with `kms:GetPublicKey` permission can download the public key
    # of an asymmetric KMS key. You can share the public key to allow others
    # to encrypt messages and verify signatures outside of KMS. For
    # information about asymmetric KMS keys, see [Asymmetric KMS keys][1] in
    # the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # You do not need to download the public key. Instead, you can use the
    # public key within KMS by calling the Encrypt, ReEncrypt, or Verify
    # operations with the identifier of an asymmetric KMS key. When you use
    # the public key within KMS, you benefit from the authentication,
    # authorization, and logging that are part of every KMS operation. You
    # also reduce of risk of encrypting data that cannot be decrypted. These
    # features are not effective outside of KMS.
    #
    # To help you use the public key safely outside of KMS, `GetPublicKey`
    # returns important information about the public key in the response,
    # including:
    #
    # * [KeySpec][2]: The type of key material in the public key, such as
    #   `RSA_4096` or `ECC_NIST_P521`.
    #
    # * [KeyUsage][3]: Whether the key is used for encryption or signing.
    #
    # * [EncryptionAlgorithms][4] or [SigningAlgorithms][5]: A list of the
    #   encryption algorithms or the signing algorithms for the key.
    #
    # Although KMS cannot enforce these restrictions on external operations,
    # it is crucial that you use this information to prevent the public key
    # from being used improperly. For example, you can prevent a public
    # signing key from being used encrypt data, or prevent a public key from
    # being used with an encryption algorithm that is not supported by KMS.
    # You can also avoid errors, such as using the wrong signing algorithm
    # in a verification operation.
    #
    # To verify a signature outside of KMS with an SM2 public key (China
    # Regions only), you must specify the distinguishing ID. By default, KMS
    # uses `1234567812345678` as the distinguishing ID. For more
    # information, see [Offline verification with SM2 key pairs][6].
    #
    # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible
    # key state. For details, see [Key states of KMS keys][7] in the *Key
    # Management Service Developer Guide*.

    # * Create or identify a KMS key with no key material. The KMS key must
    #   have an `Origin` value of `EXTERNAL`, which indicates that the KMS
    #   key is designed for imported key material.
    #
    #   To create an new KMS key for imported key material, call the
    #   CreateKey operation with an `Origin` value of `EXTERNAL`. You can
    #   create a symmetric encryption KMS key, HMAC KMS key, asymmetric
    #   encryption KMS key, or asymmetric signing KMS key. You can also
    #   import key material into a [multi-Region
    #   key](kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) of
    #   any supported type. However, you can't import key material into a

    #
    # * Use the DescribeKey operation to verify that the `KeyState` of the
    #   KMS key is `PendingImport`, which indicates that the KMS key has no
    #   key material.
    #
    #   If you are reimporting the same key material into an existing KMS
    #   key, you might need to call the DeleteImportedKeyMaterial to delete
    #   its existing key material.
    #
    # * Call the GetParametersForImport operation to get a public key and
    #   import token set for importing key material.
    #
    # * Use the public key in the GetParametersForImport response to encrypt
    #   your key material.
    #
    # Then, in an `ImportKeyMaterial` request, you submit your encrypted key
    # material and import token. When calling this operation, you must
    # specify the following values:
    #
    # * The key ID or key ARN of the KMS key to associate with the imported
    #   key material. Its `Origin` must be `EXTERNAL` and its `KeyState`
    #   must be `PendingImport`. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS
    #   key in a [custom key
    #   store](kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html), or
    #   on a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account. To get the
    #   `Origin` and `KeyState` of a KMS key, call DescribeKey.
    #
    # * The encrypted key material.
    #
    # * The import token that GetParametersForImport returned. You must use
    #   a public key and token from the same `GetParametersForImport`
    #   response.
    #
    # * Whether the key material expires (`ExpirationModel`) and, if so,
    #   when (`ValidTo`). For help with this choice, see [Setting an
    #   expiration time][3] in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   If you set an expiration date, KMS deletes the key material from the
    #   KMS key on the specified date, making the KMS key unusable. To use
    #   the KMS key in cryptographic operations again, you must reimport the
    #   same key material. However, you can delete and reimport the key
    #   material at any time, including before the key material expires.
    #   Each time you reimport, you can eliminate or reset the expiration
    #   time.
    #
    # When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key
    # changes from `PendingImport` to `Enabled`, and you can use the KMS key
    # in cryptographic operations.
    #
    # If this operation fails, use the exception to help determine the
    # problem. If the error is related to the key material, the import
    # token, or wrapping key, use GetParametersForImport to get a new public
    # key and import token for the KMS key and repeat the import procedure.
    # For help, see [How To Import Key Material][4] in the *Key Management
    # Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible
    # key state. For details, see [Key states of KMS keys][5] in the *Key
    # Management Service Developer Guide*.

    #   contained the public key that you used to encrypt the key material.
    #
    # @option params [required, String, StringIO, File] :encrypted_key_material

    #
    #   You cannot change the `ExpirationModel` or `ValidTo` values for the

    #
    # @option params [required, String] :policy
    #   The key policy to attach to the KMS key.
    #
    #   The key policy must meet the following criteria:
    #
    #   * The key policy must allow the calling principal to make a subsequent

    #     key policy][1] in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*. (To
    #     omit this condition, set `BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck` to true.)
    #
    #   * Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more
    #     principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be
    #     visible to KMS. When you create a new Amazon Web Services principal,
    #     you might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal
    #     in a key policy because the new principal might not be immediately
    #     visible to KMS. For more information, see [Changes that I make are

    #
    #   * Printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
    #     character set (through `\u00FF`).

    # Decrypts ciphertext and then reencrypts it entirely within KMS. You
    # can use this operation to change the KMS key under which data is
    # encrypted, such as when you [manually rotate][1] a KMS key or change
    # the KMS key that protects a ciphertext. You can also use it to
    # reencrypt ciphertext under the same KMS key, such as to change the
    # [encryption context][2] of a ciphertext.
    #
    # The `ReEncrypt` operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by
    # using a KMS key in an KMS operation, such as Encrypt or
    # GenerateDataKey. It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by
    # using the public key of an [asymmetric KMS key][3] outside of KMS.
    # However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries,
    # such as the [Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK][4] or [Amazon S3
    # client-side encryption][5]. These libraries return a ciphertext format
    # that is incompatible with KMS.
    #
    # When you use the `ReEncrypt` operation, you need to provide
    # information for the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt
    # operation.
    #
    # * If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS key, you
    #   must use the `SourceKeyId` parameter to identify the KMS key that
    #   encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption
    #   algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the
    #   data.
    #
    # * If your ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS
    #   key, the `SourceKeyId` parameter is optional. KMS can get this
    #   information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext
    #   blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by
    #   ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after
    #   it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the key ID.
    #   However, specifying the source KMS key is always recommended as a
    #   best practice. When you use the `SourceKeyId` parameter to specify a
    #   KMS key, KMS uses only the KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext
    #   was encrypted under a different KMS key, the `ReEncrypt` operation
    #   fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you
    #   intend.
    #
    # * To reencrypt the data, you must use the `DestinationKeyId` parameter
    #   to specify the KMS key that re-encrypts the data after it is
    #   decrypted. If the destination KMS key is an asymmetric KMS key, you
    #   must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you
    #   choose must be compatible with the KMS key.
    #
    #   When you use an asymmetric KMS key to encrypt or reencrypt data, be
    #   sure to record the KMS key and encryption algorithm that you choose.
    #   You will be required to provide the same KMS key and encryption
    #   algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the KMS key and algorithm do
    #   not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation
    #   fails.
    #
    #    You are not required to supply the key ID and encryption algorithm
    #   when you decrypt with symmetric encryption KMS keys because KMS
    #   stores this information in the ciphertext blob. KMS cannot store
    #   metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard
    #   format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable
    #   fields.
    #
    # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible
    # key state. For details, see [Key states of KMS keys][6] in the *Key
    # Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # **Cross-account use**: Yes. The source KMS key and destination KMS key
    # can be in different Amazon Web Services accounts. Either or both KMS
    # keys can be in a different account than the caller. To specify a KMS
    # key in a different account, you must use its key ARN or alias ARN.
    #
    # **Required permissions**:
    #
    # * [kms:ReEncryptFrom][7] permission on the source KMS key (key policy)
    #
    # * [kms:ReEncryptTo][7] permission on the destination KMS key (key
    #   policy)
    #
    # To permit reencryption from or to a KMS key, include the
    # `"kms:ReEncrypt*"` permission in your [key policy][8]. This permission
    # is automatically included in the key policy when you use the console
    # to create a KMS key. But you must include it manually when you create
    # a KMS key programmatically or when you use the PutKeyPolicy operation
    # to set a key policy.

    #   This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted
    #   under an asymmetric KMS key. If you used a symmetric encryption KMS
    #   key, KMS can get the KMS key from metadata that it adds to the
    #   symmetric ciphertext blob. However, it is always recommended as a best
    #   practice. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you
    #   intend.
    #
    #   To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
    #   ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with `"alias/"`. To specify a
    #   KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the
    #   key ARN or alias ARN.
    #
    #   For example:
    #
    #   * Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Key ARN:
    #     `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Alias name: `alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   * Alias ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or
    #   DescribeKey. To get the alias name and alias ARN, use ListAliases.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :destination_key_id
    #   A unique identifier for the KMS key that is used to reencrypt the
    #   data. Specify a symmetric encryption KMS key or an asymmetric KMS key
    #   with a `KeyUsage` value of `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`. To find the `KeyUsage`
    #   value of a KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.
    #
    #   To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
    #   ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with `"alias/"`. To specify a
    #   KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the
    #   key ARN or alias ARN.
    #
    #   For example:
    #
    #   * Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Key ARN:
    #     `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Alias name: `alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   * Alias ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or
    #   DescribeKey. To get the alias name and alias ARN, use ListAliases.
    #
    # @option params [Hash<String,String>] :destination_encryption_context
    #   Specifies that encryption context to use when the reencrypting the
    #   data.
    #
    #   Do not include confidential or sensitive information in this field.
    #   This field may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other
    #   output.
    #
    #   A destination encryption context is valid only when the destination
    #   KMS key is a symmetric encryption KMS key. The standard ciphertext
    #   format for asymmetric KMS keys does not include fields for metadata.
    #
    #   An *encryption context* is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs
    #   that represent additional authenticated data. When you use an
    #   encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an
    #   exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An
    #   encryption context is supported only on operations with symmetric
    #   encryption KMS keys. On operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys,
    #   an encryption context is optional, but it is strongly recommended.
    #
    #   For more information, see [Encryption context][1] in the *Key
    #   Management Service Developer Guide*.

    #   `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, represents the algorithm used for symmetric
    #   encryption KMS keys.
    #
    #   Specify the same algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. If
    #   you specify a different algorithm, the decrypt attempt fails.
    #
    #   This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted
    #   under an asymmetric KMS key.
    #
    # @option params [String] :destination_encryption_algorithm
    #   Specifies the encryption algorithm that KMS will use to reecrypt the

    #   symmetric encryption KMS keys.
    #
    #   This parameter is required only when the destination KMS key is an
    #   asymmetric KMS key.
    #

    # Replicates a multi-Region key into the specified Region. This
    # operation creates a multi-Region replica key based on a multi-Region
    # primary key in a different Region of the same Amazon Web Services
    # partition. You can create multiple replicas of a primary key, but each
    # must be in a different Region. To create a multi-Region primary key,
    # use the CreateKey operation.
    #
    # This operation supports *multi-Region keys*, an KMS feature that lets
    # you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web
    # Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key
    # material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to
    # encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a
    # different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or
    # making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region
    # keys, see [Multi-Region keys in KMS][1] in the *Key Management Service
    # Developer Guide*.
    #
    # A *replica key* is a fully-functional KMS key that can be used
    # independently of its primary and peer replica keys. A primary key and
    # its replica keys share properties that make them interoperable. They
    # have the same [key ID][2] and key material. They also have the same
    # [key spec][3], [key usage][4], [key material origin][5], and
    # [automatic key rotation status][6]. KMS automatically synchronizes
    # these shared properties among related multi-Region keys. All other
    # properties of a replica key can differ, including its [key policy][7],
    # [tags][8], [aliases][9], and [Key states of KMS keys][10]. KMS pricing
    # and quotas for KMS keys apply to each primary key and replica key.
    #
    # When this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient key
    # state of `Creating`. This key state changes to `Enabled` (or
    # `PendingImport`) after a few seconds when the process of creating the
    # new replica key is complete. While the key state is `Creating`, you
    # can manage key, but you cannot yet use it in cryptographic operations.
    # If you are creating and using the replica key programmatically, retry
    # on `KMSInvalidStateException` or call `DescribeKey` to check its
    # `KeyState` value before using it. For details about the `Creating` key
    # state, see [Key states of KMS keys][10] in the *Key Management Service
    # Developer Guide*.
    #
    # You cannot create more than one replica of a primary key in any
    # Region. If the Region already includes a replica of the key you're
    # trying to replicate, `ReplicateKey` returns an
    # `AlreadyExistsException` error. If the key state of the existing
    # replica is `PendingDeletion`, you can cancel the scheduled key
    # deletion (CancelKeyDeletion) or wait for the key to be deleted. The
    # new replica key you create will have the same [shared properties][11]
    # as the original replica key.
    #
    # The CloudTrail log of a `ReplicateKey` operation records a
    # `ReplicateKey` operation in the primary key's Region and a CreateKey
    # operation in the replica key's Region.
    #
    # If you replicate a multi-Region primary key with imported key
    # material, the replica key is created with no key material. You must
    # import the same key material that you imported into the primary key.
    # For details, see [Importing key material into multi-Region
    # keys](kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-import.html) in the
    # *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # To convert a replica key to a primary key, use the UpdatePrimaryRegion
    # operation.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> `ReplicateKey` uses different default values for the `KeyPolicy` and
    # `Tags` parameters than those used in the KMS console. For details, see
    # the parameter descriptions.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # **Cross-account use**: No. You cannot use this operation to create a
    # replica key in a different Amazon Web Services account.
    #
    # **Required permissions**:
    #
    # * `kms:ReplicateKey` on the primary key (in the primary key's

    #
    # * `kms:CreateKey` in an IAM policy in the replica Region.

    # @option params [String] :policy
    #   The key policy to attach to the KMS key. This parameter is optional.
    #   If you do not provide a key policy, KMS attaches the [default key
    #   policy][1] to the KMS key.
    #
    #   The key policy is not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can
    #   specify the same key policy or a different key policy for each key in
    #   a set of related multi-Region keys. KMS does not synchronize this
    #   property.
    #
    #   If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:
    #
    #   * The key policy must allow the calling principal to make a subsequent
    #     `PutKeyPolicy` request on the KMS key. This reduces the risk that
    #     the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For more information, see [Default
    #     key policy][2] in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*. (To
    #     omit this condition, set `BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck` to true.)
    #
    #   * Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more
    #     principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be
    #     visible to KMS. When you create a new Amazon Web Services principal,
    #     you might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal
    #     in a key policy because the new principal might not be immediately
    #     visible to KMS. For more information, see [Changes that I make are
    #     not always immediately visible][3] in the *Amazon Web Services
    #     Identity and Access Management User Guide*.
    #
    #   A key policy document can include only the following characters:
    #
    #   * Printable ASCII characters from the space character (`\u0020`)
    #     through the end of the ASCII character range.
    #
    #   * Printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
    #     character set (through `\u00FF`).
    #
    #   * The tab (`\u0009`), line feed (`\u000A`), and carriage return
    #     (`\u000D`) special characters

    #   string. You cannot have more than one tag on a KMS key with the same
    #   tag key. If you specify an existing tag key with a different tag
    #   value, KMS replaces the current tag value with the specified one.
    #
    #   When you add tags to an Amazon Web Services resource, Amazon Web
    #   Services generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs
    #   aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS
    #   key. For details, see [Tagging Keys][3].

    # Deletes a grant. Typically, you retire a grant when you no longer need
    # its permissions. To identify the grant to retire, use a [grant

    # ARN) of the KMS key. The CreateGrant operation returns both values.
    #
    # This operation can be called by the *retiring principal* for a grant,
    # by the *grantee principal* if the grant allows the `RetireGrant`
    # operation, and by the Amazon Web Services account in which the grant
    # is created. It can also be called by principals to whom permission for
    # retiring a grant is delegated. For details, see [Retiring and revoking

    # Schedules the deletion of a KMS key. By default, KMS applies a waiting
    # period of 30 days, but you can specify a waiting period of 7-30 days.
    # When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key
    # changes to `PendingDeletion` and the key can't be used in any
    # cryptographic operations. It remains in this state for the duration of
    # the waiting period. Before the waiting period ends, you can use
    # CancelKeyDeletion to cancel the deletion of the KMS key. After the
    # waiting period ends, KMS deletes the KMS key, its key material, and
    # all KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to
    # it.
    #
    # Deleting a KMS key is a destructive and potentially dangerous
    # operation. When a KMS key is deleted, all data that was encrypted
    # under the KMS key is unrecoverable. (The only exception is a
    # [multi-Region replica
    # key](kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-delete.html), or an
    # [asymmetric or HMAC KMS key with imported key
    # material](kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys-managing.html#import-delete-key).)
    # To prevent the use of a KMS key without deleting it, use DisableKey.
    #
    # You can schedule the deletion of a multi-Region primary key and its
    # replica keys at any time. However, KMS will not delete a multi-Region
    # primary key with existing replica keys. If you schedule the deletion
    # of a primary key with replicas, its key state changes to
    # `PendingReplicaDeletion` and it cannot be replicated or used in
    # cryptographic operations. This status can continue indefinitely. When
    # the last of its replicas keys is deleted (not just scheduled), the key
    # state of the primary key changes to `PendingDeletion` and its waiting
    # period (`PendingWindowInDays`) begins. For details, see [Deleting
    # multi-Region keys][1] in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # When KMS [deletes a KMS key from an CloudHSM key store][2], it makes a
    # best effort to delete the associated key material from the associated
    # CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need to manually [delete the
    # orphaned key material][3] from the cluster and its backups. [Deleting
    # a KMS key from an external key store][4] has no effect on the
    # associated external key. However, for both types of custom key stores,
    # deleting a KMS key is destructive and irreversible. You cannot decrypt
    # ciphertext encrypted under the KMS key by using only its associated
    # external key or CloudHSM key. Also, you cannot recreate a KMS key in
    # an external key store by creating a new KMS key with the same key
    # material.
    #
    # For more information about scheduling a KMS key for deletion, see
    # [Deleting KMS keys][5] in the *Key Management Service Developer
    # Guide*.
    #
    # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible

    # Creates a [digital signature][1] for a message or message digest by
    # using the private key in an asymmetric signing KMS key. To verify the
    # signature, use the Verify operation, or use the public key in the same
    # asymmetric KMS key outside of KMS. For information about asymmetric
    # KMS keys, see [Asymmetric KMS keys][2] in the *Key Management Service
    # Developer Guide*.
    #
    # Digital signatures are generated and verified by using asymmetric key
    # pair, such as an RSA or ECC pair that is represented by an asymmetric
    # KMS key. The key owner (or an authorized user) uses their private key
    # to sign a message. Anyone with the public key can verify that the
    # message was signed with that particular private key and that the
    # message hasn't changed since it was signed.
    #
    # To use the `Sign` operation, provide the following information:
    #
    # * Use the `KeyId` parameter to identify an asymmetric KMS key with a
    #   `KeyUsage` value of `SIGN_VERIFY`. To get the `KeyUsage` value of a
    #   KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation. The caller must have
    #   `kms:Sign` permission on the KMS key.
    #
    # * Use the `Message` parameter to specify the message or message digest
    #   to sign. You can submit messages of up to 4096 bytes. To sign a
    #   larger message, generate a hash digest of the message, and then
    #   provide the hash digest in the `Message` parameter. To indicate
    #   whether the message is a full message or a digest, use the
    #   `MessageType` parameter.
    #
    # * Choose a signing algorithm that is compatible with the KMS key.
    #
    # When signing a message, be sure to record the KMS key and the signing
    # algorithm. This information is required to verify the signature.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> Best practices recommend that you limit the time during which any
    # signature is effective. This deters an attack where the actor uses a
    # signed message to establish validity repeatedly or long after the
    # message is superseded. Signatures do not include a timestamp, but you
    # can include a timestamp in the signed message to help you detect when
    # its time to refresh the signature.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # To verify the signature that this operation generates, use the Verify
    # operation. Or use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public
    # key and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of
    # KMS.
    #
    # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible
    # key state. For details, see [Key states of KMS keys][3] in the *Key
    # Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key
    # in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or
    # alias ARN in the value of the `KeyId` parameter.

    #
    # @option params [required, String] :key_id
    #   Identifies an asymmetric KMS key. KMS uses the private key in the
    #   asymmetric KMS key to sign the message. The `KeyUsage` type of the KMS
    #   key must be `SIGN_VERIFY`. To find the `KeyUsage` of a KMS key, use
    #   the DescribeKey operation.
    #
    #   To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
    #   ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with `"alias/"`. To specify a
    #   KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the
    #   key ARN or alias ARN.
    #
    #   For example:
    #
    #   * Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Key ARN:
    #     `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Alias name: `alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   * Alias ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or
    #   DescribeKey. To get the alias name and alias ARN, use ListAliases.
    #
    # @option params [required, String, StringIO, File] :message
    #   Specifies the message or message digest to sign. Messages can be
    #   0-4096 bytes. To sign a larger message, provide a message digest.
    #
    #   If you provide a message digest, use the `DIGEST` value of
    #   `MessageType` to prevent the digest from being hashed again while
    #   signing.
    #
    # @option params [String] :message_type
    #   Tells KMS whether the value of the `Message` parameter should be
    #   hashed as part of the signing algorithm. Use `RAW` for unhashed
    #   messages; use `DIGEST` for message digests, which are already hashed.
    #
    #   When the value of `MessageType` is `RAW`, KMS uses the standard
    #   signing algorithm, which begins with a hash function. When the value
    #   is `DIGEST`, KMS skips the hashing step in the signing algorithm.
    #
    #   Use the `DIGEST` value only when the value of the `Message` parameter
    #   is a message digest. If you use the `DIGEST` value with an unhashed
    #   message, the security of the signing operation can be compromised.
    #
    #   When the value of `MessageType`is `DIGEST`, the length of the
    #   `Message` value must match the length of hashed messages for the
    #   specified signing algorithm.
    #
    #   You can submit a message digest and omit the `MessageType` or specify
    #   `RAW` so the digest is hashed again while signing. However, this can
    #   cause verification failures when verifying with a system that assumes
    #   a single hash.
    #
    #   The hashing algorithm in that `Sign` uses is based on the
    #   `SigningAlgorithm` value.
    #
    #   * Signing algorithms that end in SHA\_256 use the SHA\_256 hashing
    #     algorithm.
    #
    #   * Signing algorithms that end in SHA\_384 use the SHA\_384 hashing
    #     algorithm.
    #
    #   * Signing algorithms that end in SHA\_512 use the SHA\_512 hashing
    #     algorithm.
    #
    #   * SM2DSA uses the SM3 hashing algorithm. For details, see [Offline
    #     verification with SM2 key pairs][1].

    # Use the required `CustomKeyStoreId` parameter to identify the custom
    # key store. Use the remaining optional parameters to change its
    # properties. This operation does not return any property values. To
    # verify the updated property values, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores
    # operation.
    #
    # This operation is part of the [custom key stores][1] feature in KMS,
    # which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with
    # the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage.
    #
    # When updating the properties of an external key store, verify that the
    # updated settings connect your key store, via the external key store
    # proxy, to the same external key manager as the previous settings, or
    # to a backup or snapshot of the external key manager with the same
    # cryptographic keys. If the updated connection settings fail, you can
    # fix them and retry, although an extended delay might disrupt Amazon
    # Web Services services. However, if KMS permanently loses its access to
    # cryptographic keys, ciphertext encrypted under those keys is
    # unrecoverable.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> For external key stores:
    #
    #  Some external key managers provide a simpler method for updating an
    # external key store. For details, see your external key manager
    # documentation.
    #
    #  When updating an external key store in the KMS console, you can upload
    # a JSON-based proxy configuration file with the desired values. You
    # cannot upload the proxy configuration file to the
    # `UpdateCustomKeyStore` operation. However, you can use the file to
    # help you determine the correct values for the `UpdateCustomKeyStore`
    # parameters.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # For an CloudHSM key store, you can use this operation to change the
    # custom key store friendly name (`NewCustomKeyStoreName`), to tell KMS
    # about a change to the `kmsuser` crypto user password
    # (`KeyStorePassword`), or to associate the custom key store with a
    # different, but related, CloudHSM cluster (`CloudHsmClusterId`). To
    # update any property of an CloudHSM key store, the `ConnectionState` of
    # the CloudHSM key store must be `DISCONNECTED`.
    #
    # For an external key store, you can use this operation to change the
    # custom key store friendly name (`NewCustomKeyStoreName`), or to tell
    # KMS about a change to the external key store proxy authentication
    # credentials (`XksProxyAuthenticationCredential`), connection method
    # (`XksProxyConnectivity`), external proxy endpoint
    # (`XksProxyUriEndpoint`) and path (`XksProxyUriPath`). For external key
    # stores with an `XksProxyConnectivity` of `VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE`, you
    # can also update the Amazon VPC endpoint service name
    # (`XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName`). To update most properties of an
    # external key store, the `ConnectionState` of the external key store
    # must be `DISCONNECTED`. However, you can update the
    # `CustomKeyStoreName`, `XksProxyAuthenticationCredential`, and
    # `XksProxyUriPath` of an external key store when it is in the CONNECTED
    # or DISCONNECTED state.
    #
    # If your update requires a `DISCONNECTED` state, before using
    # `UpdateCustomKeyStore`, use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to
    # disconnect the custom key store. After the `UpdateCustomKeyStore`
    # operation completes, use the ConnectCustomKeyStore to reconnect the
    # custom key store. To find the `ConnectionState` of the custom key
    # store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.
    #
    #
    #
    # Before updating the custom key store, verify that the new values allow
    # KMS to connect the custom key store to its backing key store. For
    # example, before you change the `XksProxyUriPath` value, verify that
    # the external key store proxy is reachable at the new path.
    #
    # If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no

    #   You can include an optional prefix between the required elements such
    #   as `/example/kms/xks/v1`.
    #
    #   The combined `XksProxyUriEndpoint` and `XksProxyUriPath` values must
    #   be unique in the Amazon Web Services account and Region.

    #   You can change this value when the external key store is connected or
    #   disconnected.
    #
    # @option params [String] :xks_proxy_vpc_endpoint_service_name
    #   Changes the name that KMS uses to identify the Amazon VPC endpoint
    #   service for your external key store proxy (XKS proxy). This parameter

    #   You must specify both the `AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey` value in
    #   the authentication credential, even if you are only updating one
    #   value.
    #
    #   This parameter doesn't establish or change your authentication
    #   credentials on the proxy. It just tells KMS the credential that you
    #   established with your external key store proxy. For example, if you
    #   rotate the credential on your external key store proxy, you can use
    #   this parameter to update the credential in KMS.

    # Changes the primary key of a multi-Region key.
    #
    # This operation changes the replica key in the specified Region to a
    # primary key and changes the former primary key to a replica key. For
    # example, suppose you have a primary key in `us-east-1` and a replica
    # key in `eu-west-2`. If you run `UpdatePrimaryRegion` with a
    # `PrimaryRegion` value of `eu-west-2`, the primary key is now the key
    # in `eu-west-2`, and the key in `us-east-1` becomes a replica key. For
    # details, see [Updating the primary Region][1] in the *Key Management
    # Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # This operation supports *multi-Region keys*, an KMS feature that lets
    # you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web
    # Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key
    # material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to
    # encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a
    # different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or
    # making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region
    # keys, see [Multi-Region keys in KMS][2] in the *Key Management Service
    # Developer Guide*.
    #
    # The *primary key* of a multi-Region key is the source for properties
    # that are always shared by primary and replica keys, including the key
    # material, [key ID][3], [key spec][4], [key usage][5], [key material
    # origin][6], and [automatic key rotation][7]. It's the only key that
    # can be replicated. You cannot [delete the primary key][8] until all
    # replica keys are deleted.
    #
    # The key ID and primary Region that you specify uniquely identify the
    # replica key that will become the primary key. The primary Region must
    # already have a replica key. This operation does not create a KMS key
    # in the specified Region. To find the replica keys, use the DescribeKey
    # operation on the primary key or any replica key. To create a replica
    # key, use the ReplicateKey operation.
    #
    # You can run this operation while using the affected multi-Region keys
    # in cryptographic operations. This operation should not delay,
    # interrupt, or cause failures in cryptographic operations.
    #
    # Even after this operation completes, the process of updating the
    # primary Region might still be in progress for a few more seconds.
    # Operations such as `DescribeKey` might display both the old and new
    # primary keys as replicas. The old and new primary keys have a
    # transient key state of `Updating`. The original key state is restored
    # when the update is complete. While the key state is `Updating`, you
    # can use the keys in cryptographic operations, but you cannot replicate
    # the new primary key or perform certain management operations, such as
    # enabling or disabling these keys. For details about the `Updating` key
    # state, see [Key states of KMS keys][9] in the *Key Management Service

    # Verifies a digital signature that was generated by the Sign operation.
    #
    #
    #
    # Verification confirms that an authorized user signed the message with
    # the specified KMS key and signing algorithm, and the message hasn't
    # changed since it was signed. If the signature is verified, the value
    # of the `SignatureValid` field in the response is `True`. If the
    # signature verification fails, the `Verify` operation fails with an
    # `KMSInvalidSignatureException` exception.
    #
    # A digital signature is generated by using the private key in an
    # asymmetric KMS key. The signature is verified by using the public key
    # in the same asymmetric KMS key. For information about asymmetric KMS
    # keys, see [Asymmetric KMS keys][1] in the *Key Management Service
    # Developer Guide*.
    #
    # To use the `Verify` operation, specify the same asymmetric KMS key,
    # message, and signing algorithm that were used to produce the
    # signature. The message type does not need to be the same as the one
    # used for signing, but it must indicate whether the value of the
    # `Message` parameter should be hashed as part of the verification
    # process.
    #
    # You can also verify the digital signature by using the public key of
    # the KMS key outside of KMS. Use the GetPublicKey operation to download
    # the public key in the asymmetric KMS key and then use the public key
    # to verify the signature outside of KMS. The advantage of using the
    # `Verify` operation is that it is performed within KMS. As a result,
    # it's easy to call, the operation is performed within the FIPS
    # boundary, it is logged in CloudTrail, and you can use key policy and
    # IAM policy to determine who is authorized to use the KMS key to verify
    # signatures.
    #
    # To verify a signature outside of KMS with an SM2 public key (China
    # Regions only), you must specify the distinguishing ID. By default, KMS
    # uses `1234567812345678` as the distinguishing ID. For more
    # information, see [Offline verification with SM2 key pairs][2].
    #
    # The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible

    # @option params [required, String] :key_id
    #   Identifies the asymmetric KMS key that will be used to verify the
    #   signature. This must be the same KMS key that was used to generate the
    #   signature. If you specify a different KMS key, the signature
    #   verification fails.
    #
    #   To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
    #   ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with `"alias/"`. To specify a
    #   KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the
    #   key ARN or alias ARN.
    #
    #   For example:
    #
    #   * Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`
    #
    #   * Key ARN:

    #
    #   * Alias name: `alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   * Alias ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`
    #
    #   To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or
    #   DescribeKey. To get the alias name and alias ARN, use ListAliases.
    #
    # @option params [required, String, StringIO, File] :message
    #   Specifies the message that was signed. You can submit a raw message of
    #   up to 4096 bytes, or a hash digest of the message. If you submit a
    #   digest, use the `MessageType` parameter with a value of `DIGEST`.
    #
    #   If the message specified here is different from the message that was
    #   signed, the signature verification fails. A message and its hash
    #   digest are considered to be the same message.
    #
    # @option params [String] :message_type
    #   Tells KMS whether the value of the `Message` parameter should be
    #   hashed as part of the signing algorithm. Use `RAW` for unhashed
    #   messages; use `DIGEST` for message digests, which are already hashed.
    #
    #   When the value of `MessageType` is `RAW`, KMS uses the standard
    #   signing algorithm, which begins with a hash function. When the value
    #   is `DIGEST`, KMS skips the hashing step in the signing algorithm.
    #
    #   Use the `DIGEST` value only when the value of the `Message` parameter
    #   is a message digest. If you use the `DIGEST` value with an unhashed
    #   message, the security of the verification operation can be
    #   compromised.
    #
    #   When the value of `MessageType`is `DIGEST`, the length of the
    #   `Message` value must match the length of hashed messages for the
    #   specified signing algorithm.
    #
    #   You can submit a message digest and omit the `MessageType` or specify
    #   `RAW` so the digest is hashed again while signing. However, if the
    #   signed message is hashed once while signing, but twice while
    #   verifying, verification fails, even when the message hasn't changed.
    #
    #   The hashing algorithm in that `Verify` uses is based on the
    #   `SigningAlgorithm` value.
    #
    #   * Signing algorithms that end in SHA\_256 use the SHA\_256 hashing
    #     algorithm.
    #
    #   * Signing algorithms that end in SHA\_384 use the SHA\_384 hashing
    #     algorithm.
    #
    #   * Signing algorithms that end in SHA\_512 use the SHA\_512 hashing
    #     algorithm.
    #

    # Verifies the hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) for a
    # specified message, HMAC KMS key, and MAC algorithm. To verify the
    # HMAC, `VerifyMac` computes an HMAC using the message, HMAC KMS key,
    # and MAC algorithm that you specify, and compares the computed HMAC to
    # the HMAC that you specify. If the HMACs are identical, the
    # verification succeeds; otherwise, it fails. Verification indicates
    # that the message hasn't changed since the HMAC was calculated, and
    # the specified key was used to generate and verify the HMAC.
    #
    # HMAC KMS keys and the HMAC algorithms that KMS uses conform to
    # industry standards defined in [RFC 2104][1].
    #
    # This operation is part of KMS support for HMAC KMS keys. For details,
    # see [HMAC keys in KMS][2] in the *Key Management Service Developer
    # Guide*.
