    #   scaling policy to scale out an Amazon ECS service by 2 tasks, the

    #   scale out the service by 3 tasks, the 2 tasks that were added in the
    #   previous scale out event are considered part of that capacity and
    #   only 1 additional task is added to the desired count.
    #
    #   For scale in policies, the cooldown period is used to block
    #   subsequent scale in requests until it has expired. The intention is
    #   to scale in conservatively to protect your application's

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] scale_out_cooldown
    #   The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale out activity completes
    #   before another scale out activity can start.
    #
    #   While the cooldown period is in effect, the capacity that has been
    #   added by the previous scale out event that initiated the cooldown is
    #   calculated as part of the desired capacity for the next scale out.
    #   The intention is to continuously (but not excessively) scale out.
    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] scale_in_cooldown
    #   The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale in activity completes
    #   before another scale in activity can start.
    #
    #   The cooldown period is used to block subsequent scale in requests
    #   until it has expired. The intention is to scale in conservatively to
    #   protect your application's availability. However, if another alarm
    #   triggers a scale out policy during the cooldown period after a
    #   scale-in, Application Auto Scaling scales out your scalable target
    #   immediately.
    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] disable_scale_in
    #   Indicates whether scale in by the target tracking policy is
    #   disabled. If the value is `true`, scale in is disabled and the
    #   target tracking policy won't remove capacity from the scalable
    #   resource. Otherwise, scale in is enabled and the target tracking
    #   policy can remove capacity from the scalable resource. The default
    #   value is `false`.
    #   @return [Boolean]
