    #   Fully qualified domain name (FQDN), such as www.example.com, that
    #   you want to secure with an ACM certificate. Use an asterisk (*) to
    #   create a wildcard certificate that protects several sites in the
    #   same domain. For example, *.example.com protects www.example.com,
    #   site.example.com, and images.example.com.
    #
    #   In compliance with [RFC 5280][1], the length of the domain name
    #   (technically, the Common Name) that you provide cannot exceed 64
    #   octets (characters), including periods. To add a longer domain name,

    # @!attribute [rw] validation_method
    #   The method you want to use if you are requesting a public
    #   certificate to validate that you own or control domain. You can
    #   [validate with DNS][1] or [validate with email][2]. We recommend
    #   that you use DNS validation.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] subject_alternative_names
    #   Additional FQDNs to be included in the Subject Alternative Name
    #   extension of the ACM certificate. For example, add the name
    #   www.example.net to a certificate for which the `DomainName` field is
    #   www.example.com if users can reach your site by using either name.
    #   The maximum number of domain names that you can add to an ACM
    #   certificate is 100. However, the initial quota is 10 domain names.
    #   If you need more than 10 names, you must request a quota increase.
    #   For more information, see [Quotas][1].
    #
    #   The maximum length of a SAN DNS name is 253 octets. The name is made
    #   up of multiple labels separated by periods. No label can be longer
    #   than 63 octets. Consider the following examples:
    #
    #   * `(63 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(61 octets)` is legal because
    #     the total length is 253 octets (63+1+63+1+63+1+61) and no label
    #     exceeds 63 octets.
    #
    #   * `(64 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(61 octets)` is not legal
    #     because the total length exceeds 253 octets (64+1+63+1+63+1+61)
    #     and the first label exceeds 63 octets.
    #
    #   * `(63 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(62 octets)` is not legal
    #     because the total length of the DNS name (63+1+63+1+63+1+62)
    #     exceeds 253 octets.

    #   Customer chosen string that can be used to distinguish between calls
    #   to `RequestCertificate`. Idempotency tokens time out after one hour.
    #   Therefore, if you call `RequestCertificate` multiple times with the
    #   same idempotency token within one hour, ACM recognizes that you are
    #   requesting only one certificate and will issue only one. If you

    #   about private CAs, see the [Amazon Web Services Private Certificate

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] key_algorithm
    #   Specifies the algorithm of the public and private key pair that your
    #   certificate uses to encrypt data. RSA is the default key algorithm
    #   for ACM certificates. Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
    #   (ECDSA) keys are smaller, offering security comparable to RSA keys
    #   but with greater computing efficiency. However, ECDSA is not
    #   supported by all network clients. Some Amazon Web Services services
    #   may require RSA keys, or only support ECDSA keys of a particular
    #   size, while others allow the use of either RSA and ECDSA keys to
    #   ensure that compatibility is not broken. Check the requirements for
    #   the Amazon Web Services service where you plan to deploy your
    #   certificate. For more information about selecting an algorithm, see
    #   [Key algorithms][1].
