  # Scenario: Making a basic request
  #   When I call the "ListJobs" API
  #   Then the response should contain a list of "Jobs"

  # Scenario: Error handling
  #   When I attempt to call the "GetStatus" API with:
  #   | JobId | fake_job |
  #   Then I expect the response error code to be "InvalidJobIdException"
  #   And I expect the response error message to include:
  #   """
  #   No such job fake_job for your account
  #   """
