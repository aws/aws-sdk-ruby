    #   A list of the training parameters in the `MLModel`. The list is

    #
    #   The following is the current set of training parameters:
    #
    #   * `sgd.maxMLModelSizeInBytes` - The maximum allowed size of the
    #     model. Depending on the input data, the size of the model might
    #     affect its performance.
    #
    #     The value is an integer that ranges from `100000` to `2147483648`.
    #     The default value is `33554432`.
    #
    #   * `sgd.maxPasses` - The number of times that the training process
    #     traverses the observations to build the `MLModel`. The value is an
    #     integer that ranges from `1` to `10000`. The default value is
    #     `10`.
    #
    #   * `sgd.shuffleType` - Whether Amazon ML shuffles the training data.
    #     Shuffling the data improves a model's ability to find the optimal
    #     solution for a variety of data types. The valid values are `auto`
    #     and `none`. The default value is `none`. We <?oxy\_insert\_start
    #     author="laurama" timestamp="20160329T131121-0700">strongly
    #     recommend that you shuffle your data.<?oxy\_insert\_end>
    #
    #   * `sgd.l1RegularizationAmount` - The coefficient regularization L1
    #     norm. It controls overfitting the data by penalizing large
    #     coefficients. This tends to drive coefficients to zero, resulting
    #     in a sparse feature set. If you use this parameter, start by
    #     specifying a small value, such as `1.0E-08`.
    #
    #     The value is a double that ranges from `0` to `MAX_DOUBLE`. The
    #     default is to not use L1 normalization. This parameter can't be
    #     used when `L2` is specified. Use this parameter sparingly.
    #
    #   * `sgd.l2RegularizationAmount` - The coefficient regularization L2
    #     norm. It controls overfitting the data by penalizing large
    #     coefficients. This tends to drive coefficients to small, nonzero
    #     values. If you use this parameter, start by specifying a small
    #     value, such as `1.0E-08`.

    # Measurements of how well the `MLModel` performed on known
    # observations. One of the following metrics is returned, based on the
    # type of the `MLModel`\:
    #
    # * BinaryAUC: The binary `MLModel` uses the Area Under the Curve (AUC)
    #   technique to measure performance.
    #
    # * RegressionRMSE: The regression `MLModel` uses the Root Mean Square
    #   Error (RMSE) technique to measure performance. RMSE measures the
    #   difference between predicted and actual values for a single
    #   variable.
    #
    # * MulticlassAvgFScore: The multiclass `MLModel` uses the F1 score
    #   technique to measure performance.

    #   processing to be applied to a `DataSource`. If the
    #   `DataRearrangement` parameter is not provided, all of the input data
    #   is used to create the `Datasource`.
    #
    #   There are multiple parameters that control what data is used to
    #   create a datasource:
    #
    #   * **`percentBegin`**
    #
    #     Use `percentBegin` to indicate the beginning of the range of the
    #     data used to create the Datasource. If you do not include
    #     `percentBegin` and `percentEnd`, Amazon ML includes all of the
    #     data when creating the datasource.
    #
    #   * **`percentEnd`**
    #
    #     Use `percentEnd` to indicate the end of the range of the data used
    #     to create the Datasource. If you do not include `percentBegin` and
    #     `percentEnd`, Amazon ML includes all of the data when creating the
    #     datasource.
    #
    #   * **`complement`**
    #
    #     The `complement` parameter instructs Amazon ML to use the data
    #     that is not included in the range of `percentBegin` to
    #     `percentEnd` to create a datasource. The `complement` parameter is
    #     useful if you need to create complementary datasources for
    #     training and evaluation. To create a complementary datasource, use
    #     the same values for `percentBegin` and `percentEnd`, along with
    #     the `complement` parameter.
    #
    #     For example, the following two datasources do not share any data,
    #     and can be used to train and evaluate a model. The first
    #     datasource has 25 percent of the data, and the second one has 75
    #     percent of the data.
    #
    #     Datasource for evaluation: `\{"splitting":\{"percentBegin":0,
    #     "percentEnd":25\}\}`
    #
    #     Datasource for training: `\{"splitting":\{"percentBegin":0,
    #     "percentEnd":25, "complement":"true"\}\}`
    #
    #   * **`strategy`**
    #
    #     To change how Amazon ML splits the data for a datasource, use the
    #     `strategy` parameter.
    #
    #     The default value for the `strategy` parameter is `sequential`,
    #     meaning that Amazon ML takes all of the data records between the
    #     `percentBegin` and `percentEnd` parameters for the datasource, in
    #     the order that the records appear in the input data.
    #
    #     The following two `DataRearrangement` lines are examples of
    #     sequentially ordered training and evaluation datasources:
    #
    #     Datasource for evaluation: `\{"splitting":\{"percentBegin":70,
    #     "percentEnd":100, "strategy":"sequential"\}\}`
    #
    #     Datasource for training: `\{"splitting":\{"percentBegin":70,
    #     "percentEnd":100, "strategy":"sequential",
    #     "complement":"true"\}\}`
    #
    #     To randomly split the input data into the proportions indicated by
    #     the percentBegin and percentEnd parameters, set the `strategy`
    #     parameter to `random` and provide a string that is used as the
    #     seed value for the random data splitting (for example, you can use
    #     the S3 path to your data as the random seed string). If you choose
    #     the random split strategy, Amazon ML assigns each row of data a
    #     pseudo-random number between 0 and 100, and then selects the rows
    #     that have an assigned number between `percentBegin` and
    #     `percentEnd`. Pseudo-random numbers are assigned using both the
    #     input seed string value and the byte offset as a seed, so changing
    #     the data results in a different split. Any existing ordering is
    #     preserved. The random splitting strategy ensures that variables in
    #     the training and evaluation data are distributed similarly. It is
    #     useful in the cases where the input data may have an implicit sort
    #     order, which would otherwise result in training and evaluation
    #     datasources containing non-similar data records.
    #
    #     The following two `DataRearrangement` lines are examples of
    #     non-sequentially ordered training and evaluation datasources:
    #
    #     Datasource for evaluation: `\{"splitting":\{"percentBegin":70,
    #     "percentEnd":100, "strategy":"random",
    #     "randomSeed"="s3://my_s3_path/bucket/file.csv"\}\}`
    #
    #     Datasource for training: `\{"splitting":\{"percentBegin":70,
    #     "percentEnd":100, "strategy":"random",
    #     "randomSeed"="s3://my_s3_path/bucket/file.csv",
    #     "complement":"true"\}\}`

    #   `DataRearrangement` parameter is not provided, all of the input data
    #   is used to create the `Datasource`.
    #
    #   There are multiple parameters that control what data is used to
    #   create a datasource:
    #
    #   * **`percentBegin`**
    #
    #     Use `percentBegin` to indicate the beginning of the range of the
    #     data used to create the Datasource. If you do not include
    #     `percentBegin` and `percentEnd`, Amazon ML includes all of the
    #     data when creating the datasource.
    #
    #   * **`percentEnd`**
    #
    #     Use `percentEnd` to indicate the end of the range of the data used
    #     to create the Datasource. If you do not include `percentBegin` and
    #     `percentEnd`, Amazon ML includes all of the data when creating the
    #     datasource.
    #
    #   * **`complement`**
    #
    #     The `complement` parameter instructs Amazon ML to use the data
    #     that is not included in the range of `percentBegin` to
    #     `percentEnd` to create a datasource. The `complement` parameter is
    #     useful if you need to create complementary datasources for
    #     training and evaluation. To create a complementary datasource, use
    #     the same values for `percentBegin` and `percentEnd`, along with
    #     the `complement` parameter.
    #
    #     For example, the following two datasources do not share any data,
    #     and can be used to train and evaluate a model. The first
    #     datasource has 25 percent of the data, and the second one has 75
    #     percent of the data.
    #
    #     Datasource for evaluation: `\{"splitting":\{"percentBegin":0,
    #     "percentEnd":25\}\}`
    #
    #     Datasource for training: `\{"splitting":\{"percentBegin":0,
    #     "percentEnd":25, "complement":"true"\}\}`
    #
    #   * **`strategy`**
    #
    #     To change how Amazon ML splits the data for a datasource, use the
    #     `strategy` parameter.
    #
    #     The default value for the `strategy` parameter is `sequential`,
    #     meaning that Amazon ML takes all of the data records between the
    #     `percentBegin` and `percentEnd` parameters for the datasource, in
    #     the order that the records appear in the input data.
    #
    #     The following two `DataRearrangement` lines are examples of
    #     sequentially ordered training and evaluation datasources:
    #
    #     Datasource for evaluation: `\{"splitting":\{"percentBegin":70,
    #     "percentEnd":100, "strategy":"sequential"\}\}`
    #
    #     Datasource for training: `\{"splitting":\{"percentBegin":70,
    #     "percentEnd":100, "strategy":"sequential",
    #     "complement":"true"\}\}`
    #
    #     To randomly split the input data into the proportions indicated by
    #     the percentBegin and percentEnd parameters, set the `strategy`
    #     parameter to `random` and provide a string that is used as the
    #     seed value for the random data splitting (for example, you can use
    #     the S3 path to your data as the random seed string). If you choose
    #     the random split strategy, Amazon ML assigns each row of data a
    #     pseudo-random number between 0 and 100, and then selects the rows
    #     that have an assigned number between `percentBegin` and
    #     `percentEnd`. Pseudo-random numbers are assigned using both the
    #     input seed string value and the byte offset as a seed, so changing
    #     the data results in a different split. Any existing ordering is
    #     preserved. The random splitting strategy ensures that variables in
    #     the training and evaluation data are distributed similarly. It is
    #     useful in the cases where the input data may have an implicit sort
    #     order, which would otherwise result in training and evaluation
