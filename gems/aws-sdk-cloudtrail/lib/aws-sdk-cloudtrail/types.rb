    #
    # @!attribute [rw] field
    #   A field in an event record on which to filter events to be logged.
    #   Supported fields include `readOnly`, `eventCategory`, `eventSource`
    #   (for management events), `eventName`, `resources.type`, and
    #   `resources.ARN`.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>readOnly</code> </b> - Optional. Can be set to `Equals`
    #     a value of `true` or `false`. If you do not add this field,
    #     CloudTrail logs both both `read` and `write` events. A value of
    #     `true` logs only `read` events. A value of `false` logs only
    #     `write` events.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>eventSource</code> </b> - For filtering management
    #     events only. This can be set only to `NotEquals`
    #     `kms.amazonaws.com`.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>eventName</code> </b> - Can use any operator. You can
    #     use it to ﬁlter in or ﬁlter out any data event logged to
    #     CloudTrail, such as `PutBucket` or `GetSnapshotBlock`. You can
    #     have multiple values for this ﬁeld, separated by commas.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>eventCategory</code> </b> - This is required. It must be
    #     set to `Equals`, and the value must be `Management` or `Data`.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>resources.type</code> </b> - This ﬁeld is required.
    #     `resources.type` can only use the `Equals` operator, and the value
    #     can be one of the following:
    #
    #     * `AWS::S3::Object`
    #
    #     * `AWS::Lambda::Function`
    #
    #     * `AWS::DynamoDB::Table`
    #
    #     * `AWS::S3Outposts::Object`
    #
    #     * `AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node`
    #
    #     * `AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint`
    #
    #     * `AWS::EC2::Snapshot`
    #
    #     * `AWS::S3::AccessPoint`
    #
    #     * `AWS::DynamoDB::Stream`
    #
    #     * `AWS::Glue::Table`
    #
    #     You can have only one `resources.type` ﬁeld per selector. To log
    #     data events on more than one resource type, add another selector.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>resources.ARN</code> </b> - You can use any operator
    #     with `resources.ARN`, but if you use `Equals` or `NotEquals`, the
    #     value must exactly match the ARN of a valid resource of the type
    #     you've speciﬁed in the template as the value of resources.type.
    #     For example, if resources.type equals `AWS::S3::Object`, the ARN
    #     must be in one of the following formats. To log all data events
    #     for all objects in a specific S3 bucket, use the `StartsWith`
    #     operator, and include only the bucket ARN as the matching value.
    #
    #     The trailing slash is intentional; do not exclude it. Replace the
    #     text between less than and greater than symbols (&lt;&gt;) with
    #     resource-specific information.
    #
    #     * `arn:<partition>:s3:::<bucket_name>/`
    #
    #     * `arn:<partition>:s3:::<bucket_name>/<object_path>/`
    #
    #     When `resources.type` equals `AWS::S3::AccessPoint`, and the
    #     operator is set to `Equals` or `NotEquals`, the ARN must be in one
    #     of the following formats. To log events on all objects in an S3
    #     access point, we recommend that you use only the access point ARN,
    #     don’t include the object path, and use the `StartsWith` or
    #     `NotStartsWith` operators.
    #
    #     * `arn:<partition>:s3:<region>:<account_ID>:accesspoint/<access_point_name>`
    #
    #     * `arn:<partition>:s3:<region>:<account_ID>:accesspoint/<access_point_name>/object/<object_path>`
    #
    #     When resources.type equals `AWS::Lambda::Function`, and the

    #
    #     * `arn:<partition>:dynamodb:<region>:<account_ID>:table/<table_name>`
    #
    #     ^
    #
    #     When `resources.type` equals `AWS::S3Outposts::Object`, and the

    #
    #     * `arn:<partition>:s3-outposts:<region>:<account_ID>:<object_path>`
    #
    #     ^
    #
    #     When `resources.type` equals `AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node`, and
    #     the operator is set to `Equals` or `NotEquals`, the ARN must be in
    #     the following format:
    #
    #     * `arn:<partition>:managedblockchain:<region>:<account_ID>:nodes/<node_ID>`
    #
    #     ^
    #
    #     When `resources.type` equals `AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint`,

    # The Amazon S3 buckets, Lambda functions, or Amazon DynamoDB tables
    # that you specify in your event selectors for your trail to log data
    # events. Data events provide information about the resource operations
    # performed on or within a resource itself. These are also known as data
    # plane operations. You can specify up to 250 data resources for a
    # trail.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> The total number of allowed data resources is 250. This number can be
    # distributed between 1 and 5 event selectors, but the total cannot

    #  </note>
    #
    # The following example demonstrates how logging works when you
    # configure logging of all data events for an S3 bucket named
    # `bucket-1`. In this example, the CloudTrail user specified an empty
    # prefix, and the option to log both `Read` and `Write` data events.
    #
    # 1.  A user uploads an image file to `bucket-1`.
    #
    # 2.  The `PutObject` API operation is an Amazon S3 object-level API. It
    #     is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail
    #     user specified an S3 bucket with an empty prefix, events that
    #     occur on any object in that bucket are logged. The trail processes
    #     and logs the event.
    #
    # 3.  A user uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named
    #     `arn:aws:s3:::bucket-2`.
    #
    # 4.  The `PutObject` API operation occurred for an object in an S3
    #     bucket that the CloudTrail user didn't specify for the trail. The
    #     trail doesn’t log the event.
    #
    # The following example demonstrates how logging works when you
    # configure logging of Lambda data events for a Lambda function named
    # *MyLambdaFunction*, but not for all Lambda functions.
    #
    # 1.  A user runs a script that includes a call to the
    #     *MyLambdaFunction* function and the *MyOtherLambdaFunction*
    #     function.
    #
    # 2.  The `Invoke` API operation on *MyLambdaFunction* is an Lambda API.
    #     It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the
    #     CloudTrail user specified logging data events for
    #     *MyLambdaFunction*, any invocations of that function are logged.
    #     The trail processes and logs the event.
    #
    # 3.  The `Invoke` API operation on *MyOtherLambdaFunction* is an Lambda
    #     API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify logging data
    #     events for all Lambda functions, the `Invoke` operation for
    #     *MyOtherLambdaFunction* does not match the function specified for
    #     the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event.
