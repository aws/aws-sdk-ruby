    # The Amazon S3 objects that you specify in your event selectors for
    # your trail to log data events. Data events are object-level API
    # operations that access S3 objects, such as `GetObject`,
    # `DeleteObject`, and `PutObject`. You can specify up to 250 S3 buckets
    # and object prefixes for a trail.
    #
    # Example
    #
    # 1.  You create an event selector for a trail and specify an S3 bucket
    #     and an empty prefix, such as `arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/`.
    #
    # 2.  You upload an image file to `bucket-1`.
    #
    # 3.  The `PutObject` API operation occurs on an object in the S3 bucket
    #     that you specified in the event selector. The trail processes and
    #     logs the event.
    #
    # 4.  You upload another image file to a different S3 bucket named
    #     `arn:aws:s3:::bucket-2`.
    #
    # 5.  The event occurs on an object in an S3 bucket that you didn't
    #     specify in the event selector. The trail doesn’t log the event.

    #   The trail logs data events for all objects in this S3 bucket.
    #
    #   To log data events for specific objects, specify the S3 bucket and
