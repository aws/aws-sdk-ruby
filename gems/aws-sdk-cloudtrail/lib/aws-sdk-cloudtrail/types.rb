    # @!attribute [rw] field
    #   A field in a CloudTrail event record on which to filter events to be
    #   logged. For event data stores for CloudTrail Insights events, Config
    #   configuration items, Audit Manager evidence, or events outside of
    #   Amazon Web Services, the field is used only for selecting events as
    #   filtering is not supported.
    #
    #   For CloudTrail management events, supported fields include
    #   `readOnly`, `eventCategory`, and `eventSource`.
    #
    #   For CloudTrail data events, supported fields include `readOnly`,
    #   `eventCategory`, `eventName`, `resources.type`, and `resources.ARN`.
    #
    #   For event data stores for CloudTrail Insights events, Config
    #   configuration items, Audit Manager evidence, or events outside of
    #   Amazon Web Services, the only supported field is `eventCategory`.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>readOnly</code> </b> - Optional. Can be set to `Equals`
    #     a value of `true` or `false`. If you do not add this field,
    #     CloudTrail logs both `read` and `write` events. A value of `true`
    #     logs only `read` events. A value of `false` logs only `write`
    #     events.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>eventSource</code> </b> - For filtering management
    #     events only. This can be set to `NotEquals` `kms.amazonaws.com` or
    #     `NotEquals` `rdsdata.amazonaws.com`.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>eventName</code> </b> - Can use any operator. You can
    #     use it to ﬁlter in or ﬁlter out any data event logged to
    #     CloudTrail, such as `PutBucket` or `GetSnapshotBlock`. You can
    #     have multiple values for this ﬁeld, separated by commas.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>eventCategory</code> </b> - This is required and must be
    #     set to `Equals`.
    #
    #     * For CloudTrail management events, the value must be
    #       `Management`.
    #
    #     * For CloudTrail data events, the value must be `Data`.
    #
    #     The following are used only for event data stores:
    #
    #     * For CloudTrail Insights events, the value must be `Insight`.
    #
    #     * For Config configuration items, the value must be
    #       `ConfigurationItem`.
    #
    #     * For Audit Manager evidence, the value must be `Evidence`.

    #     operator, and include only the bucket ARN as the matching value.
    #

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] kms_key_id
    #   Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered by
    #   CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by `alias/`, a
    #   fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or
    #   a globally unique identifier.
    #
    #   Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing CloudTrail
    #   permissions on the key, prevents CloudTrail from logging events to
    #   the event data store, and prevents users from querying the data in
    #   the event data store that was encrypted with the key. After you
    #   associate an event data store with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be
    #   removed or changed. Before you disable or delete a KMS key that you
    #   are using with an event data store, delete or back up your event
    #   data store.
    #
    #   CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information
    #   about multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region keys][1] in the
    #   *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   Examples:
    #
    #   * `alias/MyAliasName`
    #
    #   * `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName`

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] billing_mode
    #   The billing mode for the event data store determines the cost for
    #   ingesting events and the default and maximum retention period for
    #   the event data store.
    #
    #   The following are the possible values:
    #
    #   * `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING` - This billing mode is generally
    #     recommended if you want a flexible retention period of up to 3653
    #     days (about 10 years). The default retention period for this
    #     billing mode is 366 days.
    #
    #   * `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING` - This billing mode is recommended if
    #     you expect to ingest more than 25 TB of event data per month and
    #     need a retention period of up to 2557 days (about 7 years). The
    #     default retention period for this billing mode is 2557 days.
    #
    #   The default value is `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING`.

    # The following example demonstrates how logging works when you
    # configure logging of all data events for an S3 bucket named
    # `bucket-1`. In this example, the CloudTrail user specified an empty
    # prefix, and the option to log both `Read` and `Write` data events.
    #
    # 1.  A user uploads an image file to `bucket-1`.
    #
    # 2.  The `PutObject` API operation is an Amazon S3 object-level API. It
    #     is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail
    #     user specified an S3 bucket with an empty prefix, events that
    #     occur on any object in that bucket are logged. The trail processes
    #     and logs the event.
    #
    # 3.  A user uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named
    #     `arn:aws:s3:::bucket-2`.
    #
    # 4.  The `PutObject` API operation occurred for an object in an S3
    #     bucket that the CloudTrail user didn't specify for the trail. The
    #     trail doesn’t log the event.
    #
    # The following example demonstrates how logging works when you
    # configure logging of Lambda data events for a Lambda function named
    # *MyLambdaFunction*, but not for all Lambda functions.
    #
    # 1.  A user runs a script that includes a call to the
    #     *MyLambdaFunction* function and the *MyOtherLambdaFunction*
    #     function.
    #
    # 2.  The `Invoke` API operation on *MyLambdaFunction* is an Lambda API.
    #     It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the
    #     CloudTrail user specified logging data events for
    #     *MyLambdaFunction*, any invocations of that function are logged.
    #     The trail processes and logs the event.
    #
    # 3.  The `Invoke` API operation on *MyOtherLambdaFunction* is an Lambda
    #     API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify logging data
    #     events for all Lambda functions, the `Invoke` operation for
    #     *MyOtherLambdaFunction* does not match the function specified for
    #     the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event.

    #   fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or
    #   a globally unique identifier.
    #
    #   Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing CloudTrail
    #   permissions on the key, prevents CloudTrail from logging events to
    #   the event data store, and prevents users from querying the data in
    #   the event data store that was encrypted with the key. After you
    #   associate an event data store with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be
    #   removed or changed. Before you disable or delete a KMS key that you
    #   are using with an event data store, delete or back up your event
    #   data store.
    #
    #   CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information
    #   about multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region keys][1] in the
    #   *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   Examples:

    #   `BillingMode` is set to `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING` and you want
    #   to use `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING` instead, you'll need to stop
    #   ingestion on the event data store and create a new event data store
    #   that uses `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING`.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   The billing mode for the event data store determines the cost for

    #
    #   The following are the possible values:
    #
    #   * `EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING` - This billing mode is generally
    #     recommended if you want a flexible retention period of up to 3653
    #     days (about 10 years). The default retention period for this
    #     billing mode is 366 days.
    #
    #   * `FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING` - This billing mode is recommended if
    #     you expect to ingest more than 25 TB of event data per month and
    #     need a retention period of up to 2557 days (about 7 years). The
    #     default retention period for this billing mode is 2557 days.

    #   CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information
    #   about multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region keys][1] in the
    #   *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   Examples:
    #
    #   * alias/MyAliasName
    #
    #   * arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName

    # @!attribute [rw] is_organization_trail
    #   Specifies whether the trail is applied to all accounts in an
    #   organization in Organizations, or only for the current Amazon Web
    #   Services account. The default is false, and cannot be true unless
    #   the call is made on behalf of an Amazon Web Services account that is
    #   the management account for an organization in Organizations. If the
    #   trail is not an organization trail and this is set to `true`, the
    #   trail will be created in all Amazon Web Services accounts that
    #   belong to the organization. If the trail is an organization trail
    #   and this is set to `false`, the trail will remain in the current
    #   Amazon Web Services account but be deleted from all member accounts
    #   in the organization.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Only the management account for the organization can convert an
    #   organization trail to a non-organization trail, or convert a
    #   non-organization trail to an organization trail.
