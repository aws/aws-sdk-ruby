    #   session name to the external account in their CloudTrail logs.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] duration_seconds
    #   The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value specified
    #   can can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum
    #   session duration that is set for the role. The maximum session
    #   duration setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you
    #   specify a value higher than this setting or the administrator
    #   setting (whichever is lower), the operation fails. For example, if
    #   you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator
    #   set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails.
    #   To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see [View the
    #   Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role][1] in the *IAM User

    #
    #   By default, the value is set to `3600` seconds.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> The `DurationSeconds` parameter is separate from the duration of a

    # @!attribute [rw] tags
    #   A list of session tags that you want to pass. Each session tag
    #   consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information
    #   about session tags, see [Tagging STS Sessions][1] in the *IAM User
    #   Guide*.
    #
    #   This parameter is optional. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The
    #   plaintext session tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters, and the
    #   values can’t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits,
    #   see [IAM and STS Character Limits][2] in the *IAM User Guide*.

    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is
    #   already attached to the role. When you do, session tags override a
    #   role tag with the same key.
    #
    #   Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved.
    #   This means that you cannot have separate `Department` and
    #   `department` tag keys. Assume that the role has the
    #   `Department`=`Marketing` tag and you pass the
    #   `department`=`engineering` session tag. `Department` and
    #   `department` are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag
    #   passed in the request takes precedence over the role tag.
    #
    #   Additionally, if you used temporary credentials to perform this
    #   operation, the new session inherits any transitive session tags from
    #   the calling session. If you pass a session tag with the same key as
    #   an inherited tag, the operation fails. To view the inherited tags
    #   for a session, see the CloudTrail logs. For more information, see

    #   passes to subsequent sessions in a role chain. For more information,
    #   see [Chaining Roles with Session Tags][1] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    #   This parameter is optional. When you set session tags as transitive,
    #   the session policy and session tags packed binary limit is not
    #   affected.

    #   A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in
    #   another account. If the administrator of the account to which the
    #   role belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that
    #   value in the `ExternalId` parameter. This value can be any string,
    #   such as a passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is
    #   usually set up to trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the
    #   administrator of the trusting account might send an external ID to
    #   the administrator of the trusted account. That way, only someone
    #   with the ID can assume the role, rather than everyone in the
    #   account. For more information about the external ID, see [How to Use
    #   an External ID When Granting Access to Your Amazon Web Services

    #   The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with
    #   the user who is making the `AssumeRole` call. Specify this value if
    #   the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that
    #   requires MFA authentication. The value is either the serial number

    #
    #   You can require users to specify a source identity when they assume
    #   a role. You do this by using the `sts:SourceIdentity` condition key

    # @!attribute [rw] duration_seconds
    #   The duration, in seconds, of the role session. Your role session
    #   lasts for the duration that you specify for the `DurationSeconds`
    #   parameter, or until the time specified in the SAML authentication
    #   response's `SessionNotOnOrAfter` value, whichever is shorter. You
    #   can provide a `DurationSeconds` value from 900 seconds (15 minutes)
    #   up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This
    #   setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a
    #   value higher than this setting, the operation fails. For example, if
    #   you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator
    #   set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails.
    #   To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see [View the
    #   Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role][1] in the *IAM User
    #   Guide*.
    #
    #   By default, the value is set to `3600` seconds.

    #   <note markdown="1"> The `DurationSeconds` parameter is separate from the duration of a
