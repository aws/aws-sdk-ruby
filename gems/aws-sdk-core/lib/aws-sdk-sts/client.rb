    # @overload initialize(options)
    #   @param [Hash] options
    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading static credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleWebIdentityCredentials` - Used when you need to
    #       assume a role after providing credentials via the web.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SSOCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from AWS SSO using an
    #       access token generated from `aws login`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ProcessCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       process that outputs to stdout.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ECSCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from
    #       instances running in ECS.
    #
    #     * `Aws::CognitoIdentityCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from the Cognito Identity service.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2/ECS IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts
    #       are very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #       `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` or `Aws::ECSCredentials` to
    #       enable retries and extended timeouts.
    #
    #   @option options [required, String] :region
    #     The AWS region to connect to.  The configured `:region` is

    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:region]`
    #     * `ENV['AWS_REGION']`
    #     * `ENV['AMAZON_REGION']`
    #     * `ENV['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION']`

    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :adaptive_retry_wait_to_fill (true)
    #     Used only in `adaptive` retry mode.  When true, the request will sleep
    #     until there is sufficent client side capacity to retry the request.

    #     in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #     @see https://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2015/03/backoff.html
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_limit (3)
    #     The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #     ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #     are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #     checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors, auth errors,
    #     endpoint discovery, and errors from expired credentials.
    #     This option is only used in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_max_delay (0)
    #     The maximum number of seconds to delay between retries (0 for no limit)
    #     used by the default backoff function. This option is only used in the
    #     `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :retry_mode ("legacy")
    #     Specifies which retry algorithm to use. Values are:
    #
    #     * `legacy` - The pre-existing retry behavior.  This is default value if
    #       no retry mode is provided.
    #
    #     * `standard` - A standardized set of retry rules across the AWS SDKs.
    #       This includes support for retry quotas, which limit the number of
    #       unsuccessful retries a client can make.
    #
    #     * `adaptive` - An experimental retry mode that includes all the
    #       functionality of `standard` mode along with automatic client side
    #       throttling.  This is a provisional mode that may change behavior
    #       in the future.
    #
    #
    #   @option options [String] :secret_access_key
    #
    #   @option options [String] :session_token
    #
    #   @option options [String] :sts_regional_endpoints ("regional")
    #     Passing in 'regional' to enable regional endpoint for STS for all supported

    #     regions to resolve to the STS global endpoint.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #     Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #     fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #     the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #     {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #     ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #     requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #     When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #     sending the request.
    #
    #   @option options [URI::HTTP,String] :http_proxy A proxy to send
    #     requests through.  Formatted like 'http://proxy.com:123'.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_open_timeout (15) The number of
    #     seconds to wait when opening a HTTP session before raising a
    #     `Timeout::Error`.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :http_read_timeout (60) The default
    #     number of seconds to wait for response data.  This value can
    #     safely be set per-request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_idle_timeout (5) The number of
    #     seconds a connection is allowed to sit idle before it is
    #     considered stale.  Stale connections are closed and removed
    #     from the pool before making a request.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_continue_timeout (1) The number of
    #     seconds to wait for a 100-continue response before sending the
    #     request body.  This option has no effect unless the request has
    #     "Expect" header set to "100-continue".  Defaults to `nil` which
    #     disables this behaviour.  This value can safely be set per
    #     request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :http_wire_trace (false) When `true`,
    #     HTTP debug output will be sent to the `:logger`.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :ssl_verify_peer (true) When `true`,
    #     SSL peer certificates are verified when establishing a
    #     connection.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_bundle Full path to the SSL
    #     certificate authority bundle file that should be used when
    #     verifying peer certificates.  If you do not pass
    #     `:ssl_ca_bundle` or `:ssl_ca_directory` the the system default
    #     will be used if available.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_directory Full path of the
    #     directory that contains the unbundled SSL certificate
    #     authority files for verifying peer certificates.  If you do
    #     not pass `:ssl_ca_bundle` or `:ssl_ca_directory` the the
    #     system default will be used if available.

    # @!group API Operations

    # Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to
    # access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to. These
    # temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access
    # key, and a security token. Typically, you use `AssumeRole` within your
    # account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of `AssumeRole`
    # with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see
    # [Requesting Temporary Security Credentials][1] and [Comparing the AWS
    # STS API operations][2] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # You cannot use AWS account root user credentials to call `AssumeRole`.
    # You must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to call
    # `AssumeRole`.
    #
    # For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and
    # need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term
    # credentials in each account to access those resources. However,
    # managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access
    # which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set
    # of long-term credentials in one account. Then use temporary security
    # credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming roles in
    # those accounts. For more information about roles, see [IAM Roles][3]
    # in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # **Session Duration**
    #
    # By default, the temporary security credentials created by `AssumeRole`
    # last for one hour. However, you can use the optional `DurationSeconds`
    # parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a
    # value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration
    # setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12
    # hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see [View
    # the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role][4] in the *IAM User
    # Guide*. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the
    # `AssumeRole*` API operations or the `assume-role*` CLI commands.
    # However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to
    # create a console URL. For more information, see [Using IAM Roles][5]
    # in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # **Permissions**
    #
    # The temporary security credentials created by `AssumeRole` can be used
    # to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: You
    # cannot call the AWS STS `GetFederationToken` or `GetSessionToken` API
    # operations.
    #
    # (Optional) You can pass inline or managed [session policies][6] to
    # this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as
    # an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed
    # policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you
    # use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048
    # characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary
    # credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection
    # of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can
    # use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to
    # access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use
    # session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the
    # identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more
    # information, see [Session Policies][6] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be
    # trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's
    # trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which
    # accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account.
    #
    # A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also
    # have permissions that are delegated from the user account
    # administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the
    # user to call `AssumeRole` for the ARN of the role in the other
    # account. If the user is in the same account as the role, then you can
    # do either of the following:
    #
    # * Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a
    #   different account).
    #
    # * Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.
    #
    # In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy.
    # Users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission
    # to assume the role. For more information about trust policies and
    # resource-based policies, see [IAM Policies][7] in the *IAM User
    # Guide*.
    #
    # **Tags**
    #
    # (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These
    # tags are called session tags. For more information about session tags,
    # see [Passing Session Tags in STS][8] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass
    # session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions
    # to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information,
    # see [Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control][9] in
    # the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist
    # during role chaining. For more information, see [Chaining Roles with
    # Session Tags][10] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # **Using MFA with AssumeRole**
    #
    # (Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA)
    # information when you call `AssumeRole`. This is useful for
    # cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role
    # has been authenticated with an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the
    # trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests
    # for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA
    # information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition
    # in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like
    # the following example.
    #
    # `"Condition": \{"Bool": \{"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true\}\}`
    #
    # For more information, see [Configuring MFA-Protected API Access][11]
    # in the *IAM User Guide* guide.
    #
    # To use MFA with `AssumeRole`, you pass values for the `SerialNumber`
    # and `TokenCode` parameters. The `SerialNumber` value identifies the
    # user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The `TokenCode` is the
    # time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces.

    # @option params [required, String] :role_arn
    #   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :role_session_name
    #   An identifier for the assumed role session.
    #
    #   Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same
    #   role is assumed by different principals or for different reasons. In
    #   cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible to, and can
    #   be logged by the account that owns the role. The role session name is
    #   also used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that
    #   subsequent cross-account API requests that use the temporary security
    #   credentials will expose the role session name to the external account
    #   in their AWS CloudTrail logs.
    #
    #   The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
    #   consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
    #   spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
    #   characters: =,.@-
    #
    # @option params [Array<Types::PolicyDescriptorType>] :policy_arns
    #   The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you
    #   want to use as managed session policies. The policies must exist in
    #   the same account as the role.
    #
    #   This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed policy
    #   ARNs. However, the plain text that you use for both inline and managed
    #   session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. For more information
    #   about ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service
    #   Namespaces][1] in the AWS General Reference.

    # @option params [String] :policy
    #   An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session
    #   policy.
    #
    #   This parameter is optional. Passing policies to this operation returns
    #   new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are
    #   the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session
    #   policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent

    #
    # @option params [Integer] :duration_seconds
    #   The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range
    #   from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration
    #   setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12
    #   hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting, the operation
    #   fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but
    #   your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your
    #   operation fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role,
    #   see [View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role][1] in the
    #   *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    #   By default, the value is set to `3600` seconds.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> The `DurationSeconds` parameter is separate from the duration of a
    #   console session that you might request using the returned credentials.
    #   The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token
    #   takes a `SessionDuration` parameter that specifies the maximum length

    # @option params [Array<Types::Tag>] :tags
    #   A list of session tags that you want to pass. Each session tag
    #   consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information
    #   about session tags, see [Tagging AWS STS Sessions][1] in the *IAM User
    #   Guide*.
    #
    #   This parameter is optional. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The
    #   plain text session tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters, and the
    #   values can’t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits,
    #   see [IAM and STS Character Limits][2] in the *IAM User Guide*.

    #   the upper size limit.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is already
    #   attached to the role. When you do, session tags override a role tag
    #   with the same key.
    #
    #   Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved.
    #   This means that you cannot have separate `Department` and `department`
    #   tag keys. Assume that the role has the `Department`=`Marketing` tag
    #   and you pass the `department`=`engineering` session tag. `Department`
    #   and `department` are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag
    #   passed in the request takes precedence over the role tag.
    #
    #   Additionally, if you used temporary credentials to perform this
    #   operation, the new session inherits any transitive session tags from
    #   the calling session. If you pass a session tag with the same key as an
    #   inherited tag, the operation fails. To view the inherited tags for a

    # @option params [String] :external_id
    #   A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in
    #   another account. If the administrator of the account to which the role
    #   belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in
    #   the `ExternalId` parameter. This value can be any string, such as a
    #   passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is usually set up
    #   to trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the
    #   trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the
    #   trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the
    #   role, rather than everyone in the account. For more information about
    #   the external ID, see [How to Use an External ID When Granting Access
    #   to Your AWS Resources to a Third Party][1] in the *IAM User Guide*.

    # @option params [String] :serial_number
    #   The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with
    #   the user who is making the `AssumeRole` call. Specify this value if
    #   the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that
    #   requires MFA authentication. The value is either the serial number for
    #   a hardware device (such as `GAHT12345678`) or an Amazon Resource Name
    #   (ARN) for a virtual device (such as

    # Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have
    # been authenticated via a SAML authentication response. This operation
    # provides a mechanism for tying an enterprise identity store or
    # directory to role-based AWS access without user-specific credentials
    # or configuration. For a comparison of `AssumeRoleWithSAML` with the
    # other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see
    # [Requesting Temporary Security Credentials][1] and [Comparing the AWS
    # STS API operations][2] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # The temporary security credentials returned by this operation consist
    # of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token.
    # Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign
    # calls to AWS services.
    #
    # **Session Duration**
    #
    # By default, the temporary security credentials created by
    # `AssumeRoleWithSAML` last for one hour. However, you can use the
    # optional `DurationSeconds` parameter to specify the duration of your
    # session. Your role session lasts for the duration that you specify, or
    # until the time specified in the SAML authentication response's
    # `SessionNotOnOrAfter` value, whichever is shorter. You can provide a
    # `DurationSeconds` value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the
    # maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a
    # value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value
    # for your role, see [View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a
    # Role][3] in the *IAM User Guide*. The maximum session duration limit
    # applies when you use the `AssumeRole*` API operations or the
    # `assume-role*` CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you
    # use those operations to create a console URL. For more information,
    # see [Using IAM Roles][4] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # **Permissions**
    #
    # The temporary security credentials created by `AssumeRoleWithSAML` can
    # be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following
    # exception: you cannot call the STS `GetFederationToken` or
    # `GetSessionToken` API operations.
    #
    # (Optional) You can pass inline or managed [session policies][5] to
    # this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as
    # an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed
    # policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you
    # use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048
    # characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary
    # credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection
    # of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can
    # use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to
    # access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use
    # session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the
    # identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more
    # information, see [Session Policies][5] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # Calling `AssumeRoleWithSAML` does not require the use of AWS security
    # credentials. The identity of the caller is validated by using keys in
    # the metadata document that is uploaded for the SAML provider entity
    # for your identity provider.
    #
    # Calling `AssumeRoleWithSAML` can result in an entry in your AWS
    # CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the value in the `NameID` element
    # of the SAML assertion. We recommend that you use a `NameIDType` that
    # is not associated with any personally identifiable information (PII).
    # For example, you could instead use the persistent identifier
    # (`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent`).
    #
    # **Tags**
    #
    # (Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your
    # SAML assertion as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key
    # name and an associated value. For more information about session tags,
    # see [Passing Session Tags in STS][6] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plain text session tag keys
    # can’t exceed 128 characters and the values can’t exceed 256
    # characters. For these and additional limits, see [IAM and STS
    # Character Limits][7] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session
    # tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your
    # request can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the
    # other requirements. The `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates
    # by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to
    # the upper size limit.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached
    # to the role. When you do, session tags override the role's tags with
    # the same key.
    #
    # An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass
    # session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions
    # to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information,
    # see [Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control][8] in
    # the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist
    # during role chaining. For more information, see [Chaining Roles with
    # Session Tags][9] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # **SAML Configuration**
    #
    # Before your application can call `AssumeRoleWithSAML`, you must
    # configure your SAML identity provider (IdP) to issue the claims
    # required by AWS. Additionally, you must use AWS Identity and Access
    # Management (IAM) to create a SAML provider entity in your AWS account
    # that represents your identity provider. You must also create an IAM
    # role that specifies this SAML provider in its trust policy.
    #

    # @option params [String] :policy
    #   An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session

    # @option params [Integer] :duration_seconds
    #   The duration, in seconds, of the role session. Your role session lasts
    #   for the duration that you specify for the `DurationSeconds` parameter,
    #   or until the time specified in the SAML authentication response's
    #   `SessionNotOnOrAfter` value, whichever is shorter. You can provide a
    #   `DurationSeconds` value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the
    #   maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a
    #   value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this
    #   setting, the operation fails. For example, if you specify a session
    #   duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session
    #   duration to 6 hours, your operation fails. To learn how to view the
    #   maximum value for your role, see [View the Maximum Session Duration
    #   Setting for a Role][1] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    #   By default, the value is set to `3600` seconds.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> The `DurationSeconds` parameter is separate from the duration of a
    #   console session that you might request using the returned credentials.
    #   The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token

    # Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have
    # been authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity
    # provider. Example providers include Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon,
    # Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You
    # can use Amazon Cognito with the [AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide][1]
    # and the [AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide][2] to uniquely identify
    # a user. You can also supply the user with a consistent identity
    # throughout the lifetime of an application.
    #
    #  To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see [Amazon Cognito Overview][3]
    # in *AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide* and [Amazon Cognito
    # Overview][4] in the *AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide*.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # Calling `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` does not require the use of AWS
    # security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application
    # (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security
    # credentials without including long-term AWS credentials in the
    # application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy
    # services that use long-term AWS credentials. Instead, the identity of
    # the caller is validated by using a token from the web identity
    # provider. For a comparison of `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` with the
    # other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see
    # [Requesting Temporary Security Credentials][5] and [Comparing the AWS
    # STS API operations][6] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an
    # access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications
    # can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS
    # service API operations.
    #
    # **Session Duration**
    #
    # By default, the temporary security credentials created by
    # `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` last for one hour. However, you can use
    # the optional `DurationSeconds` parameter to specify the duration of
    # your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up
    # to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can
    # have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum
    # value for your role, see [View the Maximum Session Duration Setting
    # for a Role][7] in the *IAM User Guide*. The maximum session duration
    # limit applies when you use the `AssumeRole*` API operations or the
    # `assume-role*` CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you
    # use those operations to create a console URL. For more information,
    # see [Using IAM Roles][8] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # **Permissions**
    #
    # The temporary security credentials created by
    # `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` can be used to make API calls to any AWS
    # service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS
    # `GetFederationToken` or `GetSessionToken` API operations.
    #
    # (Optional) You can pass inline or managed [session policies][9] to
    # this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as
    # an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed
    # policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you
    # use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048
    # characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary
    # credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection
    # of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can
    # use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to
    # access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use
    # session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the
    # identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more
    # information, see [Session Policies][9] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # **Tags**
    #
    # (Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your web
    # identity token as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key
    # name and an associated value. For more information about session tags,
    # see [Passing Session Tags in STS][10] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plain text session tag keys
    # can’t exceed 128 characters and the values can’t exceed 256
    # characters. For these and additional limits, see [IAM and STS
    # Character Limits][11] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session
    # tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your
    # request can fail for this limit even if your plain text meets the
    # other requirements. The `PackedPolicySize` response element indicates
    # by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to
    # the upper size limit.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached
    # to the role. When you do, the session tag overrides the role tag with
    # the same key.
    #
    # An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass
    # session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions
    # to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information,
    # see [Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control][12] in
    # the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist
    # during role chaining. For more information, see [Chaining Roles with
    # Session Tags][13] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # **Identities**
    #
    # Before your application can call `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`, you must
    # have an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a
    # role that the application can assume. The role that your application
    # assumes must trust the identity provider that is associated with the
    # identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be
    # specified in the role's trust policy.
    #
    # Calling `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` can result in an entry in your AWS
    # CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the [Subject][14] of the provided
    # Web Identity Token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally
    # identifiable information (PII) in this field. For example, you could
    # instead use a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as [suggested in the OIDC
    # specification][15].
    #
    # For more information about how to use web identity federation and the
    # `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` API, see the following resources:
    #
    # * [Using Web Identity Federation API Operations for Mobile Apps][16]
    #   and [Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider][17].

    #   of authenticating through Login with Amazon, Facebook, or Google,
    #   getting temporary security credentials, and then using those

    #
    # * [AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide][1] and [AWS SDK for Android
    #   Developer Guide][2]. These toolkits contain sample apps that show
    #   how to invoke the identity providers. The toolkits then show how to
    #   use the information from these providers to get and use temporary
    #   security credentials.
    #
    # * [Web Identity Federation with Mobile Applications][19]. This article
    #   discusses web identity federation and shows an example of how to use
    #   web identity federation to get access to content in Amazon S3.

    #   The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range
    #   from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration
    #   setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12
    #   hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting, the operation
    #   fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but
    #   your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your
    #   operation fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role,

    # Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an

    # temporary security credentials on behalf of distributed applications
    # inside a corporate network. You must call the `GetFederationToken`
    # operation using the long-term security credentials of an IAM user. As
    # a result, this call is appropriate in contexts where those credentials
    # can be safely stored, usually in a server-based application. For a
    # comparison of `GetFederationToken` with the other API operations that
    # produce temporary credentials, see [Requesting Temporary Security
    # Credentials][1] and [Comparing the AWS STS API operations][2] in the
    # *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can

    # Through a Web-based Identity Provider][4] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # You can also call `GetFederationToken` using the security credentials
    # of an AWS account root user, but we do not recommend it. Instead, we
    # recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy
    # application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits
    # federated users to only the actions and resources that they need to
    # access. For more information, see [IAM Best Practices][5] in the *IAM
    # User Guide*.
    #
    # **Session duration**
    #
    # The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from
    # 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36
    # hours). The default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours).
    # Temporary credentials that are obtained by using AWS account root user
    # credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).
    #
    # **Permissions**
    #
    # You can use the temporary credentials created by `GetFederationToken`
    # in any AWS service except the following:
    #
    # * You cannot call any IAM operations using the AWS CLI or the AWS API.
    #
    # * You cannot call any STS operations except `GetCallerIdentity`.
    #
    # You must pass an inline or managed [session policy][6] to this
    # operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an
    # inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies
    # to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for
    # both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048
    # characters.
    #
    # Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass
    # a policy, then the resulting federated user session has no
    # permissions. When you pass session policies, the session permissions

    #
    # Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved.
    # This means that you cannot have separate `Department` and `department`
    # tag keys. Assume that the user that you are federating has the
    # `Department`=`Marketing` tag and you pass the
    # `department`=`engineering` session tag. `Department` and `department`
    # are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the
    # request takes precedence over the user tag.

    # Returns a set of temporary credentials for an AWS account or IAM user.
    # The credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and
    # a security token. Typically, you use `GetSessionToken` if you want to
    # use MFA to protect programmatic calls to specific AWS API operations
    # like Amazon EC2 `StopInstances`. MFA-enabled IAM users would need to
    # call `GetSessionToken` and submit an MFA code that is associated with
    # their MFA device. Using the temporary security credentials that are
    # returned from the call, IAM users can then make programmatic calls to
    # API operations that require MFA authentication. If you do not supply a
    # correct MFA code, then the API returns an access denied error. For a
    # comparison of `GetSessionToken` with the other API operations that
    # produce temporary credentials, see [Requesting Temporary Security
    # Credentials][1] and [Comparing the AWS STS API operations][2] in the
    # *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # **Session Duration**
    #
    # The `GetSessionToken` operation must be called by using the long-term
    # AWS security credentials of the AWS account root user or an IAM user.
    # Credentials that are created by IAM users are valid for the duration
    # that you specify. This duration can range from 900 seconds (15
    # minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with a default
    # of 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Credentials based on account credentials
    # can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to 3,600 seconds (1 hour),
    # with a default of 1 hour.
    #
    # **Permissions**
    #
    # The temporary security credentials created by `GetSessionToken` can be
    # used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following
    # exceptions:
    #
    # * You cannot call any IAM API operations unless MFA authentication
    #   information is included in the request.
    #
    # * You cannot call any STS API *except* `AssumeRole` or
    #   `GetCallerIdentity`.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> We recommend that you do not call `GetSessionToken` with AWS account
    # root user credentials. Instead, follow our [best practices][3] by
    # creating one or more IAM users, giving them the necessary permissions,
    # and using IAM users for everyday interaction with AWS.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # The credentials that are returned by `GetSessionToken` are based on
    # permissions associated with the user whose credentials were used to
    # call the operation. If `GetSessionToken` is called using AWS account
    # root user credentials, the temporary credentials have root user
    # permissions. Similarly, if `GetSessionToken` is called using the
    # credentials of an IAM user, the temporary credentials have the same
    # permissions as the IAM user.
    #
    # For more information about using `GetSessionToken` to create temporary
    # credentials, go to [Temporary Credentials for Users in Untrusted
    # Environments][4] in the *IAM User Guide*.

    #   minutes) to 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with 43,200 seconds (12 hours)
    #   as the default. Sessions for AWS account owners are restricted to a

    #   one hour, the session for AWS account owners defaults to one hour.
    #
    # @option params [String] :serial_number
    #   The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with
    #   the IAM user who is making the `GetSessionToken` call. Specify this
    #   value if the IAM user has a policy that requires MFA authentication.
    #   The value is either the serial number for a hardware device (such as
    #   `GAHT12345678`) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device
    #   (such as `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user`). You can find the
    #   device for an IAM user by going to the AWS Management Console and
    #   viewing the user's security credentials.
    #
    #   The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
    #   consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
    #   spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
    #   characters: =,.@:/-
    #
    # @option params [String] :token_code
    #   The value provided by the MFA device, if MFA is required. If any
    #   policy requires the IAM user to submit an MFA code, specify this
    #   value. If MFA authentication is required, the user must provide a code
    #   when requesting a set of temporary security credentials. A user who
    #   fails to provide the code receives an "access denied" response when
    #   requesting resources that require MFA authentication.
    #
    #   The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a
    #   sequence of six numeric digits.
