    # @overload initialize(options)
    #   @param [Hash] options
    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2 IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts are
    #       very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #       `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` to enable retries and extended
    #       timeouts.
    #
    #   @option options [required, String] :region
    #     The AWS region to connect to.  The configured `:region` is
    #     used to determine the service `:endpoint`. When not passed,
    #     a default `:region` is search for in the following locations:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:region]`

    #     When `true`, an attempt is made to coerce request parameters into
    #     the required types.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :endpoint
    #     The client endpoint is normally constructed from the `:region`
    #     option. You should only configure an `:endpoint` when connecting

    # @!group API Operations

    # Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an
    # access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) that you can
    # use to access AWS resources that you might not normally have access
    # to. Typically, you use `AssumeRole` for cross-account access or
    # federation. For a comparison of `AssumeRole` with the other APIs that
    # produce temporary credentials, see [Requesting Temporary Security
    # Credentials][1] and [Comparing the AWS STS APIs][2] in the *IAM User
    # Guide*.
    #
    # **Important:** You cannot call `AssumeRole` by using AWS root account
    # credentials; access is denied. You must use credentials for an IAM
    # user or an IAM role to call `AssumeRole`.
    #
    # For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and
    # need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term
    # credentials in each account to access those resources. However,
    # managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access
    # which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set
    # of long-term credentials in one account and then use temporary
    # security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming
    # roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see [IAM
    # Roles (Delegation and Federation)][3] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # For federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to
    # the AWS Management Console. If you already have an identity and
    # authentication system in your corporate network, you don't have to
    # recreate user identities in AWS in order to grant those user
    # identities access to AWS. Instead, after a user has been
    # authenticated, you call `AssumeRole` (and specify the role with the
    # appropriate permissions) to get temporary security credentials for
    # that user. With those temporary security credentials, you construct a
    # sign-in URL that users can use to access the console. For more
    # information, see [Common Scenarios for Temporary Credentials][4] in
    # the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # By default, the temporary security credentials created by `AssumeRole`
    # last for one hour. However, you can use the optional `DurationSeconds`
    # parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a
    # value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration
    # setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12
    # hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see [View
    # the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role][5] in the *IAM User
    # Guide*. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the
    # `AssumeRole*` API operations or the `assume-role*` CLI operations but
    # does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL.
    # For more information, see [Using IAM Roles][6] in the *IAM User
    # Guide*.
    #
    # The temporary security credentials created by `AssumeRole` can be used
    # to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: you
    # cannot call the STS service's `GetFederationToken` or
    # `GetSessionToken` APIs.
    #
    # Optionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If
    # you choose not to pass a policy, the temporary security credentials
    # that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are
    # defined in the access policy of the role that is being assumed. If you
    # pass a policy to this operation, the temporary security credentials
    # that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are
    # allowed by both the access policy of the role that is being assumed,
    # <i> <b>and</b> </i> the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to
    # further restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary security
    # credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions
    # that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the role
    # that is being assumed. For more information, see [Permissions for
    # AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, and AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity][7] in
    # the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # To assume a role, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The
    # trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the
    # role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed
    # to delegate access to this account's role.
    #
    # The user who wants to access the role must also have permissions
    # delegated from the role's administrator. If the user is in a
    # different account than the role, then the user's administrator must
    # attach a policy that allows the user to call AssumeRole on the ARN of
    # the role in the other account. If the user is in the same account as
    # the role, then you can either attach a policy to the user (identical
    # to the previous different account user), or you can add the user as a
    # principal directly in the role's trust policy. In this case, the
    # trust policy acts as the only resource-based policy in IAM, and users
    # in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to
    # assume the role. For more information about trust policies and
    # resource-based policies, see [IAM Policies][8] in the *IAM User
    # Guide*.
    #
    # **Using MFA with AssumeRole**
    #
    # You can optionally include multi-factor authentication (MFA)
    # information when you call `AssumeRole`. This is useful for
    # cross-account scenarios in which you want to make sure that the user
    # who is assuming the role has been authenticated using an AWS MFA
    # device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed
    # includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication; if the caller
    # does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role
    # is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA
    # authentication might look like the following example.
    #
    # `"Condition": \{"Bool": \{"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true\}\}`
    #
    # For more information, see [Configuring MFA-Protected API Access][9] in
    # the *IAM User Guide* guide.
    #
    # To use MFA with `AssumeRole`, you pass values for the `SerialNumber`
    # and `TokenCode` parameters. The `SerialNumber` value identifies the
    # user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The `TokenCode` is the
    # time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA devices produces.

    # @option params [required, String] :role_arn
    #   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :role_session_name
    #   An identifier for the assumed role session.
    #
    #   Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same
    #   role is assumed by different principals or for different reasons. In
    #   cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible to, and can
    #   be logged by the account that owns the role. The role session name is
    #   also used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that
    #   subsequent cross-account API requests using the temporary security
    #   credentials will expose the role session name to the external account
    #   in their CloudTrail logs.
    #
    #   The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
    #   consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
    #   spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
    #   characters: =,.@-
    #
    # @option params [String] :policy
    #   An IAM policy in JSON format.
    #
    #   This parameter is optional. If you pass a policy, the temporary
    #   security credentials that are returned by the operation have the
    #   permissions that are allowed by both (the intersection of) the access
    #   policy of the role that is being assumed, *and* the policy that you
    #   pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the
    #   resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use the passed
    #   policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the
    #   access policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information,
    #   see [Permissions for AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, and
    #   AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity][1] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    #   The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a
    #   string of characters up to 2048 characters in length. The characters
    #   can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the
    #   valid character list (\\u0020-\\u00FF). It can also include the tab
    #   (\\u0009), linefeed (\\u000A), and carriage return (\\u000D)
    #   characters.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> The policy plain text must be 2048 bytes or shorter. However, an
    #   internal conversion compresses it into a packed binary format with a
    #   separate limit. The PackedPolicySize response element indicates by
    #   percentage how close to the upper size limit the policy is, with 100%
    #   equaling the maximum allowed size.

    #
    # @option params [Integer] :duration_seconds
    #   The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range
    #   from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration
    #   setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12
    #   hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting, the operation
    #   fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but
    #   your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your
    #   operation fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role,
    #   see [View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role][1] in the
    #   *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    #   By default, the value is set to 3600 seconds.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> The `DurationSeconds` parameter is separate from the duration of a
    #   console session that you might request using the returned credentials.
    #   The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token
    #   takes a `SessionDuration` parameter that specifies the maximum length
    #   of the console session. For more information, see [Creating a URL that
    #   Enables Federated Users to Access the AWS Management Console][2] in
    #   the *IAM User Guide*.

    #   assume, they should instruct their customers to ensure the role's
    #   trust policy checks for the external ID that the third party
    #   generated. Each time the third party assumes the role, they should

    # Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have

    # other APIs that produce temporary credentials, see [Requesting
    # Temporary Security Credentials][1] and [Comparing the AWS STS APIs][2]
    # in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # The temporary security credentials returned by this operation consist
    # of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token.
    # Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign
    # calls to AWS services.
    #
    # By default, the temporary security credentials created by
    # `AssumeRoleWithSAML` last for one hour. However, you can use the
    # optional `DurationSeconds` parameter to specify the duration of your
    # session. Your role session lasts for the duration that you specify, or
    # until the time specified in the SAML authentication response's
    # `SessionNotOnOrAfter` value, whichever is shorter. You can provide a
    # `DurationSeconds` value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the
    # maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a
    # value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value
    # for your role, see [View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a
    # Role][3] in the *IAM User Guide*. The maximum session duration limit
    # applies when you use the `AssumeRole*` API operations or the
    # `assume-role*` CLI operations but does not apply when you use those
    # operations to create a console URL. For more information, see [Using

    #
    # The temporary security credentials created by `AssumeRoleWithSAML` can

    # exception: you cannot call the STS service's `GetFederationToken` or
    # `GetSessionToken` APIs.
    #
    # Optionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If
    # you choose not to pass a policy, the temporary security credentials
    # that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are
    # defined in the access policy of the role that is being assumed. If you
    # pass a policy to this operation, the temporary security credentials
    # that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are
    # allowed by the intersection of both the access policy of the role that
    # is being assumed, <i> <b>and</b> </i> the policy that you pass. This
    # means that both policies must grant the permission for the action to
    # be allowed. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions
    # for the resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use the
    # passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed
    # by the access policy of the role that is being assumed. For more
    # information, see [Permissions for AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, and
    # AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity][5] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # Before your application can call `AssumeRoleWithSAML`, you must
    # configure your SAML identity provider (IdP) to issue the claims
    # required by AWS. Additionally, you must use AWS Identity and Access
    # Management (IAM) to create a SAML provider entity in your AWS account
    # that represents your identity provider, and create an IAM role that
    # specifies this SAML provider in its trust policy.
    #
    # Calling `AssumeRoleWithSAML` does not require the use of AWS security
    # credentials. The identity of the caller is validated by using keys in
    # the metadata document that is uploaded for the SAML provider entity
    # for your identity provider.
    #
    # Calling `AssumeRoleWithSAML` can result in an entry in your AWS
    # CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the value in the `NameID` element
    # of the SAML assertion. We recommend that you use a NameIDType that is
    # not associated with any personally identifiable information (PII). For
    # example, you could instead use the Persistent Identifier
    # (`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent`).

    #
    #   The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a
    #   string of characters up to 2048 characters in length. The characters
    #   can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the

    # @option params [Integer] :duration_seconds
    #   The duration, in seconds, of the role session. Your role session lasts
    #   for the duration that you specify for the `DurationSeconds` parameter,
    #   or until the time specified in the SAML authentication response's
    #   `SessionNotOnOrAfter` value, whichever is shorter. You can provide a
    #   `DurationSeconds` value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the
    #   maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a
    #   value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this
    #   setting, the operation fails. For example, if you specify a session
    #   duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session
    #   duration to 6 hours, your operation fails. To learn how to view the
    #   maximum value for your role, see [View the Maximum Session Duration
    #   Setting for a Role][1] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    #   By default, the value is set to 3600 seconds.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> The `DurationSeconds` parameter is separate from the duration of a
    #   console session that you might request using the returned credentials.
    #   The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token
    #   takes a `SessionDuration` parameter that specifies the maximum length

    #   The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a
    #   string of characters up to 2048 characters in length. The characters
    #   can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the
    #   valid character list (\\u0020-\\u00FF). It can also include the tab
    #   (\\u0009), linefeed (\\u000A), and carriage return (\\u000D)
    #   characters.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> The policy plain text must be 2048 bytes or shorter. However, an
    #   internal conversion compresses it into a packed binary format with a
    #   separate limit. The PackedPolicySize response element indicates by
    #   percentage how close to the upper size limit the policy is, with 100%

    # @option params [Integer] :duration_seconds
    #   The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range
    #   from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration
    #   setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12
    #   hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting, the operation
    #   fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but
    #   your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your
    #   operation fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role,
    #   see [View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role][1] in the
    #   *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    #   By default, the value is set to 3600 seconds.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> The `DurationSeconds` parameter is separate from the duration of a
    #   console session that you might request using the returned credentials.
    #   The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token
    #   takes a `SessionDuration` parameter that specifies the maximum length
    #   of the console session. For more information, see [Creating a URL that
    #   Enables Federated Users to Access the AWS Management Console][2] in

    # Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an

    # federated user. A typical use is in a proxy application that gets
    # temporary security credentials on behalf of distributed applications
    # inside a corporate network. Because you must call the
    # `GetFederationToken` action using the long-term security credentials
    # of an IAM user, this call is appropriate in contexts where those
    # credentials can be safely stored, usually in a server-based
    # application. For a comparison of `GetFederationToken` with the other
    # APIs that produce temporary credentials, see [Requesting Temporary
    # Security Credentials][1] and [Comparing the AWS STS APIs][2] in the
    # *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> If you are creating a mobile-based or browser-based app that can
    # authenticate users using a web identity provider like Login with
    # Amazon, Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity
    # provider, we recommend that you use [Amazon Cognito][3] or
    # `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`. For more information, see [Federation
    # Through a Web-based Identity Provider][4].
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # The `GetFederationToken` action must be called by using the long-term
    # AWS security credentials of an IAM user. You can also call
    # `GetFederationToken` using the security credentials of an AWS root
    # account, but we do not recommended it. Instead, we recommend that you
    # create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application and then
    # attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only
    # the actions and resources that they need access to. For more
    # information, see [IAM Best Practices][5] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # The temporary security credentials that are obtained by using the
    # long-term credentials of an IAM user are valid for the specified
    # duration, from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximium of 129600
    # seconds (36 hours). The default is 43200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary
    # credentials that are obtained by using AWS root account credentials
    # have a maximum duration of 3600 seconds (1 hour).
    #
    # The temporary security credentials created by `GetFederationToken` can
    # be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following
    # exceptions:
    #
    # * You cannot use these credentials to call any IAM APIs.
    #
    # * You cannot call any STS APIs except `GetCallerIdentity`.
    #
    # **Permissions**
    #
    # The permissions for the temporary security credentials returned by
    # `GetFederationToken` are determined by a combination of the following:
    #
    # * The policy or policies that are attached to the IAM user whose
    #   credentials are used to call `GetFederationToken`.
    #
    # * The policy that is passed as a parameter in the call.
    #
    # The passed policy is attached to the temporary security credentials
    # that result from the `GetFederationToken` API call--that is, to the
    # *federated user*. When the federated user makes an AWS request, AWS
    # evaluates the policy attached to the federated user in combination
    # with the policy or policies attached to the IAM user whose credentials
    # were used to call `GetFederationToken`. AWS allows the federated
    # user's request only when both the federated user <i> <b>and</b> </i>
    # the IAM user are explicitly allowed to perform the requested action.
    # The passed policy cannot grant more permissions than those that are
    # defined in the IAM user policy.
    #
    # A typical use case is that the permissions of the IAM user whose
    # credentials are used to call `GetFederationToken` are designed to
    # allow access to all the actions and resources that any federated user
    # will need. Then, for individual users, you pass a policy to the
    # operation that scopes down the permissions to a level that's
    # appropriate to that individual user, using a policy that allows only a
    # subset of permissions that are granted to the IAM user.
    #
    # If you do not pass a policy, the resulting temporary security
    # credentials have no effective permissions. The only exception is when
    # the temporary security credentials are used to access a resource that
    # has a resource-based policy that specifically allows the federated
    # user to access the resource.
    #
    # For more information about how permissions work, see [Permissions for
    # GetFederationToken][6]. For information about using
    # `GetFederationToken` to create temporary security credentials, see

    # @option params [required, String] :name

    #   can reference the federated user name in a resource-based policy, such
    #   as in an Amazon S3 bucket policy.
    #
    #   The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters

    #
    # @option params [String] :policy
    #   An IAM policy in JSON format that is passed with the
    #   `GetFederationToken` call and evaluated along with the policy or
    #   policies that are attached to the IAM user whose credentials are used
    #   to call `GetFederationToken`. The passed policy is used to scope down
    #   the permissions that are available to the IAM user, by allowing only a
    #   subset of the permissions that are granted to the IAM user. The passed
    #   policy cannot grant more permissions than those granted to the IAM
    #   user. The final permissions for the federated user are the most
    #   restrictive set based on the intersection of the passed policy and the
    #   IAM user policy.
    #
    #   If you do not pass a policy, the resulting temporary security
    #   credentials have no effective permissions. The only exception is when
    #   the temporary security credentials are used to access a resource that
    #   has a resource-based policy that specifically allows the federated
    #   user to access the resource.
    #
    #   The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a
    #   string of characters up to 2048 characters in length. The characters
    #   can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the
    #   valid character list (\\u0020-\\u00FF). It can also include the tab
    #   (\\u0009), linefeed (\\u000A), and carriage return (\\u000D)
    #   characters.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> The policy plain text must be 2048 bytes or shorter. However, an
    #   internal conversion compresses it into a packed binary format with a
    #   separate limit. The PackedPolicySize response element indicates by

    # Returns a set of temporary credentials for an AWS account or IAM user.
    # The credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and
    # a security token. Typically, you use `GetSessionToken` if you want to
    # use MFA to protect programmatic calls to specific AWS APIs like Amazon
    # EC2 `StopInstances`. MFA-enabled IAM users would need to call
    # `GetSessionToken` and submit an MFA code that is associated with their
    # MFA device. Using the temporary security credentials that are returned
    # from the call, IAM users can then make programmatic calls to APIs that
    # require MFA authentication. If you do not supply a correct MFA code,
    # then the API returns an access denied error. For a comparison of
    # `GetSessionToken` with the other APIs that produce temporary
    # credentials, see [Requesting Temporary Security Credentials][1] and
    # [Comparing the AWS STS APIs][2] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    # The `GetSessionToken` action must be called by using the long-term AWS
    # security credentials of the AWS account or an IAM user. Credentials
    # that are created by IAM users are valid for the duration that you
    # specify, from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129600
    # seconds (36 hours), with a default of 43200 seconds (12 hours);
    # credentials that are created by using account credentials can range
    # from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 3600 seconds (1
    # hour), with a default of 1 hour.
    #
    # The temporary security credentials created by `GetSessionToken` can be
    # used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following
    # exceptions:
    #
    # * You cannot call any IAM APIs unless MFA authentication information
    #   is included in the request.
    #
    # * You cannot call any STS API *except* `AssumeRole` or
    #   `GetCallerIdentity`.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> We recommend that you do not call `GetSessionToken` with root account
    # credentials. Instead, follow our [best practices][3] by creating one
    # or more IAM users, giving them the necessary permissions, and using
    # IAM users for everyday interaction with AWS.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # The permissions associated with the temporary security credentials
    # returned by `GetSessionToken` are based on the permissions associated
    # with account or IAM user whose credentials are used to call the
    # action. If `GetSessionToken` is called using root account credentials,
    # the temporary credentials have root account permissions. Similarly, if
    # `GetSessionToken` is called using the credentials of an IAM user, the
    # temporary credentials have the same permissions as the IAM user.
    #
    # For more information about using `GetSessionToken` to create temporary
    # credentials, go to [Temporary Credentials for Users in Untrusted
    # Environments][4] in the *IAM User Guide*.

    # @option params [Integer] :duration_seconds
    #   The duration, in seconds, that the credentials should remain valid.
    #   Acceptable durations for IAM user sessions range from 900 seconds (15
    #   minutes) to 129600 seconds (36 hours), with 43200 seconds (12 hours)
    #   as the default. Sessions for AWS account owners are restricted to a
    #   maximum of 3600 seconds (one hour). If the duration is longer than one
    #   hour, the session for AWS account owners defaults to one hour.
    #
    # @option params [String] :serial_number
    #   The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with
    #   the IAM user who is making the `GetSessionToken` call. Specify this
    #   value if the IAM user has a policy that requires MFA authentication.
    #   The value is either the serial number for a hardware device (such as
    #   `GAHT12345678`) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device
    #   (such as `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user`). You can find the
    #   device for an IAM user by going to the AWS Management Console and
    #   viewing the user's security credentials.
    #
    #   The regex used to validated this parameter is a string of characters
    #   consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
    #   spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
    #   characters: =,.@:/-
    #
    # @option params [String] :token_code
    #   The value provided by the MFA device, if MFA is required. If any
    #   policy requires the IAM user to submit an MFA code, specify this
    #   value. If MFA authentication is required, and the user does not
    #   provide a code when requesting a set of temporary security
    #   credentials, the user will receive an "access denied" response when
    #   requesting resources that require MFA authentication.
    #
    #   The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a
    #   sequence of six numeric digits.
