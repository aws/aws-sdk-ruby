module Aws
  # Decorates a {Seahorse::Client::Response} with paging convenience methods.
  # Some AWS calls provide paged responses to limit the amount of data returned
  # with each response. To optimize for latency, some APIs may return an
  # inconsistent number of responses per page. You should rely on the values of
  # the `next_page?` method or using enumerable methods such as `each` rather
  # than the number of items returned to iterate through results. See below for
  # examples.
  #
  # @note Methods such as `to_json` will enumerate all of the responses before
  #   returning the full response as JSON.
  #
  # # Paged Responses Are Enumerable
  # The simplest way to handle paged response data is to use the built-in
  # enumerator in the response object, as shown in the following example.
  #
  #     s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new
  #
  #     s3.list_objects(bucket:'aws-sdk').each do |response|
  #       puts response.contents.map(&:key)
  #     end
  #
  # This yields one response object per API call made, and enumerates objects
  # in the named bucket. The SDK retrieves additional pages of data to
  # complete the request.
  #
  # # Handling Paged Responses Manually
  # To handle paging yourself, use the responseâ€™s `next_page?` method to verify
  # there are more pages to retrieve, or use the last_page? method to verify
  # there are no more pages to retrieve.
  #
  # If there are more pages, use the `next_page` method to retrieve the
  # next page of results, as shown in the following example.
  #
  #     s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new
  #
  #     # Get the first page of data
  #     response = s3.list_objects(bucket:'aws-sdk')
  #
  #     # Get additional pages
  #     while response.next_page? do
  #       response = response.next_page
  #       # Use the response data here...
  #       puts response.contents.map(&:key)
  #     end
