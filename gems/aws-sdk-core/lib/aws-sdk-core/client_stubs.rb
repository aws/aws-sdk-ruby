    # Configures what data / errors should be returned from the named operation
    # when response stubbing is enabled.
    #
    # ## Basic usage
    #
    # When you enable response stubbing, the client will generate fake
    # responses and will not make any HTTP requests.
    #
    #     client = Aws::S3::Client.new(stub_responses: true)
    #     client.list_buckets
    #     #=> #<struct Aws::S3::Types::ListBucketsOutput buckets=[], owner=nil>
    #
    # You can provide stub data that will be returned by the client.
    #
    #     # stub data in the constructor
    #     client = Aws::S3::Client.new(stub_responses: {
    #       list_buckets: { buckets: [{name: 'my-bucket' }] },
    #       get_object: { body: 'data' },
    #     })
    #
    #     client.list_buckets.buckets.map(&:name) #=> ['my-bucket']
    #     client.get_object(bucket:'name', key:'key').body.read #=> 'data'
    #
    # You can also specify the stub data using {#stub_responses}
    #
    #     client = Aws::S3::Client.new(stub_responses: true)
    #     client.stub_responses(:list_buckets, {
    #       buckets: [{ name: 'my-bucket' }]
    #     })
    #
    #     client.list_buckets.buckets.map(&:name)
    #     #=> ['my-bucket']
    #
    # With a Resource class {#stub_responses} on the corresponding client:
    #
    #     s3 = Aws::S3::Resource.new(stub_responses: true)
    #     s3.client.stub_responses(:list_buckets, {
    #       buckets: [{ name: 'my-bucket' }]
    #     })
    #
    #     s3.buckets.map(&:name)
    #     #=> ['my-bucket']
    #
    # Lastly, default stubs can be configured via `Aws.config`:
    #
    #     Aws.config[:s3] = {
    #       stub_responses: {
    #         list_buckets: { buckets: [{name: 'my-bucket' }] }
    #       }
    #     }
    #
    #     Aws::S3::Client.new.list_buckets.buckets.map(&:name)
    #     #=> ['my-bucket']
    #
    #     Aws::S3::Resource.new.buckets.map(&:name)
    #     #=> ['my-bucket']
    #
    # ## Dynamic Stubbing
    #
    # In addition to creating static stubs, it's also possible to generate
    # stubs dynamically based on the parameters with which operations were
    # called, by passing a `Proc` object:
    #
    #     s3 = Aws::S3::Resource.new(stub_responses: true)
    #     s3.client.stub_responses(:put_object, -> (context) {
    #       s3.client.stub_responses(:get_object, content_type: context.params[:content_type])
    #     })
    #
    # The yielded object is an instance of {Seahorse::Client::RequestContext}.
    #
    # ## Stubbing Errors
    #
    # When stubbing is enabled, the SDK will default to generate
    # fake responses with placeholder values. You can override the data
    # returned. You can also specify errors it should raise.
    #
    #     # simulate service errors, give the error code
    #     client.stub_responses(:get_object, 'NotFound')
    #     client.get_object(bucket:'aws-sdk', key:'foo')
    #     #=> raises Aws::S3::Errors::NotFound
    #
    #     # to simulate other errors, give the error class, you must
    #     # be able to construct an instance with `.new`
    #     client.stub_responses(:get_object, Timeout::Error)
    #     client.get_object(bucket:'aws-sdk', key:'foo')
    #     #=> raises new Timeout::Error
    #
    #     # or you can give an instance of an error class
    #     client.stub_responses(:get_object, RuntimeError.new('custom message'))
    #     client.get_object(bucket:'aws-sdk', key:'foo')
    #     #=> raises the given runtime error object
    #
    # ## Stubbing HTTP Responses
    #
    # As an alternative to providing the response data, you can provide
    # an HTTP response.
    #
    #     client.stub_responses(:get_object, {
    #       status_code: 200,
    #       headers: { 'header-name' => 'header-value' },
    #       body: "...",
    #     })
    #
    # To stub a HTTP response, pass a Hash with all three of the following
    # keys set:
    #
    # * **`:status_code`** - <Integer> - The HTTP status code
    # * **`:headers`** - Hash<String,String> - A hash of HTTP header keys and values
    # * **`:body`** - <String,IO> - The HTTP response body.
    #
    # ## Stubbing Multiple Responses
    #
    # Calling an operation multiple times will return similar responses.
    # You can configure multiple stubs and they will be returned in sequence.
    #
    #     client.stub_responses(:head_object, [
    #       'NotFound',
    #       { content_length: 150 },
    #     ])
    #
    #     client.head_object(bucket:'aws-sdk', key:'foo')
    #     #=> raises Aws::S3::Errors::NotFound
    #
    #     resp = client.head_object(bucket:'aws-sdk', key:'foo')
    #     resp.content_length #=> 150
    #
    # @param [Symbol] operation_name

    # @param [Mixed] stubs One or more responses to return from the named

    #   on a client that has not enabled response stubbing via
