    #   the call succeeded on the server. If the HIT already exists in the

    #   can see the HIT in their search results), and

    #   different values for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the
    #   Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all
    #   QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the
    #   order of least restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview
    #   and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all
    #   QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept,
    #   but do not meet all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept,
