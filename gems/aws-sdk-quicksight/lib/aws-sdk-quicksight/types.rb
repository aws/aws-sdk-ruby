    #   A set of custom permissions includes any combination of these
    #   restrictions. Currently, you need to create the profile names for
    #   custom permission sets by using the Amazon QuickSight console. Then,
    #   you use the `RegisterUser` API operation to assign the named set of
    #   permissions to a Amazon QuickSight user.
    #
    #   Amazon QuickSight custom permissions are applied through IAM
    #   policies. Therefore, they override the permissions typically granted
    #   by assigning Amazon QuickSight users to one of the default security
    #   cohorts in Amazon QuickSight (admin, author, reader).

    #   operations:
    #
    #   * Create and update data sources
    #
    #   * Create and update datasets
    #
    #   * Create and update email reports
    #
    #   * Subscribe to email reports
    #
    #   A set of custom permissions includes any combination of these
    #   restrictions. Currently, you need to create the profile names for
    #   custom permission sets by using the Amazon QuickSight console. Then,
    #   you use the `RegisterUser` API operation to assign the named set of
    #   permissions to a Amazon QuickSight user.
    #
    #   Amazon QuickSight custom permissions are applied through IAM
    #   policies. Therefore, they override the permissions typically granted
    #   by assigning Amazon QuickSight users to one of the default security
    #   cohorts in Amazon QuickSight (admin, author, reader).

    #   A flag that you use to indicate that you want to remove all custom
    #   permissions from this user. Using this parameter resets the user to
    #   the state it was in before a custom permissions profile was applied.

    #   The type of supported external login provider that provides identity
    #   to let a user federate into Amazon QuickSight with an associated
    #   Identity and Access Management(IAM) role. The type of supported
    #   external login provider can be one of the following.
    #
    #   * `COGNITO`: Amazon Cognito. The provider URL is
    #     cognito-identity.amazonaws.com. When choosing the `COGNITO`
    #     provider type, don’t use the "CustomFederationProviderUrl"
    #     parameter which is only needed when the external provider is
    #     custom.
    #
    #   * `CUSTOM_OIDC`: Custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. When
    #     choosing `CUSTOM_OIDC` type, use the `CustomFederationProviderUrl`
    #     parameter to provide the custom OIDC provider URL.
    #
    #   * `NONE`: This clears all the previously saved external login
    #     information for a user. Use the ` DescribeUser ` API operation to
    #     check the external login information.
