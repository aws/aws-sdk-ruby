    #     detected on a document page.
    #
    #   * *WORD* - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or more
    #     ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't separated by
    #     spaces.
    #
    #   * *LINE* - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are
    #     detected on a document page.
    #
    #   In text analysis operations, the following types are returned:
    #
    #   * *PAGE* - Contains a list of child `Block` objects that are

    #     linked text that's detected on a document page. Use the
    #     `EntityType` field to determine if a KEY\_VALUE\_SET object is a
    #     KEY `Block` object or a VALUE `Block` object.
    #
    #   * *WORD* - A word that's detected on a document page. A word is one
    #     or more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't separated
    #     by spaces.
    #
    #   * *LINE* - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are
    #     detected on a document page.
    #
    #   * *TABLE* - A table that's detected on a document page. A table is
    #     grid-based information with two or more rows or columns, with a
    #     cell span of one row and one column each.
    #
    #   * *CELL* - A cell within a detected table. The cell is the parent of
    #     the block that contains the text in the cell.
    #
    #   * *SELECTION\_ELEMENT* - A selection element such as an option
    #     button (radio button) or a check box that's detected on a

    #   of text. There aren't Relationship objects in the list for

    #   The page on which a block was detected. `Page` is returned by

    #   returned for multipage documents that are in PDF or TIFF format. A
