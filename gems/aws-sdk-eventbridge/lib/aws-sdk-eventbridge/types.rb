    #   rules that may match undesirable events. To create more secure
    #   rules, make sure that the event pattern for each rule contains an

    #   [What Is AWS Organizations][1] in the *AWS Organizations User

    #   "*" as the value for `Principal`, you grant permission to all the
    #   accounts in the named organization.
    #
    #   The `Condition` is a JSON string which must contain `Type`, `Key`,
    #   and `Value` fields.
