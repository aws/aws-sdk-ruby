    # An Amazon Chime SDK meeting attendee. Includes a unique `AttendeeId`
    # and `JoinToken`. The `JoinToken` allows a client to authenticate and
    # join as the specified attendee. The `JoinToken` expires when the
    # meeting ends, or when DeleteAttendee is called. After that, the
    # attendee is unable to join the meeting.
    #
    # We recommend securely transferring each `JoinToken` from your server
    # application to the client so that no other client has access to the
    # token except for the one authorized to represent the attendee.
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] external_user_id
    #   The Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency token. Links
    #   the attendee to an identity managed by a builder application.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] attendee_id
    #   The Amazon Chime SDK attendee ID.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] join_token
    #   The join token used by the Amazon Chime SDK attendee.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] capabilities
    #   The capabilities assigned to an attendee: audio, video, or content.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> You use the capabilities with a set of values that control what the
    #   capabilities can do, such as `SendReceive` data. For more
    #   information about those values, see .
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   When using capabilities, be aware of these corner cases:
    #
    #   * You can't set `content` capabilities to `SendReceive` or
    #     `Receive` unless you also set `video` capabilities to
    #     `SendReceive` or `Receive`. If you don't set the `video`
    #     capability to receive, the response will contain an HTTP 400 Bad
    #     Request status code. However, you can set your `video` capability
    #     to receive and you set your `content` capability to not receive.
    #
    #   * When you change an `audio` capability from `None` or `Receive` to
    #     `Send` or `SendReceive` , and if the attendee left their
    #     microphone unmuted, audio will flow from the attendee to the other
    #     meeting participants.
    #
    #   * When you change a `video` or `content` capability from `None` or
    #     `Receive` to `Send` or `SendReceive` , and if the attendee turned
    #     on their video or content streams, remote attendess can receive
    #     those streams, but only after media renegotiation between the
    #     client and the Amazon Chime back-end server.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] tags
    #   Applies one or more tags to an Amazon Chime SDK meeting. Note the
    #   following:
    #
    #   * Not all resources have tags. For a list of services with resources
    #     that support tagging using this operation, see [Services that
    #     support the Resource Groups Tagging API][1]. If the resource
    #     doesn't yet support this operation, the resource's service might
    #     support tagging using its own API operations. For more
    #     information, refer to the documentation for that service.
    #
    #   * Each resource can have up to 50 tags. For other limits, see [Tag
    #     Naming and Usage Conventions][2] in the *AWS General Reference*.
    #
    #   * You can only tag resources that are located in the specified AWS
    #     Region for the AWS account.
    #
    #   * To add tags to a resource, you need the necessary permissions for
    #     the service that the resource belongs to as well as permissions
    #     for adding tags. For more information, see the documentation for
    #     each service.
    #
    #   Do not store personally identifiable information (PII) or other
    #   confidential or sensitive information in tags. We use tags to
    #   provide you with billing and administration services. Tags are not
    #   intended to be used for private or sensitive data.
    #
    #   **Minimum permissions**
    #
    #   In addition to the `tag:TagResources `permission required by this
    #   operation, you must also have the tagging permission defined by the
    #   service that created the resource. For example, to tag a
    #   `ChimeSDKMeetings` instance using the `TagResources` operation, you
    #   must have both of the following permissions:
    #
    #   `tag:TagResources`
    #
    #   `ChimeSDKMeetings:CreateTags`
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Some services might have specific requirements for tagging some
    #   resources. For example, to tag an Amazon S3 bucket, you must also
    #   have the `s3:GetBucketTagging` permission. If the expected minimum
    #   permissions don't work, check the documentation for that service's
    #   tagging APIs for more information.
