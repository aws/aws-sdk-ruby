    #   Do not include the container name in this path.

    #   If the path includes any folders that don't exist yet, the service

    #   then have two subfolders, `usa` and `canada`, in the `premium`
    #   folder.
    #
    #   There is no correlation between the path to the source and the path
    #   (folders) in the container in AWS Elemental MediaStore.
    #
    #   For more information about folders and how they exist in a
    #   container, see the [AWS Elemental MediaStore User Guide][1].
    #
    #   The file name is the name that is assigned to the file that you
