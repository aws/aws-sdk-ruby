    # @overload initialize(options)
    #   @param [Hash] options
    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading static credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleWebIdentityCredentials` - Used when you need to
    #       assume a role after providing credentials via the web.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SSOCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from AWS SSO using an
    #       access token generated from `aws login`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ProcessCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       process that outputs to stdout.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ECSCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from
    #       instances running in ECS.
    #
    #     * `Aws::CognitoIdentityCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from the Cognito Identity service.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2/ECS IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts
    #       are very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #       `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` or `Aws::ECSCredentials` to
    #       enable retries and extended timeouts.

    #     The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #     ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #     are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #     checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors, auth errors,
    #     endpoint discovery, and errors from expired credentials.
    #     This option is only used in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_max_delay (0)
    #     The maximum number of seconds to delay between retries (0 for no limit)
    #     used by the default backoff function. This option is only used in the
    #     `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :retry_mode ("legacy")
    #     Specifies which retry algorithm to use. Values are:

    #       unsuccessful retries a client can make.
    #
    #     * `adaptive` - An experimental retry mode that includes all the
    #       functionality of `standard` mode along with automatic client side
    #       throttling.  This is a provisional mode that may change behavior
    #       in the future.

    #     Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #     fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #     the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #     {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #     ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #     requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)

    #     seconds to wait when opening a HTTP session before raising a
    #     `Timeout::Error`.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :http_read_timeout (60) The default
    #     number of seconds to wait for response data.  This value can
    #     safely be set per-request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_idle_timeout (5) The number of
    #     seconds a connection is allowed to sit idle before it is
    #     considered stale.  Stale connections are closed and removed
    #     from the pool before making a request.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_continue_timeout (1) The number of
    #     seconds to wait for a 100-continue response before sending the
    #     request body.  This option has no effect unless the request has
    #     "Expect" header set to "100-continue".  Defaults to `nil` which
    #     disables this behaviour.  This value can safely be set per
    #     request on the session.

    # You call this operation to inform Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) that all
    # the archive parts have been uploaded and that Glacier can now assemble
    # the archive from the uploaded parts. After assembling and saving the
    # archive to the vault, Glacier returns the URI path of the newly
    # created archive resource. Using the URI path, you can then access the
    # archive. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID
    # returned to retrieve the archive at a later point. You can also get
    # the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For
    # more information, see InitiateJob.
    #
    # In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the
    # entire archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a
    # SHA256 tree hash, see [Computing Checksums][1]. On the server side,
    # Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree hash of the assembled archive.
    # If the values match, Glacier saves the archive to the vault;
    # otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The ListParts
    # operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific multipart
    # upload. It includes checksum information for each uploaded part that
    # can be used to debug a bad checksum issue.
    #
    # Additionally, Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when
    # assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Glacier
    # returns an error and the operation fails.
    #
    # Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first
    # successful complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again
    # within a short period, the operation will succeed and return the same
    # archive ID. This is useful in the event you experience a network issue
    # that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error, in
    # which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and
    # get the same archive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note,
    # however, that after the multipart upload completes, you cannot call
    # the List Parts operation and the multipart upload will not appear in
    # List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is
    # possible.
    #
    # An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations
    # (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users

    #
    # @option params [required, String] :vault_name
    #   The name of the vault.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :job_id
    #   The job ID whose data is downloaded.
    #
    # @option params [String] :range
    #   The range of bytes to retrieve from the output. For example, if you
    #   want to download the first 1,048,576 bytes, specify the range as
    #   `bytes=0-1048575`. By default, this operation downloads the entire
    #   output.
    #
    #   If the job output is large, then you can use a range to retrieve a
    #   portion of the output. This allows you to download the entire output
    #   in smaller chunks of bytes. For example, suppose you have 1 GB of job
    #   output you want to download and you decide to download 128 MB chunks
    #   of data at a time, which is a total of eight Get Job Output requests.
    #   You use the following process to download the job output:
    #
    #   1.  Download a 128 MB chunk of output by specifying the appropriate
    #       byte range. Verify that all 128 MB of data was received.
    #
    #   2.  Along with the data, the response includes a SHA256 tree hash of
    #       the payload. You compute the checksum of the payload on the client
    #       and compare it with the checksum you received in the response to
    #       ensure you received all the expected data.
    #
    #   3.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all the eight 128 MB chunks of output
    #       data, each time specifying the appropriate byte range.
    #
    #   4.  After downloading all the parts of the job output, you have a list
    #       of eight checksum values. Compute the tree hash of these values to
    #       find the checksum of the entire output. Using the DescribeJob API,
    #       obtain job information of the job that provided you the output.
    #       The response includes the checksum of the entire archive stored in
    #       Amazon S3 Glacier. You compare this value with the checksum you
    #       computed to ensure you have downloaded the entire archive content
    #       with no errors.

    # This operation initiates a multipart upload. Amazon S3 Glacier creates
    # a multipart upload resource and returns its ID in the response. The
    # multipart upload ID is used in subsequent requests to upload parts of
    # an archive (see UploadMultipartPart).
    #
    # When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in
    # number of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied
    # by a power of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304
    # (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is
    # 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB.
    #
    # Every part you upload to this resource (see UploadMultipartPart),
    # except the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the
    # same size or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2
    # MB file. If you initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4
    # MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> You don't need to know the size of the archive when you start a
    # multipart upload because Amazon S3 Glacier does not require you to
    # specify the overall archive size.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier)
    # removes the multipart upload resource referenced by the ID. Glacier
    # also removes the multipart upload resource if you cancel the multipart
    # upload or it may be removed if there is no activity for a period of 24
    # hours.
    #
    # An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations
    # (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users

    # This operation initiates the vault locking process by doing the
    # following:
    #
    # * Installing a vault lock policy on the specified vault.
    #
    # * Setting the lock state of vault lock to `InProgress`.
    #
    # * Returning a lock ID, which is used to complete the vault locking
    #   process.
    #
    # You can set one vault lock policy for each vault and this policy can
    # be up to 20 KB in size. For more information about vault lock
    # policies, see [Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock
    # Policies][1].
    #
    # You must complete the vault locking process within 24 hours after the
    # vault lock enters the `InProgress` state. After the 24 hour window
    # ends, the lock ID expires, the vault automatically exits the
    # `InProgress` state, and the vault lock policy is removed from the
    # vault. You call CompleteVaultLock to complete the vault locking
    # process by setting the state of the vault lock to `Locked`.
    #
    # After a vault lock is in the `Locked` state, you cannot initiate a new
    # vault lock for the vault.
    #
    # You can abort the vault locking process by calling AbortVaultLock. You
    # can get the state of the vault lock by calling GetVaultLock. For more
    # information about the vault locking process, [Amazon Glacier Vault
    # Lock][2].
    #
    # If this operation is called when the vault lock is in the `InProgress`
    # state, the operation returns an `AccessDeniedException` error. When
    # the vault lock is in the `InProgress` state you must call

    # This operation lists jobs for a vault, including jobs that are

    # operation returns a list of these jobs sorted by job initiation time.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> Amazon Glacier retains recently completed jobs for a period before
    # deleting them; however, it eventually removes completed jobs. The
    # output of completed jobs can be retrieved. Retaining completed jobs
    # for a period of time after they have completed enables you to get a
    # job output in the event you miss the job completion notification or
    # your first attempt to download it fails. For example, suppose you
    # start an archive retrieval job to download an archive. After the job

    # `Marker` field is set to a non-null value, which you can use to
    # continue the pagination of the list. To return a list of jobs that
    # begins at a specific job, set the marker request parameter to the
    # `Marker` value for that job that you obtained from a previous List
    # Jobs request.
    #
    # You can set a maximum limit for the number of jobs returned in the
    # response by specifying the `limit` parameter in the request. The
    # default limit is 50. The number of jobs returned might be fewer than
    # the limit, but the number of returned jobs never exceeds the limit.
    #
    # Additionally, you can filter the jobs list returned by specifying the
    # optional `statuscode` parameter or `completed` parameter, or both.
    # Using the `statuscode` parameter, you can specify to return only jobs
    # that match either the `InProgress`, `Succeeded`, or `Failed` status.
    # Using the `completed` parameter, you can specify to return only jobs
    # that were completed (`true`) or jobs that were not completed

    # This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads for the specified

    # been initiated by an InitiateMultipartUpload request, but has not yet
    # been completed or aborted. The list returned in the List Multipart
    # Upload response has no guaranteed order.
    #
    # The List Multipart Uploads operation supports pagination. By default,
    # this operation returns up to 50 multipart uploads in the response. You
    # should always check the response for a `marker` at which to continue
    # the list; if there are no more items the `marker` is `null`. To return
    # a list of multipart uploads that begins at a specific upload, set the
    # `marker` request parameter to the value you obtained from a previous
    # List Multipart Upload request. You can also limit the number of
    # uploads returned in the response by specifying the `limit` parameter
    # in the request.
    #
    # Note the difference between this operation and listing parts
    # (ListParts). The List Multipart Uploads operation lists all multipart
    # uploads for a vault and does not require a multipart upload ID. The
    # List Parts operation requires a multipart upload ID since parts are
    # associated with a single upload.
    #
    # An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations
    # (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users
    # don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit
    # permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see

    #
    # * **SHA256 tree hash does not match**To ensure that part data is not
    #   corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the
    #   part and include it in your request. Upon receiving the part data,

    #   values don't match, the operation fails. For information about
    #   computing a SHA256 tree hash, see [Computing Checksums][1].
    #
    # * **Part size does not match**The size of each part except the last
    #   must match the size specified in the corresponding
    #   InitiateMultipartUpload request. The size of the last part must be
    #   the same size as, or smaller than, the specified size.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you
    #   specified in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is
    #   not the last part, then the upload part request will succeed.
    #   However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    # * **Range does not align**The byte range value in the request does not
    #   align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate
    #   request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4
    #   MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to
    #   8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part ranges. However, if you set a
    #   range value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align with the part
    #   size and the upload will fail.
    #
    # This operation is idempotent. If you upload the same part multiple
    # times, the data included in the most recent request overwrites the
    # previously uploaded data.
    #
    # An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations
    # (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users
    # don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit
    # permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see
    # [Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)][2].

    # Large Archives in Parts (Multipart Upload)][3] and [Upload Part ][4]

    # @option params [required, String] :account_id
    #   The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns
    #   the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a
    #   single '`-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS
    #   account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
    #   If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the

    # Polls an API operation until a resource enters a desired state.
    #
    # ## Basic Usage
    #
    # A waiter will call an API operation until:
    #
    # * It is successful
    # * It enters a terminal state
    # * It makes the maximum number of attempts
    #
    # In between attempts, the waiter will sleep.
    #
    #     # polls in a loop, sleeping between attempts
    #     client.wait_until(waiter_name, params)
    #
    # ## Configuration
    #
    # You can configure the maximum number of polling attempts, and the
    # delay (in seconds) between each polling attempt. You can pass
    # configuration as the final arguments hash.
    #
    #     # poll for ~25 seconds
    #     client.wait_until(waiter_name, params, {
    #       max_attempts: 5,
    #       delay: 5,
    #     })
    #
    # ## Callbacks
    #
    # You can be notified before each polling attempt and before each
    # delay. If you throw `:success` or `:failure` from these callbacks,
    # it will terminate the waiter.
    #
    #     started_at = Time.now
    #     client.wait_until(waiter_name, params, {
    #
    #       # disable max attempts
    #       max_attempts: nil,
    #
    #       # poll for 1 hour, instead of a number of attempts
    #       before_wait: -> (attempts, response) do
    #         throw :failure if Time.now - started_at > 3600
    #       end
    #     })
    #
    # ## Handling Errors
    #
    # When a waiter is unsuccessful, it will raise an error.
    # All of the failure errors extend from
    # {Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed}.
    #
    #     begin
    #       client.wait_until(...)
    #     rescue Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed
    #       # resource did not enter the desired state in time
    #     end
    #
    # ## Valid Waiters
    #
    # The following table lists the valid waiter names, the operations they call,
    # and the default `:delay` and `:max_attempts` values.
    #
    # | waiter_name      | params                  | :delay   | :max_attempts |
    # | ---------------- | ----------------------- | -------- | ------------- |
    # | vault_exists     | {Client#describe_vault} | 3        | 15            |
    # | vault_not_exists | {Client#describe_vault} | 3        | 15            |
    #
