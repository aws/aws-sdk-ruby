    #       byte range. Verify that all 128 MB of data was received.

    #       the payload. You compute the checksum of the payload on the
    #       client and compare it with the checksum you received in the
    #       response to ensure you received all the expected data.
    #

    #   4.  After downloading all the parts of the job output, you have a
    #       list of eight checksum values. Compute the tree hash of these
    #       values to find the checksum of the entire output. Using the
    #       DescribeJob API, obtain job information of the job that provided
