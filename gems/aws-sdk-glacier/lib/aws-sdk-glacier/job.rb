    # @deprecated Use [Aws::Glacier::Client] #wait_until instead
    #
    # Waiter polls an API operation until a resource enters a desired
    # state.
    #
    # @note The waiting operation is performed on a copy. The original resource
    #   remains unchanged.
    #
    # ## Basic Usage
    #
    # Waiter will polls until it is successful, it fails by
    # entering a terminal state, or until a maximum number of attempts
    # are made.
    #
    #     # polls in a loop until condition is true
    #     resource.wait_until(options) {|resource| condition}
    #
    # ## Example
    #
    #     instance.wait_until(max_attempts:10, delay:5) do |instance|
    #       instance.state.name == 'running'
    #     end
    #
    # ## Configuration
    #
    # You can configure the maximum number of polling attempts, and the
    # delay (in seconds) between each polling attempt. The waiting condition is
    # set by passing a block to {#wait_until}:
    #
    #     # poll for ~25 seconds
    #     resource.wait_until(max_attempts:5,delay:5) {|resource|...}
    #
    # ## Callbacks
    #
    # You can be notified before each polling attempt and before each
    # delay. If you throw `:success` or `:failure` from these callbacks,
    # it will terminate the waiter.
    #
    #     started_at = Time.now
    #     # poll for 1 hour, instead of a number of attempts
    #     proc = Proc.new do |attempts, response|
    #       throw :failure if Time.now - started_at > 3600
    #     end
    #
    #       # disable max attempts
    #     instance.wait_until(before_wait:proc, max_attempts:nil) {...}
    #
    # ## Handling Errors
    #
    # When a waiter is successful, it returns the Resource. When a waiter
    # fails, it raises an error.
    #
    #     begin
    #       resource.wait_until(...)
    #     rescue Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed
    #       # resource did not enter the desired state in time
    #     end
    #

    #   terminates because the waiter has entered a state that it will not
    #   transition out of, preventing success.

    #

    #   job.get_output({
    #     range: "string",
    #   })
    # @param [Hash] options ({})
    # @option options [String] :range
    #   The range of bytes to retrieve from the output. For example, if you
    #   want to download the first 1,048,576 bytes, specify the range as
    #   `bytes=0-1048575`. By default, this operation downloads the entire
    #   output.
    #
    #   If the job output is large, then you can use a range to retrieve a
    #   portion of the output. This allows you to download the entire output
    #   in smaller chunks of bytes. For example, suppose you have 1 GB of job
    #   output you want to download and you decide to download 128 MB chunks
    #   of data at a time, which is a total of eight Get Job Output requests.
    #   You use the following process to download the job output:
    #
    #   1.  Download a 128 MB chunk of output by specifying the appropriate
    #       byte range. Verify that all 128 MB of data was received.
    #
    #   2.  Along with the data, the response includes a SHA256 tree hash of
    #       the payload. You compute the checksum of the payload on the client
    #       and compare it with the checksum you received in the response to
    #       ensure you received all the expected data.
    #
    #   3.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all the eight 128 MB chunks of output
    #       data, each time specifying the appropriate byte range.
    #
    #   4.  After downloading all the parts of the job output, you have a list
    #       of eight checksum values. Compute the tree hash of these values to
    #       find the checksum of the entire output. Using the DescribeJob API,
    #       obtain job information of the job that provided you the output.
    #       The response includes the checksum of the entire archive stored in
    #       Amazon S3 Glacier. You compare this value with the checksum you
    #       computed to ensure you have downloaded the entire archive content
    #       with no errors.
