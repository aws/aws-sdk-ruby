    #
    #     To use a specific version of a WAF managed rule group in your
    #     Firewall Manager policy, you must set `versionEnabled` to `true`,
    #     and set `version` to the version you'd like to use. If you don't
    #     set `versionEnabled` to `true`, or if you omit `versionEnabled`,
    #     then Firewall Manager uses the default version of the WAF managed
    #     rule group.
    #
    #   * Example: `SECURITY_GROUPS_COMMON`
    #
    #     `"\{"type":"SECURITY_GROUPS_COMMON","revertManualSecurityGroupChanges":false,"exclusiveResourceSecurityGroupManagement":false,
    #     "applyToAllEC2InstanceENIs":false,"securityGroups":[\{"id":"

    #
    #     Firewall Manager automatically distributes tags from the primary
    #     group to the security groups created by this policy. To use
    #     security group tag distribution, you must also set
    #     `revertManualSecurityGroupChanges` to `true`, otherwise Firewall
    #     Manager won't be able to create the policy. When you enable
    #     `revertManualSecurityGroupChanges`, Firewall Manager identifies
    #     and reports when the security groups created by this policy become
    #     non-compliant.
    #
    #     Firewall Manager won't distrubute system tags added by Amazon Web
    #     Services services into the replica security groups. System tags
    #     begin with the `aws:` prefix.
    #
    #   * Example: Shared VPCs. Apply the preceding policy to resources in
    #     shared VPCs as well as to those in VPCs that the account owns
    #
    #     `"\{"type":"SECURITY_GROUPS_COMMON","revertManualSecurityGroupChanges":false,"exclusiveResourceSecurityGroupManagement":false,
    #     "applyToAllEC2InstanceENIs":false,"includeSharedVPC":true,"securityGroups":[\{"id":"

    #     `"\{"type":"SECURITY_GROUPS_CONTENT_AUDIT","securityGroups":[\{"id":"sg-000e55995d61a06bd"\}],"securityGroupAction":\{"type":"ALLOW"\}\}"`
    #
    #     The security group action for content audit can be `ALLOW` or
    #     `DENY`. For `ALLOW`, all in-scope security group rules must be
    #     within the allowed range of the policy's security group rules.
    #     For `DENY`, all in-scope security group rules must not contain a
    #     value or a range that matches a rule value or range in the policy
    #     security group.
    #
    #   * Example: `SECURITY_GROUPS_USAGE_AUDIT`
    #
    #     `"\{"type":"SECURITY_GROUPS_USAGE_AUDIT","deleteUnusedSecurityGroups":true,"coalesceRedundantSecurityGroups":true\}"`
