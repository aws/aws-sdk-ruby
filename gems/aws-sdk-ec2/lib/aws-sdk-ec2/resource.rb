    #   is specified, the encrypted state must be `true`.
    #
    #   You can specify the CMK using any of the following:
    #
    #   * Key ID. For example, key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
    #
    #   * Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.

    #
    #   * Alias ARN. For example,
    #     arn:aws:kms:*us-east-1*\:*012345678910*\:alias/*ExampleAlias*.
    #
    #   AWS authenticates the CMK asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an

    #   complete, but eventually fails.
