    # @deprecated Use [Aws::EC2::Client] #wait_until instead
    #
    # Waiter polls an API operation until a resource enters a desired
    # state.
    #
    # @note The waiting operation is performed on a copy. The original resource
    #   remains unchanged.
    #
    # ## Basic Usage
    #
    # Waiter will polls until it is successful, it fails by
    # entering a terminal state, or until a maximum number of attempts
    # are made.
    #
    #     # polls in a loop until condition is true
    #     resource.wait_until(options) {|resource| condition}
    #
    # ## Example
    #
    #     instance.wait_until(max_attempts:10, delay:5) do |instance|
    #       instance.state.name == 'running'
    #     end
    #
    # ## Configuration
    #
    # You can configure the maximum number of polling attempts, and the
    # delay (in seconds) between each polling attempt. The waiting condition is
    # set by passing a block to {#wait_until}:
    #
    #     # poll for ~25 seconds
    #     resource.wait_until(max_attempts:5,delay:5) {|resource|...}
    #
    # ## Callbacks
    #
    # You can be notified before each polling attempt and before each
    # delay. If you throw `:success` or `:failure` from these callbacks,
    # it will terminate the waiter.
    #
    #     started_at = Time.now
    #     # poll for 1 hour, instead of a number of attempts
    #     proc = Proc.new do |attempts, response|
    #       throw :failure if Time.now - started_at > 3600
    #     end
    #
    #       # disable max attempts
    #     instance.wait_until(before_wait:proc, max_attempts:nil) {...}
    #
    # ## Handling Errors
    #
    # When a waiter is successful, it returns the Resource. When a waiter
    # fails, it raises an error.
    #
    #     begin
    #       resource.wait_until(...)
    #     rescue Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed
    #       # resource did not enter the desired state in time
    #     end
    #
    # @yieldparam [Resource] resource to be used in the waiting condition.
    #
    # @raise [Aws::Waiters::Errors::FailureStateError] Raised when the waiter
    #   terminates because the waiter has entered a state that it will not
    #   transition out of, preventing success.
    #
    #   yet successful.
    #
    # @raise [Aws::Waiters::Errors::UnexpectedError] Raised when an error is
    #   encountered while polling for a resource that is not expected.
    #
    # @raise [NotImplementedError] Raised when the resource does not
    #
    # @option options [Integer] :max_attempts (10) Maximum number of
    # attempts
    # @option options [Integer] :delay (10) Delay between each
    # attempt in seconds
    # @option options [Proc] :before_attempt (nil) Callback
    # invoked before each attempt
    # @option options [Proc] :before_wait (nil) Callback
    # invoked before each wait
    # @return [Resource] if the waiter was successful

    #     translation (NAT) in your VPC.
    #
    #   * `spot-instance-request-id` - The ID of the Spot Instance request.
    #
    #   * `state-reason-code` - The reason code for the state change.

    #
    #   * `tag`\:&lt;key&gt; - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to

    #     for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.
    #
    #   * `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this
    #     filter to find all resources that have a tag with a specific key,
