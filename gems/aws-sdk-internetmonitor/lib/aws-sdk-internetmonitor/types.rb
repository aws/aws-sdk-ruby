    # Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor calculates measurements about the
    # availability for your application's internet traffic between client
    # locations and Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services has substantial
    # historical data about internet performance and availability between
    # Amazon Web Services services and different network providers and
    # geographies. By applying statistical analysis to the data, Internet
    # Monitor can detect when the performance and availability for your
    # application has dropped, compared to an estimated baseline that's
    # already calculated. To make it easier to see those drops, we report
    # that information to you in the form of health scores: a performance
    # score and an availability score.
    #
    # Availability in Internet Monitor represents the estimated percentage
    # of traffic that is not seeing an availability drop. For example, an
    # availability score of 99% for an end user and service location pair is
    # equivalent to 1% of the traffic experiencing an availability drop for
    # that pair.
    #
    # For more information, see [How Internet Monitor calculates performance
    # and availability scores][1] in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor
    # section of the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

    # @!attribute [rw] experience_score
    #   Experience scores, or health scores are calculated for different
    #   geographic and network provider combinations (that is, different
    #   granularities) and also summed into global scores. If you view
    #   performance or availability scores without filtering for any
    #   specific geography or service provider, Amazon CloudWatch Internet
    #   Monitor provides global health scores.
    #
    #   The Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor chapter in the *CloudWatch
    #   User Guide* includes detailed information about how Internet Monitor
    #   calculates health scores, including performance and availability
    #   scores, and when it creates and resolves health events. For more
    #   information, see [How Amazon Web Services calculates performance and
    #   availability scores][1] in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor

    # Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor calculates measurements about the
    # performance for your application's internet traffic between client
    # locations and Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services has substantial
    # historical data about internet performance and availability between
    # Amazon Web Services services and different network providers and
    # geographies. By applying statistical analysis to the data, Internet
    # Monitor can detect when the performance and availability for your
    # application has dropped, compared to an estimated baseline that's
    # already calculated. To make it easier to see those drops, we report
    # that information to you in the form of health scores: a performance
    # score and an availability score.
    #
    # Performance in Internet Monitor represents the estimated percentage of
    # traffic that is not seeing a performance drop. For example, a
    # performance score of 99% for an end user and service location pair is
    # equivalent to 1% of the traffic experiencing a performance drop for
    # that pair.

    #   specific geography or service provider, Amazon CloudWatch Internet
    #   Monitor provides global health scores.
