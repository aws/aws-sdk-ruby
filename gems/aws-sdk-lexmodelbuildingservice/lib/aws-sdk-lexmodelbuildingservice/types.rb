    # limit the client-side code primarily to presentation. If you need to

    #
    # * In a pizza ordering application, after the user provides all of the
    #   information for placing an order, you use a Lambda function to place
    #   an order with a pizzeria.
    #
    # * In a gaming application, when a user says "pick up a rock," this
    #   information must go back to the client application so that it can
    #   perform the operation and update the graphics. In this case, you
    #   want Amazon Lex to return the intent data to the client.

    # @!attribute [rw] name
    #   The name of the bot. The name is *not* case sensitive.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] description
    #   A description of the bot.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] intents
    #   An array of `Intent` objects. Each intent represents a command that
    #   a user can express. For example, a pizza ordering bot might support
    #   an OrderPizza intent. For more information, see how-it-works.
    #   @return [Array<Types::Intent>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] clarification_prompt
    #   When Amazon Lex doesn't understand the user's intent, it uses this
    #   message to get clarification. To specify how many times Amazon Lex
    #   should repeate the clarification prompt, use the `maxAttempts`
    #   field. If Amazon Lex still doesn't understand, it sends the message
    #   in the `abortStatement` field.
    #
    #   When you create a clarification prompt, make sure that it suggests
    #   the correct response from the user. for example, for a bot that
    #   orders pizza and drinks, you might create this clarification prompt:
    #   "What would you like to do? You can say 'Order a pizza' or
    #   'Order a drink.'"
    #   @return [Types::Prompt]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] abort_statement
    #   When Amazon Lex can't understand the user's input in context, it
    #   tries to elicit the information a few times. After that, Amazon Lex
    #   sends the message defined in `abortStatement` to the user, and then
    #   aborts the conversation. To set the number of retries, use the
    #   `valueElicitationPrompt` field for the slot type.
    #
    #   For example, in a pizza ordering bot, Amazon Lex might ask a user
    #   "What type of crust would you like?" If the user's response is
    #   not one of the expected responses (for example, "thin crust, "deep
    #   dish," etc.), Amazon Lex tries to elicit a correct response a few
    #   more times.
    #
    #   For example, in a pizza ordering application, `OrderPizza` might be
    #   one of the intents. This intent might require the `CrustType` slot.
    #   You specify the `valueElicitationPrompt` field when you create the
    #   `CrustType` slot.
    #   @return [Types::Statement]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] idle_session_ttl_in_seconds
    #   The maximum time in seconds that Amazon Lex retains the data
    #   gathered in a conversation.
    #
    #   A user interaction session remains active for the amount of time
    #   specified. If no conversation occurs during this time, the session
    #   expires and Amazon Lex deletes any data provided before the timeout.
    #
    #   For example, suppose that a user chooses the OrderPizza intent, but
    #   gets sidetracked halfway through placing an order. If the user
    #   doesn't complete the order within the specified time, Amazon Lex
    #   discards the slot information that it gathered, and the user must
    #   start over.
    #
    #   If you don't include the `idleSessionTTLInSeconds` element in a
    #   `PutBot` operation request, Amazon Lex uses the default value. This
    #   is also true if the request replaces an existing bot.
    #
    #   The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] voice_id
    #   The Amazon Polly voice ID that you want Amazon Lex to use for voice
    #   interactions with the user. The locale configured for the voice must
    #   match the locale of the bot. For more information, see [Available
    #   Voices][1] in the *Amazon Polly Developer Guide*.

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] checksum
    #   Identifies a specific revision of the `$LATEST` version.
    #
    #   When you create a new bot, leave the `checksum` field blank. If you
    #   specify a checksum you get a `BadRequestException` exception.
    #
    #   When you want to update a bot, set the `checksum` field to the
    #   checksum of the most recent revision of the `$LATEST` version. If
    #   you don't specify the ` checksum` field, or if the checksum does
    #   not match the `$LATEST` version, you get a
    #   `PreconditionFailedException` exception.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] process_behavior
    #   If you set the `processBehavior` element to `Build`, Amazon Lex
    #   builds the bot so that it can be run. If you set the element to
    #   `Save`Amazon Lex saves the bot, but doesn't build it.
    #
    #   If you don't specify this value, the default value is `Save`.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] locale
    #   Specifies the target locale for the bot. Any intent used in the bot
    #   must be compatible with the locale of the bot.
    #
    #   The default is `en-US`.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] child_directed
    #   For each Amazon Lex bot created with the Amazon Lex Model Building
    #   Service, you must specify whether your use of Amazon Lex is related
    #   to a website, program, or other application that is directed or
    #   targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject
    #   to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by
    #   specifying `true` or `false` in the `childDirected` field. By
    #   specifying `true` in the `childDirected` field, you confirm that
    #   your use of Amazon Lex **is** related to a website, program, or
    #   other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part,
    #   to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. By specifying `false`
    #   in the `childDirected` field, you confirm that your use of Amazon
    #   Lex **is not** related to a website, program, or other application
    #   that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under
    #   age 13 and subject to COPPA. You may not specify a default value for
    #   the `childDirected` field that does not accurately reflect whether
    #   your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other
    #   application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to
    #   children under age 13 and subject to COPPA.

    #   name with "AMAZON." removed. For example, because there is a

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] slots
    #   An array of intent slots. At runtime, Amazon Lex elicits required

    #   more information, see how-it-works.
    #   @return [Array<Types::Slot>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] sample_utterances
    #   An array of utterances (strings) that a user might say to signal the
    #   intent. For example, "I want \\\{PizzaSize\\} pizza", "Order
    #   \\\{Quantity\\} \\\{PizzaSize\\} pizzas".
    #
    #   In each utterance, a slot name is enclosed in curly braces.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] confirmation_prompt
    #   Prompts the user to confirm the intent. This question should have a
    #   yes or no answer.
    #
    #   Amazon Lex uses this prompt to ensure that the user acknowledges
    #   that the intent is ready for fulfillment. For example, with the
    #   `OrderPizza` intent, you might want to confirm that the order is
    #   correct before placing it. For other intents, such as intents that
    #   simply respond to user questions, you might not need to ask the user
    #   for confirmation before providing the information.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> You you must provide both the `rejectionStatement` and the
    #   `confirmationPrompt`, or neither.
    #
    #    </note>
    #   @return [Types::Prompt]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] rejection_statement
    #   When the user answers "no" to the question defined in

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] follow_up_prompt
    #   Amazon Lex uses this prompt to solicit additional activity after
    #   fulfilling an intent. For example, after the `OrderPizza` intent is
    #   fulfilled, you might prompt the user to order a drink.
    #
    #   The action that Amazon Lex takes depends on the user's response, as
    #   follows:
    #
    #   * If the user says "Yes" it responds with the clarification prompt
    #     that is configured for the bot.
    #
    #   * if the user says "Yes" and continues with an utterance that
    #     triggers an intent it starts a conversation for the intent.
    #
    #   * If the user says "No" it responds with the rejection statement
    #     configured for the the follow-up prompt.
    #
    #   * If it doesn't recognize the utterance it repeats the follow-up
    #     prompt again.
    #
    #   The `followUpPrompt` field and the `conclusionStatement` field are
    #   mutually exclusive. You can specify only one.
    #   @return [Types::FollowUpPrompt]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] conclusion_statement
    #   The statement that you want Amazon Lex to convey to the user after
    #   the intent is successfully fulfilled by the Lambda function.
    #
    #   This element is relevant only if you provide a Lambda function in
    #   the `fulfillmentActivity`. If you return the intent to the client
    #   application, you can't specify this element.
    #

    #   @return [Types::Statement]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] dialog_code_hook
    #   Specifies a Lambda function to invoke for each user input. You can
    #   invoke this Lambda function to personalize user interaction.
    #
    #   For example, suppose your bot determines that the user is John. Your
    #   Lambda function might retrieve John's information from a backend
    #   database and prepopulate some of the values. For example, if you
    #   find that John is gluten intolerant, you might set the corresponding
    #   intent slot, `GlutenIntolerant`, to true. You might find John's
    #   phone number and set the corresponding session attribute.
    #   @return [Types::CodeHook]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] fulfillment_activity
    #   Required. Describes how the intent is fulfilled. For example, after
    #   a user provides all of the information for a pizza order,
    #   `fulfillmentActivity` defines how the bot places an order with a
    #   local pizza store.
    #
    #   You might configure Amazon Lex to return all of the intent
    #   information to the client application, or direct it to invoke a
    #   Lambda function that can process the intent (for example, place an
    #   order with a pizzeria).
    #   @return [Types::FulfillmentActivity]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] parent_intent_signature
    #   A unique identifier for the built-in intent to base this intent on.
