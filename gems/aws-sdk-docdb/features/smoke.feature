Feature: Smoke tests for DocDB

Background:
  Given I create a client in region 'us-west-2'

  @docdb @smoke
  Scenario: Call Aws::DocDB::Client#describe_db_engine_versions and expect it to succeed
  When I call the operation 'describe_db_engine_versions' with params:
    """
{}
    """
  Then I expect an error was not raised

  @docdb @smoke
  Scenario: Call Aws::Aws::DocDB::Client#describe_db_instances and expect it to fail
  When I call the operation 'describe_db_instances' with params:
    """
{"db_instance_identifier":"fake-id"}
    """
  Then I expect an error was raised
