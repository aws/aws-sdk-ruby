    #   (Optional) The path to the Amazon S3 bucket (including the optional
    #   prefix) that you're using as the data repository for your Amazon
    #   FSx for Lustre file system. The root of your FSx for Lustre file
    #   system will be mapped to the root of the Amazon S3 bucket you
    #   select. An example is `s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix`. If you
    #   specify a prefix after the Amazon S3 bucket name, only object keys
    #   with that prefix are loaded into the file system.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] export_path
    #   (Optional) The path in Amazon S3 where the root of your Amazon FSx
    #   file system is exported. The path must use the same Amazon S3 bucket
    #   as specified in ImportPath. You can provide an optional prefix to
    #   which new and changed data is to be exported from your Amazon FSx
    #   for Lustre file system. If an `ExportPath` value is not provided,
    #   Amazon FSx sets a default export path,
    #   `s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre[creation-timestamp]`. The timestamp is
    #   in UTC format, for example
    #   `s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre20181105T222312Z`.
    #
    #   The Amazon S3 export bucket must be the same as the import bucket
    #   specified by `ImportPath`. If you only specify a bucket name, such
    #   as `s3://import-bucket`, you get a 1:1 mapping of file system
    #   objects to S3 bucket objects. This mapping means that the input data
    #   in S3 is overwritten on export. If you provide a custom prefix in
    #   the export path, such as
    #   `s3://import-bucket/[custom-optional-prefix]`, Amazon FSx exports
    #   the contents of your file system to that export prefix in the Amazon
    #   S3 bucket.

    # @!attribute [rw] imported_file_chunk_size
    #   (Optional) For files imported from a data repository, this value
    #   determines the stripe count and maximum amount of data per file (in
    #   MiB) stored on a single physical disk. The maximum number of disks
    #   that a single file can be striped across is limited by the total
    #   number of disks that make up the file system.
    #
    #   The chunk size default is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as
