    # Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative action for the current
    # Windows, Lustre, OpenZFS, or ONTAP file system or volume.
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] administrative_action_type
    #   Describes the type of administrative action, as follows:
    #
    #   * `FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE` - A file system update administrative action
    #     initiated from the Amazon FSx console, API (`UpdateFileSystem`),
    #     or CLI (`update-file-system`).
    #
    #   * `THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION` - After the `FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE` task to
    #     increase a file system's throughput capacity has been completed
    #     successfully, a `THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION` task starts.
    #
    #     You can track the storage-optimization progress using the
    #     `ProgressPercent` property. When `THROUGHPUT_OPTIMIZATION` has
    #     been completed successfully, the parent `FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE`
    #     action status changes to `COMPLETED`. For more information, see
    #     [Managing throughput capacity][1] in the *Amazon FSx for Windows
    #     File Server User Guide*.
    #
    #   * `STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION` - After the `FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE` task to
    #     increase a file system's storage capacity has been completed
    #     successfully, a `STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION` task starts.
    #
    #     * For Windows and ONTAP, storage optimization is the process of
    #       migrating the file system data to newer larger disks.
    #
    #     * For Lustre, storage optimization consists of rebalancing the
    #       data across the existing and newly added file servers.
    #
    #     You can track the storage-optimization progress using the
    #     `ProgressPercent` property. When `STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION` has been
    #     completed successfully, the parent `FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE` action
    #     status changes to `COMPLETED`. For more information, see [Managing
    #     storage capacity][2] in the *Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
    #     User Guide*, [Managing storage capacity][3] in the *Amazon FSx for
    #     Lustre User Guide*, and [Managing storage capacity and provisioned
    #     IOPS][4] in the *Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide*.
    #
    #   * `FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_ASSOCIATION` - A file system update to
    #     associate a new Domain Name System (DNS) alias with the file
    #     system. For more information, see [
    #     AssociateFileSystemAliases][5].
    #
    #   * `FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_DISASSOCIATION` - A file system update to
    #     disassociate a DNS alias from the file system. For more
    #     information, see [DisassociateFileSystemAliases][6].
    #
    #   * `IOPS_OPTIMIZATION` - After the `FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE` task to
    #     increase a file system's throughput capacity has been completed
    #     successfully, a `IOPS_OPTIMIZATION` task starts.
    #
    #     You can track the storage-optimization progress using the
    #     `ProgressPercent` property. When `IOPS_OPTIMIZATION` has been
    #     completed successfully, the parent `FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE` action
    #     status changes to `COMPLETED`. For more information, see [Managing
    #     provisioned SSD IOPS][7] in the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
    #     User Guide.
    #
    #   * `STORAGE_TYPE_OPTIMIZATION` - After the `FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE` task
    #     to increase a file system's throughput capacity has been
    #     completed successfully, a `STORAGE_TYPE_OPTIMIZATION` task starts.
    #
    #     You can track the storage-optimization progress using the
    #     `ProgressPercent` property. When `STORAGE_TYPE_OPTIMIZATION` has
    #     been completed successfully, the parent `FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE`
    #     action status changes to `COMPLETED`.
    #
    #   * `VOLUME_UPDATE` - A volume update to an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS
    #     volume initiated from the Amazon FSx console, API
    #     (`UpdateVolume`), or CLI (`update-volume`).
    #
    #   * `VOLUME_RESTORE` - An Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume is returned to
    #     the state saved by the specified snapshot, initiated from an API
    #     (`RestoreVolumeFromSnapshot`) or CLI
    #     (`restore-volume-from-snapshot`).
    #
    #   * `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE` - A snapshot update to an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS
    #     volume initiated from the Amazon FSx console, API
    #     (`UpdateSnapshot`), or CLI (`update-snapshot`).
    #
    #   * `RELEASE_NFS_V3_LOCKS` - Tracks the release of Network File System
    #     (NFS) V3 locks on an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system.
    #
    #   * `VOLUME_INITIALIZE_WITH_SNAPSHOT` - A volume is being created from
    #     a snapshot on a different FSx for OpenZFS file system. You can
    #     initiate this from the Amazon FSx console, API (`CreateVolume`),
    #     or CLI (`create-volume`) when using the using the `FULL_COPY`
    #     strategy.
    #
    #   * `VOLUME_UPDATE_WITH_SNAPSHOT` - A volume is being updated from a
    #     snapshot on a different FSx for OpenZFS file system. You can
    #     initiate this from the Amazon FSx console, API
    #     (`CopySnapshotAndUpdateVolume`), or CLI

    #   (Optional) Specifies the path in the Amazon S3 bucket where the root
    #   of your Amazon FSx file system is exported. The path must use the
    #   same Amazon S3 bucket as specified in ImportPath. You can provide an
    #   optional prefix to which new and changed data is to be exported from
    #   your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. If an `ExportPath` value is
    #   not provided, Amazon FSx sets a default export path,
    #   `s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre[creation-timestamp]`. The timestamp is
    #   in UTC format, for example
    #   `s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre20181105T222312Z`.

    #   as `s3://import-bucket`, you get a 1:1 mapping of file system
    #   objects to S3 bucket objects. This mapping means that the input data
    #   in S3 is overwritten on export. If you provide a custom prefix in
    #   the export path, such as
    #   `s3://import-bucket/[custom-optional-prefix]`, Amazon FSx exports
    #   the contents of your file system to that export prefix in the Amazon

    # @!attribute [rw] aliases
    #   An array of one or more DNS alias names that you want to associate

    #   DNS names to access the data in your Amazon FSx file system. You can
    #   associate up to 50 aliases with a file system at any time. You can
    #   associate additional DNS aliases after you create the file system
    #   using the AssociateFileSystemAliases operation. You can remove DNS
    #   aliases from the file system after it is created using the
    #   DisassociateFileSystemAliases operation. You only need to specify
    #   the alias name in the request payload.
    #
    #   For more information, see [Working with DNS Aliases][1] and
    #   [Walkthrough 5: Using DNS aliases to access your file system][2],
    #   including additional steps you must take to be able to access your
    #   file system using a DNS alias.

    #
    #   * Formatted as a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN),
    #     `hostname.domain`, for example, `accounting.example.com`.
    #
    #   * Can contain alphanumeric characters, the underscore (\_), and the
    #     hyphen (-).
    #
    #   * Cannot start or end with a hyphen.
    #
    #   * Can start with a numeric.
    #
    #   For DNS alias names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic characters as
    #   lowercase letters (a-z), regardless of how you specify them: as
    #   uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or the corresponding letters
    #   in escape codes.

    #   GiB, to increase the storage capacity for the file system that
    #   you're updating.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> You can't make a storage capacity increase request if there is an
    #   existing storage capacity increase request in progress.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   For Lustre file systems, the storage capacity target value can be
    #   the following:
    #
    #   * For `SCRATCH_2`, `PERSISTENT_1`, and `PERSISTENT_2 SSD` deployment
    #     types, valid values are in multiples of 2400 GiB. The value must
    #     be greater than the current storage capacity.
    #
    #   * For `PERSISTENT HDD` file systems, valid values are multiples of
    #     6000 GiB for 12-MBps throughput per TiB file systems and multiples
    #     of 1800 GiB for 40-MBps throughput per TiB file systems. The
    #     values must be greater than the current storage capacity.
    #
    #   * For `SCRATCH_1` file systems, you can't increase the storage
    #     capacity.
    #
    #   For more information, see [Managing storage and throughput
    #   capacity][1] in the *FSx for Lustre User Guide*.
    #
    #   For FSx for OpenZFS file systems, the storage capacity target value
    #   must be at least 10 percent greater than the current storage
    #   capacity value. For more information, see [Managing storage
    #   capacity][2] in the *FSx for OpenZFS User Guide*.
    #
    #   For Windows file systems, the storage capacity target value must be
    #   at least 10 percent greater than the current storage capacity value.
    #   To increase storage capacity, the file system must have at least 16
    #   MBps of throughput capacity. For more information, see [Managing
    #   storage capacity][3] in the *Amazon FSxfor Windows File Server User
    #   Guide*.
    #
    #   For ONTAP file systems, the storage capacity target value must be at
    #   least 10 percent greater than the current storage capacity value.
