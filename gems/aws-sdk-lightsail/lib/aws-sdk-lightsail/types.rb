    #
    # @!attribute [rw] treat_missing_data
    #   Specifies how the alarm handles missing data points.
    #
    #   An alarm can treat missing data in the following ways:
    #
    #   * `breaching` - Assume the missing data is not within the threshold.
    #     Missing data counts towards the number of times the metric is not
    #     within the threshold.
    #
    #   * `notBreaching` - Assume the missing data is within the threshold.
    #     Missing data does not count towards the number of times the metric
    #     is not within the threshold.
    #
    #   * `ignore` - Ignore the missing data. Maintains the current alarm
    #     state.
    #
    #   * `missing` - Missing data is treated as missing.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] statistic
    #   The statistic for the metric associated with the alarm.
    #
    #   The following statistics are available:
    #
    #   * `Minimum` - The lowest value observed during the specified period.
    #     Use this value to determine low volumes of activity for your
    #     application.
    #
    #   * `Maximum` - The highest value observed during the specified
    #     period. Use this value to determine high volumes of activity for
    #     your application.
    #
    #   * `Sum` - All values submitted for the matching metric added
    #     together. You can use this statistic to determine the total volume
    #     of a metric.
    #
    #   * `Average` - The value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified
    #     period. By comparing this statistic with the Minimum and Maximum
    #     values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close
    #     the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values. This
    #     comparison helps you to know when to increase or decrease your
    #     resources.
    #
    #   * `SampleCount` - The count, or number, of data points used for the
    #     statistical calculation.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] metric_name
    #   The name of the metric associated with the alarm.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] state
    #   The current state of the alarm.
    #
    #   An alarm has the following possible states:
    #
    #   * `ALARM` - The metric is outside of the defined threshold.
    #
    #   * `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` - The alarm has just started, the metric is
    #     not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to
    #     determine the alarm state.
    #
    #   * `OK` - The metric is within the defined threshold.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] unit
    #   The unit of the metric associated with the alarm.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] contact_protocols
    #   The contact protocols for the alarm, such as `Email`, `SMS` (text

    # typically effective immediately except under the following conditions:
    #
    # * If an automatic snapshot has been created for the current day, and
    #   you change the snapshot time to a later time of day, then the new
    #   snapshot time will be effective the following day. This ensures that
    #   two snapshots are not created for the current day.
    #
    # * If an automatic snapshot has not yet been created for the current
    #   day, and you change the snapshot time to an earlier time of day,
    #   then the new snapshot time will be effective the following day and a
    #   snapshot is automatically created at the previously set time for the
    #   current day. This ensures that a snapshot is created for the current
    #   day.
    #
    # * If an automatic snapshot has not yet been created for the current
    #   day, and you change the snapshot time to a time that is within 30
    #   minutes from your current time, then the new snapshot time will be
    #   effective the following day and a snapshot is automatically created
    #   at the previously set time for the current day. This ensures that a
    #   snapshot is created for the current day, because 30 minutes is
    #   required between your current time and the new snapshot time that
    #   you specify.
    #
    # * If an automatic snapshot is scheduled to be created within 30
    #   minutes from your current time and you change the snapshot time,
    #   then the new snapshot time will be effective the following day and a
    #   snapshot is automatically created at the previously set time for the
    #   current day. This ensures that a snapshot is created for the current
    #   day, because 30 minutes is required between your current time and
    #   the new snapshot time that you specify.

    #
    #   The following failure reasons are possible:
    #
    #   * <b> <code>NO_AVAILABLE_CONTACTS</code> </b> - This failure applies
    #     to email validation, which is not available for Lightsail
    #     certificates.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>ADDITIONAL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED</code> </b> - Lightsail
    #     requires additional information to process this certificate
    #     request. This can happen as a fraud-protection measure, such as
    #     when the domain ranks within the Alexa top 1000 websites. To
    #     provide the required information, use the [AWS Support Center][1]
    #     to contact AWS Support.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> You cannot request a certificate for Amazon-owned domain names
    #     such as those ending in amazonaws.com, cloudfront.net, or
    #     elasticbeanstalk.com.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   * <b> <code>DOMAIN_NOT_ALLOWED</code> </b> - One or more of the
    #     domain names in the certificate request was reported as an unsafe
    #     domain by [VirusTotal][2]. To correct the problem, search for your
    #     domain name on the [VirusTotal][2] website. If your domain is
    #     reported as suspicious, see [Google Help for Hacked Websites][3]
    #     to learn what you can do.
    #
    #     If you believe that the result is a false positive, notify the
    #     organization that is reporting the domain. VirusTotal is an
    #     aggregate of several antivirus and URL scanners and cannot remove
    #     your domain from a block list itself. After you correct the
    #     problem and the VirusTotal registry has been updated, request a
    #     new certificate.
    #
    #     If you see this error and your domain is not included in the
    #     VirusTotal list, visit the [AWS Support Center][1] and create a
    #     case.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>INVALID_PUBLIC_DOMAIN</code> </b> - One or more of the
    #     domain names in the certificate request is not valid. Typically,
    #     this is because a domain name in the request is not a valid
    #     top-level domain. Try to request a certificate again, correcting
    #     any spelling errors or typos that were in the failed request, and
    #     ensure that all domain names in the request are for valid
    #     top-level domains. For example, you cannot request a certificate
    #     for `example.invalidpublicdomain` because `invalidpublicdomain` is
    #     not a valid top-level domain.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>OTHER</code> </b> - Typically, this failure occurs when
    #     there is a typographical error in one or more of the domain names
    #     in the certificate request. Try to request a certificate again,
    #     correcting any spelling errors or typos that were in the failed
    #     request.

    #   Valid distribution metric names are listed below, along with the
    #   most useful `statistics` to include in your request, and the
    #   published `unit` value.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>Requests</code> </b> - The total number of viewer
    #     requests received by your Lightsail distribution, for all HTTP
    #     methods, and for both HTTP and HTTPS requests.
    #
    #     `Statistics`\: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.
    #
    #     `Unit`\: The published unit is `None`.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>BytesDownloaded</code> </b> - The number of bytes
    #     downloaded by viewers for GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests.
    #
    #     `Statistics`\: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.
    #
    #     `Unit`\: The published unit is `None`.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>BytesUploaded </code> </b> - The number of bytes
    #     uploaded to your origin by your Lightsail distribution, using POST
    #     and PUT requests.
    #
    #     `Statistics`\: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.
    #
    #     `Unit`\: The published unit is `None`.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>TotalErrorRate</code> </b> - The percentage of all
    #     viewer requests for which the response's HTTP status code was 4xx
    #     or 5xx.
    #
    #     `Statistics`\: The most useful statistic is `Average`.
    #
    #     `Unit`\: The published unit is `Percent`.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>4xxErrorRate</code> </b> - The percentage of all viewer
    #     requests for which the response's HTTP status cod was 4xx. In
    #     these cases, the client or client viewer may have made an error.
    #     For example, a status code of 404 (Not Found) means that the
    #     client requested an object that could not be found.
    #
    #     `Statistics`\: The most useful statistic is `Average`.
    #
    #     `Unit`\: The published unit is `Percent`.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>5xxErrorRate</code> </b> - The percentage of all viewer
    #     requests for which the response's HTTP status code was 5xx. In
    #     these cases, the origin server did not satisfy the requests. For
    #     example, a status code of 503 (Service Unavailable) means that the
    #     origin server is currently unavailable.

    #     your application.
    #
    #   * `Sum` - All values submitted for the matching metric added
    #     together. You can use this statistic to determine the total volume
    #     of a metric.
    #
    #   * `Average` - The value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified
    #     period. By comparing this statistic with the Minimum and Maximum
    #     values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close
    #     the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values. This
    #     comparison helps you to know when to increase or decrease your
    #     resources.
    #
    #   * `SampleCount` - The count, or number, of data points used for the
    #     statistical calculation.

    #
    #   * <b> <code>BurstCapacityPercentage</code> </b> - The percentage of
    #     CPU performance available for your instance to burst above its
    #     baseline. Your instance continuously accrues and consumes burst
    #     capacity. Burst capacity stops accruing when your instance's

    #     instance continuously accrues and consumes burst capacity. Burst
    #     capacity time stops accruing when your instance's
    #     `BurstCapacityPercentage` metric reaches 100%.
    #
    #     Burst capacity time is consumed at the full rate only when your

    #     all network interfaces by the instance. This metric identifies the
    #     volume of incoming network traffic to the instance. The number
    #     reported is the number of bytes received during the period.

    #
    #   The following failure reasons are possible:

    #   * <b> <code>NO_AVAILABLE_CONTACTS</code> </b> - This failure applies
    #     to email validation, which is not available for Lightsail
    #     certificates.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>ADDITIONAL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED</code> </b> - Lightsail
    #     requires additional information to process this certificate
    #     request. This can happen as a fraud-protection measure, such as
    #     when the domain ranks within the Alexa top 1000 websites. To
    #     provide the required information, use the [AWS Support Center][1]
    #     to contact AWS Support.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> You cannot request a certificate for Amazon-owned domain names
    #     such as those ending in amazonaws.com, cloudfront.net, or
    #     elasticbeanstalk.com.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   * <b> <code>DOMAIN_NOT_ALLOWED</code> </b> - One or more of the
    #     domain names in the certificate request was reported as an unsafe
    #     domain by [VirusTotal][2]. To correct the problem, search for your
    #     domain name on the [VirusTotal][2] website. If your domain is
    #     reported as suspicious, see [Google Help for Hacked Websites][3]
    #     to learn what you can do.
    #
    #     If you believe that the result is a false positive, notify the
    #     organization that is reporting the domain. VirusTotal is an
    #     aggregate of several antivirus and URL scanners and cannot remove
    #     your domain from a block list itself. After you correct the
    #     problem and the VirusTotal registry has been updated, request a
    #     new certificate.
    #
    #     If you see this error and your domain is not included in the
    #     VirusTotal list, visit the [AWS Support Center][1] and create a
    #     case.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>INVALID_PUBLIC_DOMAIN</code> </b> - One or more of the
    #     domain names in the certificate request is not valid. Typically,
    #     this is because a domain name in the request is not a valid
    #     top-level domain. Try to request a certificate again, correcting
    #     any spelling errors or typos that were in the failed request, and
    #     ensure that all domain names in the request are for valid
    #     top-level domains. For example, you cannot request a certificate
    #     for `example.invalidpublicdomain` because `invalidpublicdomain` is
    #     not a valid top-level domain.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>OTHER</code> </b> - Typically, this failure occurs when
    #     there is a typographical error in one or more of the domain names
    #     in the certificate request. Try to request a certificate again,
    #     correcting any spelling errors or typos that were in the failed
    #     request.

    #     applications running on hosts communicating by an IP network. If
    #     you have an application that doesn't require reliable data stream
    #     service, use UDP instead.
    #
    #   * `all` - All transport layer protocol types. For more general
    #     information, see [Transport layer][1] on *Wikipedia*.
    #
    #   * `udp` - With User Datagram Protocol (UDP), computer applications
    #     can send messages (or datagrams) to other hosts on an Internet
    #     Protocol (IP) network. Prior communications are not required to
    #     set up transmission channels or data paths. Applications that
    #     don't require reliable data stream service can use UDP, which
    #     provides a connectionless datagram service that emphasizes reduced
    #     latency over reliability. If you do require reliable data stream
    #     service, use TCP instead.
    #
    #   * `icmp` - Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used to send
    #     error messages and operational information indicating success or
    #     failure when communicating with an instance. For example, an error
    #     is indicated when an instance could not be reached. When you
    #     specify `icmp` as the `protocol`, you must specify the ICMP type
    #     using the `fromPort` parameter, and ICMP code using the `toPort`
    #     parameter.

    # @!attribute [rw] monitored_resource_name
    #   The name of the Lightsail resource that will be monitored.

    #   Lightsail resources that can currently be monitored by alarms.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] comparison_operator
    #   The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] evaluation_periods
    #   The number of most recent periods over which data is compared to the
    #   specified threshold. If you are setting an "M out of N" alarm,
    #   this value (`evaluationPeriods`) is the N.
    #
    #   If you are setting an alarm that requires that a number of
    #   consecutive data points be breaching to trigger the alarm, this
    #   value specifies the rolling period of time in which data points are
    #   evaluated.
    #
    #   Each evaluation period is five minutes long. For example, specify an
    #   evaluation period of 24 to evaluate a metric over a rolling period
    #   of two hours.

    #   alarm, this value (`datapointsToAlarm`) is the M.
    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] treat_missing_data
    #   Sets how this alarm will handle missing data points.
    #
    #   An alarm can treat missing data in the following ways:
    #
    #   * `breaching` - Assume the missing data is not within the threshold.
    #     Missing data counts towards the number of times the metric is not
    #     within the threshold.
    #
    #   * `notBreaching` - Assume the missing data is within the threshold.
    #     Missing data does not count towards the number of times the metric
    #     is not within the threshold.
    #
    #   * `ignore` - Ignore the missing data. Maintains the current alarm
    #     state.
    #
    #   * `missing` - Missing data is treated as missing.
    #
    #   If `treatMissingData` is not specified, the default behavior of
    #   `missing` is used.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] contact_protocols
    #   The contact protocols to use for the alarm, such as `Email`, `SMS`
    #   (text messaging), or both.
    #
    #   A notification is sent via the specified contact protocol if
    #   notifications are enabled for the alarm, and when the alarm is
    #   triggered.
    #
    #   A notification is not sent if a contact protocol is not specified,
    #   if the specified contact protocol is not configured in the AWS
    #   Region, or if notifications are not enabled for the alarm using the
    #   `notificationEnabled` paramater.
    #
    #   Use the `CreateContactMethod` action to configure a contact protocol
    #   in an AWS Region.
    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] notification_triggers
    #   The alarm states that trigger a notification.
    #
    #   An alarm has the following possible states:
    #
    #   * `ALARM` - The metric is outside of the defined threshold.
    #
    #   * `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` - The alarm has just started, the metric is
    #     not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to
    #     determine the alarm state.
    #
    #   * `OK` - The metric is within the defined threshold.
    #
    #   When you specify a notification trigger, the `ALARM` state must be
    #   specified. The `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` and `OK` states can be specified
    #   in addition to the `ALARM` state.
    #
    #   * If you specify `OK` as an alarm trigger, a notification is sent
    #     when the alarm switches from an `ALARM` or `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`
    #     alarm state to an `OK` state. This can be thought of as an *all
    #     clear* alarm notification.
    #
    #   * If you specify `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` as the alarm trigger, a
    #     notification is sent when the alarm switches from an `OK` or
    #     `ALARM` alarm state to an `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state.
    #
    #   The notification trigger defaults to `ALARM` if you don't specify
    #   this parameter.
