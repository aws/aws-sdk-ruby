    #   @param [Hash] options
    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2 IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts are
    #       very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #       `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` to enable retries and extended
    #       timeouts.
    #
    #   @option options [required, String] :region
    #     The AWS region to connect to.  The configured `:region` is

    #     When `true`, an attempt is made to coerce request parameters into
    #     the required types.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :endpoint
    #     The client endpoint is normally constructed from the `:region`

    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_limit (3)
    #     The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #     ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #     are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #     checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors and auth
    #     errors from expired credentials.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_max_delay (0)

    # @!group API Operations

    # Retrieves an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) URL for the stream. You can
    # then open the URL in a browser or media player to view the stream
    # contents.
    #
    # You must specify either the `StreamName` or the `StreamARN`.
    #
    # An Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for
    # providing data through HLS:
    #
    # * The media type must be `video/h264`.
    #
    # * Data retention must be greater than 0.
    #
    # * The fragments must contain codec private data in the AVC (Advanced
    #   Video Coding) for H.264 format ([MPEG-4 specification ISO/IEC
    #   14496-15][1]). For information about adapting stream data to a given
    #   format, see [NAL Adaptation Flags][2].
    #
    # Kinesis Video Streams HLS sessions contain fragments in the fragmented
    # MPEG-4 form (also called fMP4 or CMAF), rather than the MPEG-2 form
    # (also called TS chunks, which the HLS specification also supports).
    # For more information about HLS fragment types, see the [HLS
    # specification][3].
    #
    # The following procedure shows how to use HLS with Kinesis Video
    # Streams:
    #
    # 1.  Get an endpoint using [GetDataEndpoint][4], specifying
    #     `GET_HLS_STREAMING_SESSION_URL` for the `APIName` parameter.
    #
    # 2.  Retrieve the HLS URL using `GetHLSStreamingSessionURL`. Kinesis
    #     Video Streams creates an HLS streaming session to be used for
    #     accessing content in a stream using the HLS protocol.
    #     `GetHLSStreamingSessionURL` returns an authenticated URL (that
    #     includes an encrypted session token) for the session's HLS
    #     *master playlist* (the root resource needed for streaming with
    #     HLS).
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Don't share or store this token where an unauthorized entity
    #     could access it. The token provides access to the content of the
    #     stream. Safeguard the token with the same measures that you would
    #     use with your AWS credentials.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #     The media that is made available through the playlist consists
    #     only of the requested stream, time range, and format. No other
    #     media data (such as frames outside the requested window or
    #     alternate bit rates) is made available.
    #
    # 3.  Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for the
    #     HLS master playlist to a media player that supports the HLS
    #     protocol. Kinesis Video Streams makes the HLS media playlist,
    #     initialization fragment, and media fragments available through the
    #     master playlist URL. The initialization fragment contains the
    #     codec private data for the stream, and other data needed to set up
    #     the video decoder and renderer. The media fragments contain
    #     H.264-encoded video frames and time stamps.
    #
    # 4.  The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests
    #     stream metadata and media data normally. When the media player
    #     requests data, it calls the following actions:
    #
    #     * **GetHLSMasterPlaylist:** Retrieves an HLS master playlist,
    #       which contains a URL for the `GetHLSMediaPlaylist` action, and
    #       additional metadata for the media player, including estimated
    #       bit rate and resolution.
    #
    #     * **GetHLSMediaPlaylist:** Retrieves an HLS media playlist, which
    #       contains a URL to access the MP4 initialization fragment with
    #       the `GetMP4InitFragment` action, and URLs to access the MP4
    #       media fragments with the `GetMP4MediaFragment` actions. The HLS
    #       media playlist also contains metadata about the stream that the
    #       player needs to play it, such as whether the `PlaybackMode` is
    #       `LIVE` or `ON_DEMAND`. The HLS media playlist is typically
    #       static for sessions with a `PlaybackType` of `ON_DEMAND`. The
    #       HLS media playlist is continually updated with new fragments for
    #       sessions with a `PlaybackType` of `LIVE`.
    #
    #     * **GetMP4InitFragment:** Retrieves the MP4 initialization
    #       fragment. The media player typically loads the initialization
    #       fragment before loading any media fragments. This fragment
    #       contains the "`fytp`" and "`moov`" MP4 atoms, and the child
    #       atoms that are needed to initialize the media player decoder.
    #
    #       The initialization fragment does not correspond to a fragment in
    #       a Kinesis video stream. It contains only the codec private data
    #       for the stream, which the media player needs to decode video
    #       frames.
    #
    #     * **GetMP4MediaFragment:** Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These
    #       fragments contain the "`moof`" and "`mdat`" MP4 atoms and
    #       their child atoms, containing the encoded fragment's video
    #       frames and their time stamps.
    #
    #       <note markdown="1"> After the first media fragment is made available in a streaming
    #       session, any fragments that don't contain the same codec
    #       private data are excluded in the HLS media playlist. Therefore,
    #       the codec private data does not change between fragments in a
    #       session.
    #
    #        </note>
    #
    #       Data retrieved with this action is billable. See
    #       [Pricing](aws.amazon.comkinesis/video-streams/pricing/) for
    #       details.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> The following restrictions apply to HLS sessions:
    #
    #  * A streaming session URL should not be shared between players. The
    #   service might throttle a session if multiple media players are
    #   sharing it. For connection limits, see [Kinesis Video Streams
    #   Limits][5].
    #
    # * A Kinesis video stream can have a maximum of five active HLS
    #   streaming sessions. If a new session is created when the maximum
    #   number of sessions is already active, the oldest (earliest created)
    #   session is closed. The number of active `GetMedia` connections on a
    #   Kinesis video stream does not count against this limit, and the
    #   number of active HLS sessions does not count against the active
    #   `GetMedia` connection limit.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # You can monitor the amount of data that the media player consumes by
    # monitoring the `GetMP4MediaFragment.OutgoingBytes` Amazon CloudWatch
    # metric. For information about using CloudWatch to monitor Kinesis
    # Video Streams, see [Monitoring Kinesis Video Streams][6]. For pricing
    # information, see [Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Pricing][7] and [AWS
    # Pricing][8]. Charges for both HLS sessions and outgoing AWS data
    # apply.
    #
    # For more information about HLS, see [HTTP Live Streaming][9] on the
    # [Apple Developer site][10].

    # @option params [String] :stream_name
    #   The name of the stream for which to retrieve the HLS master playlist
    #   URL.
    #
    #   You must specify either the `StreamName` or the `StreamARN`.
    #
    # @option params [String] :stream_arn
    #   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream for which to retrieve the
    #   HLS master playlist URL.
    #
    #   You must specify either the `StreamName` or the `StreamARN`.
    #
    # @option params [String] :playback_mode
    #   Whether to retrieve live or archived, on-demand data.
    #
    #   Features of the two types of session include the following:
    #
    #   * <b> <code>LIVE</code> </b>\: For sessions of this type, the HLS
    #     media playlist is continually updated with the latest fragments as
    #     they become available. We recommend that the media player retrieve a
    #     new playlist on a one-second interval. When this type of session is
    #     played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
    #     "live" notification, with no scrubber control for choosing the
    #     position in the playback window to display.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> In `LIVE` mode, the newest available fragments are included in an
    #     HLS media playlist, even if there is a gap between fragments (that
    #     is, if a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause a media
    #     player to halt or cause a jump in playback. In this mode, fragments
    #     are not added to the HLS media playlist if they are older than the
    #     newest fragment in the playlist. If the missing fragment becomes
    #     available after a subsequent fragment is added to the playlist, the
    #     older fragment is not added, and the gap is not filled.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   * <b> <code>ON_DEMAND</code> </b>\: For sessions of this type, the HLS
    #     media playlist contains all the fragments for the session, up to the
    #     number that is specified in `MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults`. The
    #     playlist must be retrieved only once for each session. When this
    #     type of session is played in a media player, the user interface
    #     typically displays a scrubber control for choosing the position in
    #     the playback window to display.
    #
    #   In both playback modes, if `FragmentSelectorType` is
    #   `PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP`, and if there are multiple fragments with the
    #   same start time stamp, the fragment that has the larger fragment
    #   number (that is, the newer fragment) is included in the HLS media
    #   playlist. The other fragments are not included. Fragments that have
    #   different time stamps but have overlapping durations are still
    #   included in the HLS media playlist. This can lead to unexpected
    #   behavior in the media player.
    #
    #   The default is `LIVE`.
    #
    # @option params [Types::HLSFragmentSelector] :hls_fragment_selector
    #   The time range of the requested fragment, and the source of the time
    #   stamps.
    #
    #   This parameter is required if `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND`. This
    #   parameter is optional if `PlaybackMode` is `LIVE`. If `PlaybackMode`
    #   is `LIVE`, the `FragmentSelectorType` can be set, but the
    #   `TimestampRange` should not be set. If `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND`,
    #   both `FragmentSelectorType` and `TimestampRange` must be set.
    #
    # @option params [String] :discontinuity_mode
    #   Specifies when flags marking discontinuities between fragments will be
    #   added to the media playlists. The default is `ALWAYS` when
    #   HLSFragmentSelector is `SERVER_TIMESTAMP`, and `NEVER` when it is
    #   `PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP`.
    #
    #   Media players typically build a timeline of media content to play,
    #   based on the time stamps of each fragment. This means that if there is
    #   any overlap between fragments (as is typical if HLSFragmentSelector is
    #   `SERVER_TIMESTAMP`), the media player timeline has small gaps between
    #   fragments in some places, and overwrites frames in other places. When
    #   there are discontinuity flags between fragments, the media player is
    #   expected to reset the timeline, resulting in the fragment being played
    #   immediately after the previous fragment. We recommend that you always
    #   have discontinuity flags between fragments if the fragment time stamps
    #   are not accurate or if fragments might be missing. You should not
    #   place discontinuity flags between fragments for the player timeline to
    #   accurately map to the producer time stamps.
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :expires
    #   The time in seconds until the requested session expires. This value
    #   can be between 300 (5 minutes) and 43200 (12 hours).
    #
    #   When a session expires, no new calls to `GetHLSMasterPlaylist`,
    #   `GetHLSMediaPlaylist`, `GetMP4InitFragment`, or `GetMP4MediaFragment`
    #   can be made for that session.
    #
    #   The default is 300 (5 minutes).
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :max_media_playlist_fragment_results
    #   The maximum number of fragments that are returned in the HLS media
    #   playlists.
    #
    #   When the `PlaybackMode` is `LIVE`, the most recent fragments are
    #   returned up to this value. When the `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND`, the
    #   oldest fragments are returned, up to this maximum number.
    #
    #   When there are a higher number of fragments available in a live HLS
    #   media playlist, video players often buffer content before starting
    #   playback. Increasing the buffer size increases the playback latency,
    #   but it decreases the likelihood that rebuffering will occur during
    #   playback. We recommend that a live HLS media playlist have a minimum
    #   of 3 fragments and a maximum of 10 fragments.
    #
    #   The default is 5 fragments if `PlaybackMode` is `LIVE`, and 1,000 if
    #   `PlaybackMode` is `ON_DEMAND`.
    #
    #   The maximum value of 1,000 fragments corresponds to more than 16
    #   minutes of video on streams with 1-second fragments, and more than 2
    #   1/2 hours of video on streams with 10-second fragments.
