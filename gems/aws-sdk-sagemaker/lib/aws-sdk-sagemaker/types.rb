    #
    #    </note>
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] training_input_mode
    #   The training input mode that the algorithm supports. For more
    #   information about input modes, see [Algorithms][1].
    #
    #   **Pipe mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `Pipe` mode, Amazon SageMaker streams data
    #   directly from Amazon S3 to the container.
    #
    #   **File mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `File` mode, SageMaker downloads the
    #   training data from S3 to the provisioned ML storage volume, and
    #   mounts the directory to the Docker volume for the training
    #   container.
    #
    #   You must provision the ML storage volume with sufficient capacity to
    #   accommodate the data downloaded from S3. In addition to the training
    #   data, the ML storage volume also stores the output model. The
    #   algorithm container uses the ML storage volume to also store
    #   intermediate information, if any.
    #
    #   For distributed algorithms, training data is distributed uniformly.
    #   Your training duration is predictable if the input data objects
    #   sizes are approximately the same. SageMaker does not split the files
    #   any further for model training. If the object sizes are skewed,
    #   training won't be optimal as the data distribution is also skewed
    #   when one host in a training cluster is overloaded, thus becoming a
    #   bottleneck in training.
    #
    #   **FastFile mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `FastFile` mode, SageMaker streams data
    #   directly from S3 to the container with no code changes, and provides
    #   file system access to the data. Users can author their training
    #   script to interact with these files as if they were stored on disk.
    #
    #   `FastFile` mode works best when the data is read sequentially.
    #   Augmented manifest files aren't supported. The startup time is
    #   lower when there are fewer files in the S3 bucket provided.

    #   chooses `ENSEMBLING` for datasets smaller than 100 MB, and
    #   `HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING` for larger ones.
    #
    #   The `ENSEMBLING` mode uses a multi-stack ensemble model to predict
    #   classification and regression tasks directly from your dataset. This
    #   machine learning mode combines several base models to produce an
    #   optimal predictive model. It then uses a stacking ensemble method to
    #   combine predictions from contributing members. A multi-stack
    #   ensemble model can provide better performance over a single model by
    #   combining the predictive capabilities of multiple models. See
    #   [Autopilot algorithm support][1] for a list of algorithms supported
    #   by `ENSEMBLING` mode.
    #
    #   The `HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING` (HPO) mode uses the best hyperparameters
    #   to train the best version of a model. HPO automatically selects an
    #   algorithm for the type of problem you want to solve. Then HPO finds
    #   the best hyperparameters according to your objective metric. See

    #   The data type.
    #
    #   * If you choose `S3Prefix`, `S3Uri` identifies a key name prefix.
    #     SageMaker uses all objects that match the specified key name
    #     prefix for model training.
    #
    #     The `S3Prefix` should have the following format:
    #
    #     `s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER-OR-FILE`
    #
    #   * If you choose `ManifestFile`, `S3Uri` identifies an object that is
    #     a manifest file containing a list of object keys that you want
    #     SageMaker to use for model training.
    #
    #     A `ManifestFile` should have the format shown below:
    #
    #     `[ \{"prefix":
    #     "s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER/DOC-EXAMPLE-PREFIX/"\},
    #     `

    #
    #     `... "DOC-EXAMPLE-RELATIVE-PATH/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER/DATA-N" ]`
    #
    #   * If you choose `AugmentedManifestFile`, `S3Uri` identifies an
    #     object that is an augmented manifest file in JSON lines format.
    #     This file contains the data you want to use for model training.
    #     `AugmentedManifestFile` is available for V2 API jobs only (for
    #     example, for jobs created by calling `CreateAutoMLJobV2`).
    #
    #     Here is a minimal, single-record example of an
    #     `AugmentedManifestFile`:
    #
    #     `\{"source-ref":

    #   A configuration for a shuffle option for input data in a channel. If

    #   the S3 key prefix matches. If you use `ManifestFile`, the order of
    #   the S3 object references in the `ManifestFile` is shuffled. If you
    #   use `AugmentedManifestFile`, the order of the JSON lines in the
    #   `AugmentedManifestFile` is shuffled. The shuffling order is
    #   determined using the `Seed` value.
    #
    #   For Pipe input mode, shuffling is done at the start of every epoch.
    #   With large datasets this ensures that the order of the training data
    #   is different for each epoch, it helps reduce bias and possible

    #
    #   You must specify at least one of the following: `S3DataSource` or
    #   `SnsDataSource`.
    #
    #   * Use `SnsDataSource` to specify an SNS input topic for a streaming
    #     labeling job. If you do not specify and SNS input topic ARN,

    #     all data objects in the input manifest file have been labeled.
    #
    #   * Use `S3DataSource` to specify an input manifest file for both
    #     streaming and one-time labeling jobs. Adding an `S3DataSource` is
    #     optional if you use `SnsDataSource` to create a streaming labeling
    #     job.
    #
    #   If you use the Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce, your input data
    #   should not include confidential information, personal information or

    #   successfully complete data labeling.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] label_category_config_s3_uri
    #   The S3 URI of the file, referred to as a *label category
    #   configuration file*, that defines the categories used to label the
    #   data objects.
    #
    #   For 3D point cloud and video frame task types, you can add label
    #   category attributes and frame attributes to your label category
    #   configuration file. To learn how, see [Create a Labeling Category
    #   Configuration File for 3D Point Cloud Labeling Jobs][1].
    #
    #   For named entity recognition jobs, in addition to `"labels"`, you
    #   must provide worker instructions in the label category configuration
    #   file using the `"instructions"` parameter: `"instructions":
    #   \{"shortInstruction":"<h1>Add header</h1><p>Add Instructions</p>",
    #   "fullInstruction":"<p>Add additional instructions.</p>"\}`. For
    #   details and an example, see [Create a Named Entity Recognition
    #   Labeling Job (API) ][2].
    #
    #   For all other [built-in task types][3] and [custom tasks][4], your
    #   label category configuration file must be a JSON file in the
    #   following format. Identify the labels you want to use by replacing
    #   `label_1`, `label_2`,`...`,`label_n` with your label categories.
    #
    #   `\{ `
    #
    #   `"document-version": "2018-11-28",`
    #
    #   `"labels": [\{"label": "label_1"\},\{"label":
    #   "label_2"\},...\{"label": "label_n"\}]`
    #
    #   `\}`
    #
    #   Note the following about the label category configuration file:
    #
    #   * For image classification and text classification (single and
    #     multi-label) you must specify at least two label categories. For
    #     all other task types, the minimum number of label categories
    #     required is one.
    #
    #   * Each label category must be unique, you cannot specify duplicate
    #     label categories.
    #
    #   * If you create a 3D point cloud or video frame adjustment or
    #     verification labeling job, you must include
    #     `auditLabelAttributeName` in the label category configuration. Use
    #     this parameter to enter the [ `LabelAttributeName` ][5] of the
    #     labeling job you want to adjust or verify annotations of.

    #   channel provides the S3, EFS, or FSx location where the input data
    #   is stored. It also provides information about the stored data: the
    #   MIME type, compression method, and whether the data is wrapped in
    #   RecordIO format.
    #
    #   Depending on the input mode that the algorithm supports, SageMaker
    #   either copies input data files from an S3 bucket to a local
    #   directory in the Docker container, or makes it available as input
    #   streams. For example, if you specify an EFS location, input data
    #   files are available as input streams. They do not need to be
    #   downloaded.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] enable_inter_container_traffic_encryption
    #   To encrypt all communications between ML compute instances in

    #
    #   Multiply `BillableTimeInSeconds` by the number of instances
    #   (`InstanceCount`) in your training cluster to get the total compute
    #   time SageMaker bills you if you run distributed training. The
    #   formula is as follows: `BillableTimeInSeconds * InstanceCount` .
    #
    #   You can calculate the savings from using managed spot training using
    #   the formula `(1 - BillableTimeInSeconds / TrainingTimeInSeconds) *
    #   100`. For example, if `BillableTimeInSeconds` is 100 and

    #
    # Metrics
    #
    # : To define a metric filter, enter a value using the form
    #   `"Metrics.<name>"`, where `<name>` is a metric name. For example,
    #   the following filter searches for training jobs with an `"accuracy"`
    #   metric greater than `"0.9"`:
    #
    #   `\{`
    #
    #   `"Name": "Metrics.accuracy",`
    #
    #   `"Operator": "GreaterThan",`
    #
    #   `"Value": "0.9"`
    #
    #   `\}`
    #
    # HyperParameters
    #
    # : To define a hyperparameter filter, enter a value with the form
    #   `"HyperParameters.<name>"`. Decimal hyperparameter values are
    #   treated as a decimal in a comparison if the specified `Value` is
    #   also a decimal value. If the specified `Value` is an integer, the
    #   decimal hyperparameter values are treated as integers. For example,
    #   the following filter is satisfied by training jobs with a
    #   `"learning_rate"` hyperparameter that is less than `"0.5"`:
    #
    #   ` \{`
    #
    #   ` "Name": "HyperParameters.learning_rate",`
    #
    #   ` "Operator": "LessThan",`
    #
    #   ` "Value": "0.5"`

    #   : The `Name` property exists.
    #
    #   NotExists
    #
    #   : The `Name` property does not exist.
    #
    #   GreaterThan
    #
    #   : The value of `Name` is greater than `Value`. Not supported for
    #     text properties.
    #
    #   GreaterThanOrEqualTo
    #
    #   : The value of `Name` is greater than or equal to `Value`. Not

    #
    #   Contains
    #
    #   : The value of `Name` contains the string `Value`. Only supported
    #     for text properties.

    # @!attribute [rw] training_input_mode
    #   The training input mode that the algorithm supports. For more
    #   information about input modes, see [Algorithms][1].
    #
    #   **Pipe mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `Pipe` mode, Amazon SageMaker streams data
    #   directly from Amazon S3 to the container.
    #
    #   **File mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `File` mode, SageMaker downloads the
    #   training data from S3 to the provisioned ML storage volume, and
    #   mounts the directory to the Docker volume for the training
    #   container.
    #
    #   You must provision the ML storage volume with sufficient capacity to
    #   accommodate the data downloaded from S3. In addition to the training
    #   data, the ML storage volume also stores the output model. The
    #   algorithm container uses the ML storage volume to also store
    #   intermediate information, if any.
    #
    #   For distributed algorithms, training data is distributed uniformly.
    #   Your training duration is predictable if the input data objects
    #   sizes are approximately the same. SageMaker does not split the files
    #   any further for model training. If the object sizes are skewed,
    #   training won't be optimal as the data distribution is also skewed
    #   when one host in a training cluster is overloaded, thus becoming a
    #   bottleneck in training.
    #
    #   **FastFile mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `FastFile` mode, SageMaker streams data
    #   directly from S3 to the container with no code changes, and provides
    #   file system access to the data. Users can author their training
    #   script to interact with these files as if they were stored on disk.
    #
    #   `FastFile` mode works best when the data is read sequentially.
    #   Augmented manifest files aren't supported. The startup time is
    #   lower when there are fewer files in the S3 bucket provided.

    #
    #   * `KERAS`: You must specify the name and shape (NCHW format) of

    #     model. Note that while Keras model artifacts should be uploaded in
    #     NHWC (channel-last) format, `DataInputConfig` should be specified

    #
    #   `DataInputConfig` supports the following parameters for `CoreML`
    #   `TargetDevice` (ML Model format):
    #
    #   * `shape`: Input shape, for example `\{"input_1": \{"shape":
    #     [1,224,224,3]\}\}`. In addition to static input shapes, CoreML
    #     converter supports Flexible input shapes:
    #
    #     * Range Dimension. You can use the Range Dimension feature if you
    #       know the input shape will be within some specific interval in
    #       that dimension, for example: `\{"input_1": \{"shape": ["1..10",
    #       224, 224, 3]\}\}`
    #
    #     * Enumerated shapes. Sometimes, the models are trained to work
    #       only on a select set of inputs. You can enumerate all supported
    #       input shapes, for example: `\{"input_1": \{"shape": [[1, 224,
    #       224, 3], [1, 160, 160, 3]]\}\}`
    #
    #   * `default_shape`: Default input shape. You can set a default shape
    #     during conversion for both Range Dimension and Enumerated Shapes.
    #     For example `\{"input_1": \{"shape": ["1..10", 224, 224, 3],
    #     "default_shape": [1, 224, 224, 3]\}\}`
    #
    #   * `type`: Input type. Allowed values: `Image` and `Tensor`. By
    #     default, the converter generates an ML Model with inputs of type
    #     Tensor (MultiArray). User can set input type to be Image. Image
    #     input type requires additional input parameters such as `bias` and
    #     `scale`.
    #
    #   * `bias`: If the input type is an Image, you need to provide the
    #     bias vector.
    #
    #   * `scale`: If the input type is an Image, you need to provide a
    #     scale factor.
    #
    #   CoreML `ClassifierConfig` parameters can be specified using
    #   [OutputConfig][1] `CompilerOptions`. CoreML converter supports
    #   Tensorflow and PyTorch models. CoreML conversion examples:
    #
    #   * Tensor type input:
    #
    #     * `"DataInputConfig": \{"input_1": \{"shape": [[1,224,224,3],
    #       [1,160,160,3]], "default_shape": [1,224,224,3]\}\}`
    #
    #     ^
    #
    #   * Tensor type input without input name (PyTorch):
    #
    #     * `"DataInputConfig": [\{"shape": [[1,3,224,224], [1,3,160,160]],
    #       "default_shape": [1,3,224,224]\}]`
    #
    #     ^
    #
    #   * Image type input:
    #
    #     * `"DataInputConfig": \{"input_1": \{"shape": [[1,224,224,3],
    #       [1,160,160,3]], "default_shape": [1,224,224,3], "type": "Image",
    #       "bias": [-1,-1,-1], "scale": 0.007843137255\}\}`
    #
    #     * `"CompilerOptions": \{"class_labels":
    #       "imagenet_labels_1000.txt"\}`
    #
    #   * Image type input without input name (PyTorch):
    #
    #     * `"DataInputConfig": [\{"shape": [[1,3,224,224], [1,3,160,160]],
    #       "default_shape": [1,3,224,224], "type": "Image", "bias":
    #       [-1,-1,-1], "scale": 0.007843137255\}]`
    #
    #     * `"CompilerOptions": \{"class_labels":
    #       "imagenet_labels_1000.txt"\}`
    #
    #   Depending on the model format, `DataInputConfig` requires the
    #   following parameters for `ml_eia2` [OutputConfig:TargetDevice][2].
    #
    #   * For TensorFlow models saved in the SavedModel format, specify the
    #     input names from `signature_def_key` and the input model shapes
    #     for `DataInputConfig`. Specify the `signature_def_key` in [
    #     `OutputConfig:CompilerOptions` ][3] if the model does not use
    #     TensorFlow's default signature def key. For example:
    #
    #     * `"DataInputConfig": \{"inputs": [1, 224, 224, 3]\}`
    #
    #     * `"CompilerOptions": \{"signature_def_key": "serving_custom"\}`
    #
    #   * For TensorFlow models saved as a frozen graph, specify the input
    #     tensor names and shapes in `DataInputConfig` and the output tensor
    #     names for `output_names` in [ `OutputConfig:CompilerOptions` ][3].
    #     For example:
    #
    #     * `"DataInputConfig": \{"input_tensor:0": [1, 224, 224, 3]\}`
    #
    #     * `"CompilerOptions": \{"output_names": ["output_tensor:0"]\}`

    #   <note markdown="1"> SageMaker Training on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) P4de
    #   instances is in preview release starting December 9th, 2022.
    #
    #    [Amazon EC2 P4de instances][1] (currently in preview) are powered by
    #   8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 80GB high-performance HBM2e GPU memory,
    #   which accelerate the speed of training ML models that need to be
    #   trained on large datasets of high-resolution data. In this preview
    #   release, Amazon SageMaker supports ML training jobs on P4de
    #   instances (`ml.p4de.24xlarge`) to reduce model training time. The
    #   `ml.p4de.24xlarge` instances are available in the following Amazon
    #   Web Services Regions.
    #
    #    * US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)
    #
    #   * US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)
    #
    #    To request quota limit increase and start using P4de instances,
    #   contact the SageMaker Training service team through your account
    #   team.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] volume_size_in_gb
    #   The size of the ML storage volume that you want to provision.
    #
    #   ML storage volumes store model artifacts and incremental states.
    #   Training algorithms might also use the ML storage volume for scratch
    #   space. If you want to store the training data in the ML storage
    #   volume, choose `File` as the `TrainingInputMode` in the algorithm
    #   specification.
    #
    #   When using an ML instance with [NVMe SSD volumes][1], SageMaker
    #   doesn't provision Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2) storage.
    #   Available storage is fixed to the NVMe-type instance's storage
    #   capacity. SageMaker configures storage paths for training datasets,
    #   checkpoints, model artifacts, and outputs to use the entire capacity
    #   of the instance storage. For example, ML instance families with the
    #   NVMe-type instance storage include `ml.p4d`, `ml.g4dn`, and `ml.g5`.
    #
    #   When using an ML instance with the EBS-only storage option and
    #   without instance storage, you must define the size of EBS volume
    #   through `VolumeSizeInGB` in the `ResourceConfig` API. For example,
    #   ML instance families that use EBS volumes include `ml.c5` and
    #   `ml.p2`.

    #   volumes, see [Amazon EC2 Instance Types][2].

    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Certain Nitro-based instances include local storage, dependent on
    #   the instance type. Local storage volumes are encrypted using a
    #   hardware module on the instance. You can't request a

    #   * A key name prefix might look like this:
    #     `s3://bucketname/exampleprefix`
    #
    #   * A manifest might look like this:
    #     `s3://bucketname/example.manifest`
    #
    #     A manifest is an S3 object which is a JSON file consisting of an
    #     array of elements. The first element is a prefix which is followed
    #     by one or more suffixes. SageMaker appends the suffix elements to
    #     the prefix to get a full set of `S3Uri`. Note that the prefix must
    #     be a valid non-empty `S3Uri` that precludes users from specifying
    #     a manifest whose individual `S3Uri` is sourced from different S3
    #     buckets.
    #
    #     The following code example shows a valid manifest format:
    #
    #     `[ \{"prefix": "s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/"\},`
    #
    #     ` "relative/path/to/custdata-1",`

    #
    #     ` ...`
    #
    #     ` "relative/path/custdata-N"`
    #
    #     `]`
    #
    #     This JSON is equivalent to the following `S3Uri` list:
    #
    #     `s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/to/custdata-1`
    #
    #     `s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/custdata-2`

    #
    #     `s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/custdata-N`
    #
    #     The complete set of `S3Uri` in this manifest is the input data for
    #     the channel for this data source. The object that each `S3Uri`
    #     points to must be readable by the IAM role that SageMaker uses to
    #     perform tasks on your behalf.

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] compression_type
    #   Specifies how the ML model data is prepared.
    #
    #   If you choose `Gzip` and choose `S3Object` as the value of
    #   `S3DataType`, `S3Uri` identifies an object that is a gzip-compressed
    #   TAR archive. SageMaker will attempt to decompress and untar the
    #   object during model deployment.
    #
    #   If you choose `None` and chooose `S3Object` as the value of
    #   `S3DataType`, `S3Uri` identifies an object that represents an
    #   uncompressed ML model to deploy.
    #
    #   If you choose None and choose `S3Prefix` as the value of
    #   `S3DataType`, `S3Uri` identifies a key name prefix, under which all
    #   objects represents the uncompressed ML model to deploy.
    #
    #   If you choose None, then SageMaker will follow rules below when
    #   creating model data files under /opt/ml/model directory for use by
    #   your inference code:
    #
    #   * If you choose `S3Object` as the value of `S3DataType`, then
    #     SageMaker will split the key of the S3 object referenced by
    #     `S3Uri` by slash (/), and use the last part as the filename of the
    #     file holding the content of the S3 object.
    #
    #   * If you choose `S3Prefix` as the value of `S3DataType`, then for
    #     each S3 object under the key name pefix referenced by `S3Uri`,
    #     SageMaker will trim its key by the prefix, and use the remainder
    #     as the path (relative to `/opt/ml/model`) of the file holding the
    #     content of the S3 object. SageMaker will split the remainder by
    #     slash (/), using intermediate parts as directory names and the
    #     last part as filename of the file holding the content of the S3
    #     object.
    #
    #   * Do not use any of the following as file names or directory names:
    #
    #     * An empty or blank string
    #
    #     * A string which contains null bytes
    #
    #     * A string longer than 255 bytes
    #
    #     * A single dot (`.`)
    #
    #     * A double dot (`..`)
    #
    #   * Ambiguous file names will result in model deployment failure. For
    #     example, if your uncompressed ML model consists of two S3 objects
    #     `s3://mybucket/model/weights` and
    #     `s3://mybucket/model/weights/part1` and you specify
    #     `s3://mybucket/model/` as the value of `S3Uri` and `S3Prefix` as
    #     the value of `S3DataType`, then it will result in name clash
    #     between `/opt/ml/model/weights` (a regular file) and
    #     `/opt/ml/model/weights/` (a directory).
    #
    #   * Do not organize the model artifacts in [S3 console using
    #     folders][1]. When you create a folder in S3 console, S3 creates a
    #     0-byte object with a key set to the folder name you provide. They
    #     key of the 0-byte object ends with a slash (/) which violates
    #     SageMaker restrictions on model artifact file names, leading to
    #     model deployment failure.

    #     following:
    #
    #     `Hourly: cron(0 * ? * * *)`
    #
    #   * If you want to start the job daily:
    #
    #     `cron(0 [00-23] ? * * *)`
    #
    #   For example, the following are valid cron expressions:
    #
    #   * Daily at noon UTC: `cron(0 12 ? * * *)`
    #
    #   * Daily at midnight UTC: `cron(0 0 ? * * *)`
    #
    #   To support running every 6, 12 hours, the following are also
    #   supported:
    #
    #   `cron(0 [00-23]/[01-24] ? * * *)`
    #
    #   For example, the following are valid cron expressions:
    #
    #   * Every 12 hours, starting at 5pm UTC: `cron(0 17/12 ? * * *)`
    #
    #   * Every two hours starting at midnight: `cron(0 0/2 ? * * *)`
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> * Even though the cron expression is set to start at 5PM UTC, note
    #     that there could be a delay of 0-20 minutes from the actual
    #     requested time to run the execution.
    #
    #   * We recommend that if you would like a daily schedule, you do not
    #     provide this parameter. Amazon SageMaker will pick a time for

    #
    #     * Launched instance was unhealthy, replacing it!
    #
    #     * Preparing the instances for training.
    #
    #   Training
    #   : * Downloading the training image.
    #
    #     * Training image download completed. Training in progress.
    #
    #   Status messages are subject to change. Therefore, we recommend not
    #   including them in code that programmatically initiates actions. For
    #   examples, don't use status messages in if statements.
    #
    #   To have an overview of your training job's progress, view
    #   `TrainingJobStatus` and `SecondaryStatus` in
    #   [DescribeTrainingJob][1], and `StatusMessage` together. For example,
    #   at the start of a training job, you might see the following:

    #
    #   * `SecondaryStatus` - Training

    # To stop a training job, SageMaker sends the algorithm the `SIGTERM`

    #   chooses `ENSEMBLING` for datasets smaller than 100 MB, and
    #   `HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING` for larger ones.
    #
    #   The `ENSEMBLING` mode uses a multi-stack ensemble model to predict
    #   classification and regression tasks directly from your dataset. This
    #   machine learning mode combines several base models to produce an
    #   optimal predictive model. It then uses a stacking ensemble method to
    #   combine predictions from contributing members. A multi-stack
    #   ensemble model can provide better performance over a single model by
    #   combining the predictive capabilities of multiple models. See
    #   [Autopilot algorithm support][1] for a list of algorithms supported
    #   by `ENSEMBLING` mode.
    #
    #   The `HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING` (HPO) mode uses the best hyperparameters
    #   to train the best version of a model. HPO automatically selects an

    # Defines the input needed to run a training job using the algorithm.
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] training_input_mode
    #   The training input mode that the algorithm supports. For more
    #   information about input modes, see [Algorithms][1].
    #
    #   **Pipe mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `Pipe` mode, Amazon SageMaker streams data
    #   directly from Amazon S3 to the container.
    #
    #   **File mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `File` mode, SageMaker downloads the
    #   training data from S3 to the provisioned ML storage volume, and
    #   mounts the directory to the Docker volume for the training
    #   container.
    #
    #   You must provision the ML storage volume with sufficient capacity to
    #   accommodate the data downloaded from S3. In addition to the training
    #   data, the ML storage volume also stores the output model. The
    #   algorithm container uses the ML storage volume to also store
    #   intermediate information, if any.
    #
    #   For distributed algorithms, training data is distributed uniformly.
    #   Your training duration is predictable if the input data objects
    #   sizes are approximately the same. SageMaker does not split the files
    #   any further for model training. If the object sizes are skewed,
    #   training won't be optimal as the data distribution is also skewed
    #   when one host in a training cluster is overloaded, thus becoming a
    #   bottleneck in training.
    #
    #   **FastFile mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `FastFile` mode, SageMaker streams data
    #   directly from S3 to the container with no code changes, and provides
    #   file system access to the data. Users can author their training
    #   script to interact with these files as if they were stored on disk.
    #
    #   `FastFile` mode works best when the data is read sequentially.
    #   Augmented manifest files aren't supported. The startup time is
    #   lower when there are fewer files in the S3 bucket provided.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] split_type
    #   The method to use to split the transform job's data files into

    #   data splitting to improve performance by processing multiple
    #   concurrent mini-batches. The default value for `SplitType` is
    #   `None`, which indicates that input data files are not split, and
    #   request payloads contain the entire contents of an input object. Set
    #   the value of this parameter to `Line` to split records on a newline
    #   character boundary. `SplitType` also supports a number of
    #   record-oriented binary data formats. Currently, the supported record
    #   formats are:
    #
    #   * RecordIO
    #
    #   * TFRecord
    #
    #   When splitting is enabled, the size of a mini-batch depends on the
    #   values of the `BatchStrategy` and `MaxPayloadInMB` parameters. When
    #   the value of `BatchStrategy` is `MultiRecord`, Amazon SageMaker
    #   sends the maximum number of records in each request, up to the
    #   `MaxPayloadInMB` limit. If the value of `BatchStrategy` is
    #   `SingleRecord`, Amazon SageMaker sends individual records in each
    #   request.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Some data formats represent a record as a binary payload wrapped
    #   with extra padding bytes. When splitting is applied to a binary data
    #   format, padding is removed if the value of `BatchStrategy` is set to
    #   `SingleRecord`. Padding is not removed if the value of
    #   `BatchStrategy` is set to `MultiRecord`.
    #

    #   size of your dataset by the number of records. To ensure that the
    #   records fit within the maximum payload size, we recommend using a
    #   slightly larger value. The default value is 6 MB. For cases where
    #   the payload might be arbitrarily large and is transmitted using HTTP
    #   chunked encoding, set the value to 0. This feature works only in
