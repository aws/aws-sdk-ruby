    #     contributed to the training job.
    #
    #   * AssociatedWith - The source is connected to the destination. For
    #     example, an approval workflow is associated with a model
    #     deployment.

    #   * DerivedFrom - The destination is a modification of the source. For
    #     example, a digest output of a channel input for a processing job
    #     is derived from the original inputs.
    #
    #   * Produced - The source generated the destination. For example, a

    # @!attribute [rw] algorithm_name
    #   The name of the algorithm resource to use for the training job. This
    #   must be an algorithm resource that you created or subscribe to on
    #   Amazon Web Services Marketplace. If you specify a value for this
    #   parameter, you can't specify a value for `TrainingImage`.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] training_input_mode
    #   The training input mode that the algorithm supports. For more
    #   information about input modes, see [Algorithms][1].
    #
    #   **Pipe mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `Pipe` mode, Amazon SageMaker streams data
    #   directly from Amazon S3 to the container.
    #
    #   **File mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `File` mode, SageMaker downloads the
    #   training data from S3 to the provisioned ML storage volume, and
    #   mounts the directory to the Docker volume for the training
    #   container.
    #
    #   You must provision the ML storage volume with sufficient capacity to
    #   accommodate the data downloaded from S3. In addition to the training
    #   data, the ML storage volume also stores the output model. The
    #   algorithm container uses the ML storage volume to also store
    #   intermediate information, if any.
    #
    #   For distributed algorithms, training data is distributed uniformly.
    #   Your training duration is predictable if the input data objects
    #   sizes are approximately the same. SageMaker does not split the files
    #   any further for model training. If the object sizes are skewed,
    #   training won't be optimal as the data distribution is also skewed
    #   when one host in a training cluster is overloaded, thus becoming a
    #   bottleneck in training.
    #
    #   **FastFile mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `FastFile` mode, SageMaker streams data
    #   directly from S3 to the container with no code changes, and provides
    #   file system access to the data. Users can author their training
    #   script to interact with these files as if they were stored on disk.
    #
    #   `FastFile` mode works best when the data is read sequentially.
    #   Augmented manifest files aren't supported. The startup time is
    #   lower when there are fewer files in the S3 bucket provided.

    #       }
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] metric_name
    #   The name of the objective metric used to measure the predictive
    #   quality of a machine learning system. This metric is optimized
    #   during training to provide the best estimate for model parameter
    #   values from data.
    #
    #   Here are the options:
    #
    #   * `MSE`\: The mean squared error (MSE) is the average of the squared
    #     differences between the predicted and actual values. It is used
    #     for regression. MSE values are always positive: the better a model
    #     is at predicting the actual values, the smaller the MSE value is.
    #     When the data contains outliers, they tend to dominate the MSE,
    #     which might cause subpar prediction performance.
    #
    #   * `Accuracy`\: The ratio of the number of correctly classified items
    #     to the total number of (correctly and incorrectly) classified
    #     items. It is used for binary and multiclass classification. It
    #     measures how close the predicted class values are to the actual
    #     values. Accuracy values vary between zero and one: one indicates
    #     perfect accuracy and zero indicates perfect inaccuracy.
    #
    #   * `F1`\: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and
    #     recall. It is used for binary classification into classes
    #     traditionally referred to as positive and negative. Predictions
    #     are said to be true when they match their actual (correct) class
    #     and false when they do not. Precision is the ratio of the true
    #     positive predictions to all positive predictions (including the
    #     false positives) in a data set and measures the quality of the
    #     prediction when it predicts the positive class. Recall (or
    #     sensitivity) is the ratio of the true positive predictions to all
    #     actual positive instances and measures how completely a model
    #     predicts the actual class members in a data set. The standard F1
    #     score weighs precision and recall equally. But which metric is
    #     paramount typically depends on specific aspects of a problem. F1
    #     scores vary between zero and one: one indicates the best possible
    #     performance and zero the worst.
    #
    #   * `AUC`\: The area under the curve (AUC) metric is used to compare
    #     and evaluate binary classification by algorithms such as logistic
    #     regression that return probabilities. A threshold is needed to map
    #     the probabilities into classifications. The relevant curve is the
    #     receiver operating characteristic curve that plots the true
    #     positive rate (TPR) of predictions (or recall) against the false
    #     positive rate (FPR) as a function of the threshold value, above
    #     which a prediction is considered positive. Increasing the
    #     threshold results in fewer false positives but more false
    #     negatives. AUC is the area under this receiver operating
    #     characteristic curve and so provides an aggregated measure of the
    #     model performance across all possible classification thresholds.
    #     The AUC score can also be interpreted as the probability that a
    #     randomly selected positive data point is more likely to be
    #     predicted positive than a randomly selected negative example. AUC
    #     scores vary between zero and one: a score of one indicates perfect
    #     accuracy and a score of one half indicates that the prediction is
    #     not better than a random classifier. Values under one half predict
    #     less accurately than a random predictor. But such consistently bad
    #     predictors can simply be inverted to obtain better than random
    #     predictors.
    #
    #   * `F1macro`\: The F1macro score applies F1 scoring to multiclass
    #     classification. In this context, you have multiple classes to
    #     predict. You just calculate the precision and recall for each
    #     class as you did for the positive class in binary classification.
    #     Then, use these values to calculate the F1 score for each class
    #     and average them to obtain the F1macro score. F1macro scores vary
    #     between zero and one: one indicates the best possible performance
    #     and zero the worst.
    #
    #   If you do not specify a metric explicitly, the default behavior is
    #   to automatically use:
    #
    #   * `MSE`\: for regression.
    #
    #   * `F1`\: for binary classification
    #
    #   * `Accuracy`\: for multiclass classification.

    #   the S3 key prefix matches. If you use `ManifestFile`, the order of
    #   the S3 object references in the `ManifestFile` is shuffled. If you
    #   use `AugmentedManifestFile`, the order of the JSON lines in the
    #   `AugmentedManifestFile` is shuffled. The shuffling order is
    #   determined using the `Seed` value.
    #
    #   For Pipe input mode, shuffling is done at the start of every epoch.
    #   With large datasets this ensures that the order of the training data
    #   is different for each epoch, it helps reduce bias and possible
    #   overfitting. In a multi-node training job when ShuffleConfig is
    #   combined with `S3DataDistributionType` of `ShardedByS3Key`, the data

    #
    #   If you provide a value for this parameter, Amazon SageMaker uses
    #   Amazon Web Services Security Token Service to download model
    #   artifacts from the S3 path you provide. Amazon Web Services STS is

    #   the endpoint.
    #
    #   The KmsKeyId can be any of the following formats:
    #

    #   <note markdown="1"> Certain Nitro-based instances include local storage, dependent on
    #   the instance type. Local storage volumes are encrypted using a
    #   hardware module on the instance. You can't request a `KmsKeyId`
    #   when using an instance type with local storage. If any of the models
    #   that you specify in the `ProductionVariants` parameter use
    #   nitro-based instances with local storage, do not specify a value for
    #   the `KmsKeyId` parameter. If you specify a value for `KmsKeyId` when
    #   using any nitro-based instances with local storage, the call to
    #   `CreateEndpointConfig` fails.
    #
    #    For a list of instance types that support local instance storage,
    #   see [Instance Store Volumes][2].

    # @!attribute [rw] label_attribute_name
    #   The attribute name to use for the label in the output manifest file.
    #   This is the key for the key/value pair formed with the label that a
    #   worker assigns to the object. The `LabelAttributeName` must meet the
    #   following requirements.

    #   * The name can't end with "-metadata".
    #
    #   * If you are using one of the following [built-in task types][1],
    #     the attribute name *must* end with "-ref". If the task type you
    #     are using is not listed below, the attribute name *must not* end

    #
    #   If you are creating an adjustment or verification labeling job, you
    #   must use a *different* `LabelAttributeName` than the one used in the
    #   original labeling job. The original labeling job is the Ground Truth
    #   labeling job that produced the labels that you want verified or

    #   describes the data objects.
    #
    #   You must specify at least one of the following: `S3DataSource` or
    #   `SnsDataSource`.
    #
    #   * Use `SnsDataSource` to specify an SNS input topic for a streaming
    #     labeling job. If you do not specify and SNS input topic ARN,
    #     Ground Truth will create a one-time labeling job that stops after
    #     all data objects in the input manifest file have been labeled.
    #
    #   * Use `S3DataSource` to specify an input manifest file for both
    #     streaming and one-time labeling jobs. Adding an `S3DataSource` is
    #     optional if you use `SnsDataSource` to create a streaming labeling
    #     job.
    #
    #   If you use the Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce, your input data
    #   should not include confidential information, personal information or

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] role_arn
    #   The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) that Amazon SageMaker assumes to
    #   perform tasks on your behalf during data labeling. You must grant
    #   this role the necessary permissions so that Amazon SageMaker can
    #   successfully complete data labeling.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] label_category_config_s3_uri
    #   The S3 URI of the file, referred to as a *label category
    #   configuration file*, that defines the categories used to label the
    #   data objects.
    #
    #   For 3D point cloud and video frame task types, you can add label
    #   category attributes and frame attributes to your label category
    #   configuration file. To learn how, see [Create a Labeling Category
    #   Configuration File for 3D Point Cloud Labeling Jobs][1].
    #
    #   For named entity recognition jobs, in addition to `"labels"`, you
    #   must provide worker instructions in the label category configuration
    #   file using the `"instructions"` parameter: `"instructions":
    #   \{"shortInstruction":"<h1>Add header</h1><p>Add Instructions</p>",
    #   "fullInstruction":"<p>Add additional instructions.</p>"\}`. For
    #   details and an example, see [Create a Named Entity Recognition
    #   Labeling Job (API) ][2].
    #
    #   For all other [built-in task types][3] and [custom tasks][4], your
    #   label category configuration file must be a JSON file in the
    #   following format. Identify the labels you want to use by replacing
    #   `label_1`, `label_2`,`...`,`label_n` with your label categories.
    #
    #   `\{ `
    #
    #   `"document-version": "2018-11-28",`
    #
    #   `"labels": [\{"label": "label_1"\},\{"label":
    #   "label_2"\},...\{"label": "label_n"\}]`
    #
    #   `\}`
    #
    #   Note the following about the label category configuration file:
    #
    #   * For image classification and text classification (single and
    #     multi-label) you must specify at least two label categories. For
    #     all other task types, the minimum number of label categories
    #     required is one.
    #
    #   * Each label category must be unique, you cannot specify duplicate
    #     label categories.
    #
    #   * If you create a 3D point cloud or video frame adjustment or
    #     verification labeling job, you must include
    #     `auditLabelAttributeName` in the label category configuration. Use
    #     this parameter to enter the [ `LabelAttributeName` ][5] of the
    #     labeling job you want to adjust or verify annotations of.

    # @!attribute [rw] input_data_config
    #   An array of `Channel` objects. Each channel is a named input source.
    #   `InputDataConfig` describes the input data and its location.
    #
    #   Algorithms can accept input data from one or more channels. For
    #   example, an algorithm might have two channels of input data,
    #   `training_data` and `validation_data`. The configuration for each
    #   channel provides the S3, EFS, or FSx location where the input data
    #   is stored. It also provides information about the stored data: the
    #   MIME type, compression method, and whether the data is wrapped in
    #   RecordIO format.
    #
    #   Depending on the input mode that the algorithm supports, Amazon
    #   SageMaker either copies input data files from an S3 bucket to a
    #   local directory in the Docker container, or makes it available as
    #   input streams. For example, if you specify an EFS location, input
    #   data files will be made available as input streams. They do not need
    #   to be downloaded.

    #   The resources, including the ML compute instances and ML storage
    #   volumes, to use for model training.
    #
    #   ML storage volumes store model artifacts and incremental states.
    #   Training algorithms might also use ML storage volumes for scratch
    #   space. If you want Amazon SageMaker to use the ML storage volume to
    #   store the training data, choose `File` as the `TrainingInputMode` in

    #   Specifies a limit to how long a model training job can run. It also
    #   specifies how long a managed Spot training job has to complete. When
    #   the job reaches the time limit, Amazon SageMaker ends the training
    #   job. Use this API to cap model training costs.
    #
    #   To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm the `SIGTERM`
    #   signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can
    #   use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the
    #   results of training are not lost.
    #   @return [Types::StoppingCondition]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] tags
    #   An array of key-value pairs. You can use tags to categorize your

    #   Isolates the training container. No inbound or outbound network
    #   calls can be made, except for calls between peers within a training
    #   cluster for distributed training. If you enable network isolation
    #   for training jobs that are configured to use a VPC, Amazon SageMaker

    #   security for distributed training, but training might take longer.
    #   How long it takes depends on the amount of communication between
    #   compute instances, especially if you use a deep learning algorithm
    #   in distributed training. For more information, see [Protect

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] enable_inter_container_traffic_encryption
    #   To encrypt all communications between ML compute instances in

    #   security for distributed training, but training might take longer.
    #   How long it takes depends on the amount of communication between
    #   compute instances, especially if you use a deep learning algorithms
    #   in distributed training.

    #   wall-clock time.
    #
    #   Multiply `BillableTimeInSeconds` by the number of instances
    #   (`InstanceCount`) in your training cluster to get the total compute
    #   time SageMaker will bill you if you run distributed training. The
    #   formula is as follows: `BillableTimeInSeconds * InstanceCount` .
    #
    #   You can calculate the savings from using managed spot training using
    #   the formula `(1 - BillableTimeInSeconds / TrainingTimeInSeconds) *
    #   100`. For example, if `BillableTimeInSeconds` is 100 and
    #   `TrainingTimeInSeconds` is 500, the savings is 80%.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] training_input_mode
    #   The training input mode that the algorithm supports. For more
    #   information about input modes, see [Algorithms][1].
    #
    #   **Pipe mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `Pipe` mode, Amazon SageMaker streams data
    #   directly from Amazon S3 to the container.
    #
    #   **File mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `File` mode, SageMaker downloads the
    #   training data from S3 to the provisioned ML storage volume, and
    #   mounts the directory to the Docker volume for the training
    #   container.
    #
    #   You must provision the ML storage volume with sufficient capacity to
    #   accommodate the data downloaded from S3. In addition to the training
    #   data, the ML storage volume also stores the output model. The
    #   algorithm container uses the ML storage volume to also store
    #   intermediate information, if any.
    #
    #   For distributed algorithms, training data is distributed uniformly.
    #   Your training duration is predictable if the input data objects
    #   sizes are approximately the same. SageMaker does not split the files
    #   any further for model training. If the object sizes are skewed,
    #   training won't be optimal as the data distribution is also skewed
    #   when one host in a training cluster is overloaded, thus becoming a
    #   bottleneck in training.
    #
    #   **FastFile mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `FastFile` mode, SageMaker streams data
    #   directly from S3 to the container with no code changes, and provides
    #   file system access to the data. Users can author their training
    #   script to interact with these files as if they were stored on disk.
    #
    #   `FastFile` mode works best when the data is read sequentially.
    #   Augmented manifest files aren't supported. The startup time is
    #   lower when there are fewer files in the S3 bucket provided.

    #         "data2":[1,28,28,1]\}`
    #
    #   * `KERAS`\: You must specify the name and shape (NCHW format) of
    #     expected data inputs using a dictionary format for your trained
    #     model. Note that while Keras model artifacts should be uploaded in
    #     NHWC (channel-last) format, `DataInputConfig` should be specified

    #     for your trained model or you can specify the shape only using a
    #     list format. The dictionary formats required for the console and

    #       * If using the console, `\{"input0":[1,3,224,224]\}`
    #
    #       * If using the CLI, `\{"input0":[1,3,224,224]\}`
    #

    #
    #     * Examples for two inputs in dictionary format:
    #
    #       * If using the console, `\{"input0":[1,3,224,224],
    #         "input1":[1,3,224,224]\}`
    #
    #       * If using the CLI, `\{"input0":[1,3,224,224],

    #
    #   * `XGBOOST`\: input data name and shape are not needed.
    #
    #   `DataInputConfig` supports the following parameters for `CoreML`
    #   OutputConfig$TargetDevice (ML Model format):
    #
    #   * `shape`\: Input shape, for example `\{"input_1": \{"shape":
    #     [1,224,224,3]\}\}`. In addition to static input shapes, CoreML
    #     converter supports Flexible input shapes:
    #
    #     * Range Dimension. You can use the Range Dimension feature if you
    #       know the input shape will be within some specific interval in
    #       that dimension, for example: `\{"input_1": \{"shape": ["1..10",
    #       224, 224, 3]\}\}`
    #
    #     * Enumerated shapes. Sometimes, the models are trained to work
    #       only on a select set of inputs. You can enumerate all supported
    #       input shapes, for example: `\{"input_1": \{"shape": [[1, 224,
    #       224, 3], [1, 160, 160, 3]]\}\}`
    #
    #   * `default_shape`\: Default input shape. You can set a default shape
    #     during conversion for both Range Dimension and Enumerated Shapes.
    #     For example `\{"input_1": \{"shape": ["1..10", 224, 224, 3],
    #     "default_shape": [1, 224, 224, 3]\}\}`
    #
    #   * `type`\: Input type. Allowed values: `Image` and `Tensor`. By
    #     default, the converter generates an ML Model with inputs of type
    #     Tensor (MultiArray). User can set input type to be Image. Image
    #     input type requires additional input parameters such as `bias` and
    #     `scale`.
    #
    #   * `bias`\: If the input type is an Image, you need to provide the
    #     bias vector.
    #
    #   * `scale`\: If the input type is an Image, you need to provide a
    #     scale factor.
    #
    #   CoreML `ClassifierConfig` parameters can be specified using
    #   OutputConfig$CompilerOptions. CoreML converter supports Tensorflow
    #   and PyTorch models. CoreML conversion examples:
    #
    #   * Tensor type input:
    #
    #     * `"DataInputConfig": \{"input_1": \{"shape": [[1,224,224,3],
    #       [1,160,160,3]], "default_shape": [1,224,224,3]\}\}`
    #
    #     ^
    #
    #   * Tensor type input without input name (PyTorch):
    #
    #     * `"DataInputConfig": [\{"shape": [[1,3,224,224], [1,3,160,160]],
    #       "default_shape": [1,3,224,224]\}]`
    #
    #     ^
    #
    #   * Image type input:
    #
    #     * `"DataInputConfig": \{"input_1": \{"shape": [[1,224,224,3],
    #       [1,160,160,3]], "default_shape": [1,224,224,3], "type": "Image",
    #       "bias": [-1,-1,-1], "scale": 0.007843137255\}\}`
    #
    #     * `"CompilerOptions": \{"class_labels":
    #       "imagenet_labels_1000.txt"\}`
    #
    #   * Image type input without input name (PyTorch):
    #
    #     * `"DataInputConfig": [\{"shape": [[1,3,224,224], [1,3,160,160]],
    #       "default_shape": [1,3,224,224], "type": "Image", "bias":
    #       [-1,-1,-1], "scale": 0.007843137255\}]`
    #
    #     * `"CompilerOptions": \{"class_labels":
    #       "imagenet_labels_1000.txt"\}`
    #
    #   Depending on the model format, `DataInputConfig` requires the
    #   following parameters for `ml_eia2` [OutputConfig:TargetDevice][1].
    #
    #   * For TensorFlow models saved in the SavedModel format, specify the
    #     input names from `signature_def_key` and the input model shapes
    #     for `DataInputConfig`. Specify the `signature_def_key` in [
    #     `OutputConfig:CompilerOptions` ][2] if the model does not use
    #     TensorFlow's default signature def key. For example:
    #
    #     * `"DataInputConfig": \{"inputs": [1, 224, 224, 3]\}`
    #
    #     * `"CompilerOptions": \{"signature_def_key": "serving_custom"\}`
    #
    #   * For TensorFlow models saved as a frozen graph, specify the input
    #     tensor names and shapes in `DataInputConfig` and the output tensor
    #     names for `output_names` in [ `OutputConfig:CompilerOptions` ][2].
    #     For example:
    #
    #     * `"DataInputConfig": \{"input_tensor:0": [1, 224, 224, 3]\}`
    #
    #     * `"CompilerOptions": \{"output_names": ["output_tensor:0"]\}`

    #       compiling for ARM 32-bit platform with NEON support.
    #
    #   * `INFERENTIA`\: Compilation for target ml\_inf1 uses compiler
    #     options passed in as a JSON string. For example,
    #     `"CompilerOptions": ""--verbose 1 --num-neuroncores 2 -O2""`.
    #
    #     For information about supported compiler options, see [ Neuron
    #     Compiler CLI][1].

    #   rest using Amazon S3 server-side encryption. The `KmsKeyId` can be
    #   any of the following formats:
    #
    #   * // KMS Key ID
    #
    #     `"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"`
    #
    #   * // Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key
    #
    #     `"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"`
    #
    #   * // KMS Key Alias
    #
    #     `"alias/ExampleAlias"`
    #
    #   * // Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key Alias
    #
    #     `"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"`
    #
    #   If you use a KMS key ID or an alias of your KMS key, the Amazon
    #   SageMaker execution role must include permissions to call
    #   `kms:Encrypt`. If you don't provide a KMS key ID, Amazon SageMaker
    #   uses the default KMS key for Amazon S3 for your role's account.
    #   Amazon SageMaker uses server-side encryption with KMS-managed keys
    #   for `OutputDataConfig`. If you use a bucket policy with an
    #   `s3:PutObject` permission that only allows objects with server-side
    #   encryption, set the condition key of
    #   `s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption` to `"aws:kms"`. For more
    #   information, see [KMS-Managed Encryption Keys][1] in the *Amazon
    #   Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.*
    #
    #   The KMS key policy must grant permission to the IAM role that you
    #   specify in your `CreateEndpoint` and `UpdateEndpoint` requests. For
    #   more information, see [Using Key Policies in Amazon Web Services
    #   KMS][2] in the *Amazon Web Services Key Management Service Developer
    #   Guide*.

    #
    #   * A manifest might look like this:
    #     `s3://bucketname/example.manifest`
    #
    #     A manifest is an S3 object which is a JSON file consisting of an
    #     array of elements. The first element is a prefix which is followed
    #     by one or more suffixes. SageMaker appends the suffix elements to
    #     the prefix to get a full set of `S3Uri`. Note that the prefix must
    #     be a valid non-empty `S3Uri` that precludes users from specifying
    #     a manifest whose individual `S3Uri` is sourced from different S3
    #     buckets.
    #
    #     The following code example shows a valid manifest format:
    #
    #     `[ \{"prefix": "s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/"\},`
    #
    #     ` "relative/path/to/custdata-1",`
    #
    #     ` "relative/path/custdata-2",`
    #
    #     ` ...`
    #
    #     ` "relative/path/custdata-N"`
    #
    #     `]`
    #
    #     This JSON is equivalent to the following `S3Uri` list:
    #
    #     `s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/to/custdata-1`
    #
    #     `s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/custdata-2`
    #
    #     `...`
    #
    #     `s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/custdata-N`
    #
    #     The complete set of `S3Uri` in this manifest is the input data for

    #     following:
    #
    #     `Hourly: cron(0 * ? * * *)`
    #
    #   * If you want to start the job daily:
    #
    #     `cron(0 [00-23] ? * * *)`
    #
    #   For example, the following are valid cron expressions:
    #
    #   * Daily at noon UTC: `cron(0 12 ? * * *)`
    #
    #   * Daily at midnight UTC: `cron(0 0 ? * * *)`
    #
    #   To support running every 6, 12 hours, the following are also
    #   supported:
    #
    #   `cron(0 [00-23]/[01-24] ? * * *)`
    #
    #   For example, the following are valid cron expressions:
    #
    #   * Every 12 hours, starting at 5pm UTC: `cron(0 17/12 ? * * *)`
    #
    #   * Every two hours starting at midnight: `cron(0 0/2 ? * * *)`
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> * Even though the cron expression is set to start at 5PM UTC, note
    #     that there could be a delay of 0-20 minutes from the actual
    #     requested time to run the execution.
    #
    #   * We recommend that if you would like a daily schedule, you do not
    #     provide this parameter. Amazon SageMaker will pick a time for
    #     running every day.

    # @!attribute [rw] training_input_mode
    #   The training input mode that the algorithm supports. For more
    #   information about input modes, see [Algorithms][1].
    #
    #   **Pipe mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `Pipe` mode, Amazon SageMaker streams data
    #   directly from Amazon S3 to the container.
    #
    #   **File mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `File` mode, SageMaker downloads the
    #   training data from S3 to the provisioned ML storage volume, and
    #   mounts the directory to the Docker volume for the training
    #   container.
    #
    #   You must provision the ML storage volume with sufficient capacity to
    #   accommodate the data downloaded from S3. In addition to the training
    #   data, the ML storage volume also stores the output model. The
    #   algorithm container uses the ML storage volume to also store
    #   intermediate information, if any.
    #
    #   For distributed algorithms, training data is distributed uniformly.
    #   Your training duration is predictable if the input data objects
    #   sizes are approximately the same. SageMaker does not split the files
    #   any further for model training. If the object sizes are skewed,
    #   training won't be optimal as the data distribution is also skewed
    #   when one host in a training cluster is overloaded, thus becoming a
    #   bottleneck in training.
    #
    #   **FastFile mode**
    #
    #   If an algorithm supports `FastFile` mode, SageMaker streams data
    #   directly from S3 to the container with no code changes, and provides
    #   file system access to the data. Users can author their training
    #   script to interact with these files as if they were stored on disk.
    #
    #   `FastFile` mode works best when the data is read sequentially.
    #   Augmented manifest files aren't supported. The startup time is
    #   lower when there are fewer files in the S3 bucket provided.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] split_type
    #   The method to use to split the transform job's data files into
    #   smaller batches. Splitting is necessary when the total size of each
    #   object is too large to fit in a single request. You can also use
    #   data splitting to improve performance by processing multiple
    #   concurrent mini-batches. The default value for `SplitType` is
    #   `None`, which indicates that input data files are not split, and
    #   request payloads contain the entire contents of an input object. Set
    #   the value of this parameter to `Line` to split records on a newline
    #   character boundary. `SplitType` also supports a number of
    #   record-oriented binary data formats. Currently, the supported record
    #   formats are:
    #
    #   * RecordIO
    #
    #   * TFRecord
    #
    #   When splitting is enabled, the size of a mini-batch depends on the
    #   values of the `BatchStrategy` and `MaxPayloadInMB` parameters. When
    #   the value of `BatchStrategy` is `MultiRecord`, Amazon SageMaker
    #   sends the maximum number of records in each request, up to the
    #   `MaxPayloadInMB` limit. If the value of `BatchStrategy` is
    #   `SingleRecord`, Amazon SageMaker sends individual records in each
    #   request.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Some data formats represent a record as a binary payload wrapped
    #   with extra padding bytes. When splitting is applied to a binary data
    #   format, padding is removed if the value of `BatchStrategy` is set to
    #   `SingleRecord`. Padding is not removed if the value of
    #   `BatchStrategy` is set to `MultiRecord`.
    #
    #    For more information about `RecordIO`, see [Create a Dataset Using

    #   slightly larger value. The default value is 6 MB. For cases where
    #   the payload might be arbitrarily large and is transmitted using HTTP
    #   chunked encoding, set the value to 0. This feature works only in

    #
    #   * A manifest might look like this:
    #     `s3://bucketname/example.manifest`
    #
    #     The manifest is an S3 object which is a JSON file with the

    #     `"relative/path/custdata-N"`
    #
    #     `]`
    #
    #     The preceding JSON matches the following `S3Uris`\:
    #
    #     `s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/to/custdata-1`

    #   Workforces can be created using Amazon Cognito or your own OIDC
    #   Identity Provider (IdP). For private workforces created using Amazon
    #   Cognito use `CognitoMemberDefinition`. For workforces created using

    #   correspond to Amazon Cognito *user groups* within the user pool used
    #   to create a workforce. All of the `CognitoMemberDefinition` objects
    #   that make up the member definition must have the same `ClientId` and
    #   `UserPool` values. To add a Amazon Cognito user group to an existing
    #   worker pool, see [Adding groups to a User Pool](). For more
    #   information about user pools, see [Amazon Cognito User Pools][1].
    #
    #   For workforces created using your own OIDC IdP, specify the user
    #   groups that you want to include in your private work team in
    #   `OidcMemberDefinition` by listing those groups in `Groups`. Be aware

    #   listed in `Groups` when you make this request to remain on the work
    #   team. If you do not include these user groups, they will no longer
    #   be associated with the work team you update.
