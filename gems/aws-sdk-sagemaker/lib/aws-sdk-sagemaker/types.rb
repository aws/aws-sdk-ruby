    #
    # @!attribute [rw] training_input_mode
    #   The input mode that the algorithm supports. For the input modes that
    #   Amazon SageMaker algorithms support, see [Algorithms][1]. If an
    #   algorithm supports the `File` input mode, Amazon SageMaker downloads
    #   the training data from S3 to the provisioned ML storage Volume, and
    #   mounts the directory to docker volume for training container. If an
    #   algorithm supports the `Pipe` input mode, Amazon SageMaker streams
    #   data directly from S3 to the container.
    #
    #   In File mode, make sure you provision ML storage volume with
    #   sufficient capacity to accommodate the data download from S3. In
    #   addition to the training data, the ML storage volume also stores the
    #   output model. The algorithm container use ML storage volume to also
    #   store intermediate information, if any.
    #
    #   For distributed algorithms using File mode, training data is
    #   distributed uniformly, and your training duration is predictable if
    #   the input data objects size is approximately same. Amazon SageMaker
    #   does not split the files any further for model training. If the
    #   object sizes are skewed, training won't be optimal as the data
    #   distribution is also skewed where one host in a training cluster is
    #   overloaded, thus becoming bottleneck in training.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] input_data_config
    #   An array of `Channel` objects. Each channel is a named input source.
    #   `InputDataConfig` describes the input data and its location.
    #
    #   Algorithms can accept input data from one or more channels. For
    #   example, an algorithm might have two channels of input data,
    #   `training_data` and `validation_data`. The configuration for each
    #   channel provides the S3 location where the input data is stored. It
    #   also provides information about the stored data: the MIME type,
    #   compression method, and whether the data is wrapped in RecordIO
    #   format.
    #
    #   Depending on the input mode that the algorithm supports, Amazon
    #   SageMaker either copies input data files from an S3 bucket to a
    #   local directory in the Docker container, or makes it available as
    #   input streams.
    #   @return [Array<Types::Channel>]

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] resource_config
    #   The resources, including the ML compute instances and ML storage
    #   volumes, to use for model training.
    #
    #   ML storage volumes store model artifacts and incremental states.
    #   Training algorithms might also use ML storage volumes for scratch
    #   space. If you want Amazon SageMaker to use the ML storage volume to
    #   store the training data, choose `File` as the `TrainingInputMode` in
    #   the algorithm specification. For distributed training algorithms,
    #   specify an instance count greater than 1.

    #   A VpcConfig object that specifies the VPC that you want your
    #   training job to connect to. Control access to and from your training
    #   container by configuring the VPC. For more information, see [Protect
    #   Training Jobs by Using an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud][1].

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] stopping_condition
    #   Sets a duration for training. Use this parameter to cap model
    #   training costs. To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm
    #   the `SIGTERM` signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds.
    #   Algorithms might use this 120-second window to save the model
    #   artifacts.
    #
    #   When Amazon SageMaker terminates a job because the stopping
    #   condition has been met, training algorithms provided by Amazon
    #   SageMaker save the intermediate results of the job. This
    #   intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can use it to
    #   create a model using the `CreateModel` API.

    #   : * Downloading the training image.
    #
    #     * Training image download completed. Training in progress.
    #
    #   Status messages are subject to change. Therefore, we recommend not
    #   including them in code that programmatically initiates actions. For
    #   examples, don't use status messages in if statements.
    #
    #   To have an overview of your training job's progress, view
    #   `TrainingJobStatus` and `SecondaryStatus` in
    #   DescribeTrainingJobResponse, and `StatusMessage` together. For
    #   example, at the start of a training job, you might see the
    #   following:

    #   * `TrainingJobStatus` - InProgress
    #
    #   * `SecondaryStatus` - Training

    #   If you choose `S3Prefix`, `S3Uri` identifies a key name prefix.

    #   for batch transform.

    #   SageMaker to use for batch transform.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] s3_uri
    #   Depending on the value specified for the `S3DataType`, identifies
    #   either a key name prefix or a manifest. For example:
    #
    #   * A key name prefix might look like this:
    #     `s3://bucketname/exampleprefix`.
    #
    #   * A manifest might look like this:
    #     `s3://bucketname/example.manifest`
    #
    #     The manifest is an S3 object which is a JSON file with the
    #     following format:
    #
    #     `[`
    #
    #     ` \{"prefix": "s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/"\},`

    #     ` "relative/path/to/custdata-1",`

    #     ` "relative/path/custdata-2",`
    #
    #     ` ...`
    #
    #     ` ]`
    #
    #     The preceding JSON matches the following `S3Uris`\:
    #
    #     `s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/relative/path/to/custdata-1`
