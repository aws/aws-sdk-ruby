    #     value that you specified in either `MaxWidth` or `MaxHeight`
    #     without exceeding the other value.
    #
    #   * `Fill:` Elastic Transcoder scales the output art so it matches the
    #     value that you specified in either `MaxWidth` or `MaxHeight` and
    #     matches or exceeds the other value. Elastic Transcoder centers the
    #     output art and then crops it in the dimension (if any) that
    #     exceeds the maximum value.
    #
    #   * `Stretch:` Elastic Transcoder stretches the output art to match
    #     the values that you specified for `MaxWidth` and `MaxHeight`. If
    #     the relative proportions of the input art and the output art are
    #     different, the output art will be distorted.
    #
    #   * `Keep:` Elastic Transcoder does not scale the output art. If
    #     either dimension of the input art exceeds the values that you
    #     specified for `MaxWidth` and `MaxHeight`, Elastic Transcoder crops
    #     the output art.

    #   * `ShrinkToFit:` Elastic Transcoder scales the output art down so
    #     that its dimensions match the values that you specified for at
    #     least one of `MaxWidth` and `MaxHeight` without exceeding either
    #     value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not

    #   The method of organizing audio channels and tracks. Use
    #   `Audio:Channels` to specify the number of channels in your output,
    #   and `Audio:AudioPackingMode` to specify the number of tracks and
    #   their relation to the channels. If you do not specify an
    #   `Audio:AudioPackingMode`, Elastic Transcoder uses `SingleTrack`.
    #
    #   The following values are valid:
    #
    #   `SingleTrack`, `OneChannelPerTrack`, and
    #   `OneChannelPerTrackWithMosTo8Tracks`
    #
    #   When you specify `SingleTrack`, Elastic Transcoder creates a single
    #   track for your output. The track can have up to eight channels. Use
    #   `SingleTrack` for all non-`mxf` containers.
    #
    #   The outputs of `SingleTrack` for a specific channel value and inputs
    #   are as follows:
    #
    #   * `0` <b> channels with any input:</b> Audio omitted from the output
    #
    #   * `1, 2, or auto ` **channels with no audio input:** Audio omitted

    #   * `2 ` **channels with one track with one channel:** One track with
    #     two identical channels
    #
    #   * `2 or auto ` **channels with two tracks with one channel each:**
    #     One track with two channels
    #
    #   * `2 or auto ` **channels with one track with two channels:** One
    #     track with two channels
    #
    #   * `2 ` **channels with one track with multiple channels:** One track
    #     with two channels
    #
    #   * `auto ` **channels with one track with one channel:** One track
    #     with one channel
    #
    #   * `auto ` **channels with one track with multiple channels:** One
    #     track with multiple channels
    #
    #   When you specify `OneChannelPerTrack`, Elastic Transcoder creates a
    #   new track for every channel in your output. Your output can have up
    #   to eight single-channel tracks.
    #
    #   The outputs of `OneChannelPerTrack` for a specific channel value and
    #   inputs are as follows:

    #
    #   * `1, 2, or auto ` **channels with no audio input:** Audio omitted
    #     from the output
    #
    #   * `1 ` **channel with any input with audio:** One track with one
    #     channel, downmixed if necessary

    #   * `2 ` **channels with one track with one channel:** Two tracks with
    #     one identical channel each
    #
    #   * `2 or auto ` **channels with two tracks with one channel each:**
    #     Two tracks with one channel each
    #
    #   * `2 or auto ` **channels with one track with two channels:** Two
    #     tracks with one channel each

    #     with one channel
    #
    #   * `auto ` **channels with one track with multiple channels:** Up to
    #     eight tracks with one channel each
    #
    #   When you specify `OneChannelPerTrackWithMosTo8Tracks`, Elastic
    #   Transcoder creates eight single-channel tracks for your output. All
    #   tracks that do not contain audio data from an input channel are MOS,
    #   or Mit Out Sound, tracks.
    #
    #   The outputs of `OneChannelPerTrackWithMosTo8Tracks` for a specific

    #   * <b> <code>\{count\}</code> (Required)</b>\: If you want to create
    #     thumbnails, you must include `\{count\}` in the `ThumbnailPattern`
    #     object. Wherever you specify `\{count\}`, Elastic Transcoder adds
    #     a five-digit sequence number (beginning with **00001**) to
    #     thumbnail file names. The number indicates where a given thumbnail
    #     appears in the sequence of thumbnails for a transcoded file.
    #
    #     If you specify a literal value and/or `\{resolution\}` but you
    #     omit `\{count\}`, Elastic Transcoder returns a validation error
    #     and does not create the job.
    #
    #   * **Literal values (Optional)**\: You can specify literal values
    #     anywhere in the `ThumbnailPattern` object. For example, you can
    #     include them as a file name prefix or as a delimiter between
    #     `\{resolution\}` and `\{count\}`.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>\{resolution\}</code> (Optional)</b>\: If you want
    #     Elastic Transcoder to include the resolution in the file name,
    #     include `\{resolution\}` in the `ThumbnailPattern` object.
    #
    #   When creating thumbnails, Elastic Transcoder automatically saves the
    #   files in the format (.jpg or .png) that appears in the preset that

    #   `Container` is `fmp4` (Fragmented MP4) or `ts` (MPEG-TS),
    #   `SegmentDuration` is the target maximum duration of each segment in

    #   in a separate `.ts` file. For `HLSv4` and `Smooth` playlists, all
    #   media segments for an output are stored in a single file. Each
    #   segment is approximately the length of the `SegmentDuration`, though
    #   individual segments might be shorter or longer.

    # @!attribute [rw] captions
    #   You can configure Elastic Transcoder to transcode captions, or
    #   subtitles, from one format to another. All captions must be in
    #   UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder supports two types of captions:
    #
    #   * **Embedded:** Embedded captions are included in the same file as
    #     the audio and video. Elastic Transcoder supports only one embedded
    #     caption per language, to a maximum of 300 embedded captions per
    #     file.
    #
    #     Valid input values include: `CEA-608 (EIA-608`, first non-empty
    #     channel only), `CEA-708 (EIA-708`, first non-empty channel only),
    #     and `mov-text`
    #
    #     Valid outputs include: `mov-text`
    #
    #     Elastic Transcoder supports a maximum of one embedded format per
    #     output.
    #
    #   * **Sidecar:** Sidecar captions are kept in a separate metadata file
    #     from the audio and video data. Sidecar captions require a player
    #     that is capable of understanding the relationship between the
    #     video file and the sidecar file. Elastic Transcoder supports only
    #     one sidecar caption per language, to a maximum of 20 sidecar
    #     captions per file.
    #
    #     Valid input values include: `dfxp` (first div element only),
    #     `ebu-tt`, `scc`, `smpt`, `srt`, `ttml` (first div element only),
    #     and `webvtt`
    #
    #     Valid outputs include: `dfxp` (first div element only), `scc`,
    #     `srt`, and `webvtt`.
    #
    #   If you want ttml or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify dfxp as
    #   your output format.
    #
    #   Elastic Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical Character
    #   Recognition), does not accept pictures as a valid input for
    #   captions, and is not available for audio-only transcoding. Elastic
    #   Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for example, italics)
    #   during the transcoding process.
    #
    #   To remove captions or leave the captions empty, set `Captions` to
    #   null. To pass through existing captions unchanged, set the
    #   `MergePolicy` to `MergeRetain`, and pass in a null `CaptionSources`
    #   array.

    #   The name that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the master
    #   playlist, for example, nyc-vacation.m3u8. If the name includes a `/`
    #   character, the section of the name before the last `/` must be
    #   identical for all `Name` objects. If you create more than one master
    #   playlist, the values of all `Name` objects must be unique.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Elastic Transcoder automatically appends the relevant file extension
    #   to the file name (`.m3u8` for `HLSv3` and `HLSv4` playlists, and
    #   `.ism` and `.ismc` for `Smooth` playlists). If you include a file
    #   extension in `Name`, the file name will have two extensions.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] output_keys
    #   For each output in this job that you want to include in a master
    #   playlist, the value of the `Outputs:Key` object.
    #
    #   * If your output is not `HLS` or does not have a segment duration
    #     set, the name of the output file is a concatenation of
    #     `OutputKeyPrefix` and `Outputs:Key`\:
    #
    #     OutputKeyPrefix`Outputs:Key`
    #
    #   * If your output is `HLSv3` and has a segment duration set, or is
    #     not included in a playlist, Elastic Transcoder creates an output
    #     playlist file with a file extension of `.m3u8`, and a series of
    #     `.ts` files that include a five-digit sequential counter beginning
    #     with 00000:
    #
    #     OutputKeyPrefix`Outputs:Key`.m3u8
    #
    #     OutputKeyPrefix`Outputs:Key`00000.ts
    #
    #   * If your output is `HLSv4`, has a segment duration set, and is
    #     included in an `HLSv4` playlist, Elastic Transcoder creates an
    #     output playlist file with a file extension of `_v4.m3u8`. If the
    #     output is video, Elastic Transcoder also creates an output file
    #     with an extension of `_iframe.m3u8`\:
    #
    #     OutputKeyPrefix`Outputs:Key`\_v4.m3u8

    #   Elastic Transcoder automatically appends the relevant file extension
    #   to the file name. If you include a file extension in Output Key, the
    #   file name will have two extensions.
    #
    #   If you include more than one output in a playlist, any segment
    #   duration settings, clip settings, or caption settings must be the
    #   same for all outputs in the playlist. For `Smooth` playlists, the

    #   options:
    #
    #   * **s3:** Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used for encrypting
    #     your files.
    #
    #   * **s3-aws-kms:** Amazon S3 calls the Amazon Key Management Service,
    #     which creates and manages the keys that are used for encrypting
    #     your files. If you specify `s3-aws-kms` and you don't want to use
    #     the default key, you must add the AWS-KMS key that you want to use
    #     to your pipeline.
    #
    #   * **aes-cbc-pkcs7:** A padded cipher-block mode of operation
    #     originally used for HLS files.
    #
    #   * **aes-ctr:** AES Counter Mode.
    #
    #   * **aes-gcm:** AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode of operation that is
    #     an authenticated encryption format, meaning that a file, key, or
    #     initialization vector that has been tampered with fails the
    #     decryption process.
    #
    #   For all three AES options, you must provide the following settings,
    #   which must be base64-encoded:
    #
    #   * **Key**
    #
    #   * **Key MD5**
    #
    #   * **Initialization Vector**
    #
    #   For the AES modes, your private encryption keys and your unencrypted
    #   data are never stored by AWS; therefore, it is important that you
    #   safely manage your encryption keys. If you lose them, you won't be

    #     the audio and video. Elastic Transcoder supports only one embedded
    #     caption per language, to a maximum of 300 embedded captions per
    #     file.
    #
    #     Valid input values include: `CEA-608 (EIA-608`, first non-empty

    #
    #     Valid outputs include: `mov-text`
    #
    #     Elastic Transcoder supports a maximum of one embedded format per
    #     output.
    #
    #   * **Sidecar:** Sidecar captions are kept in a separate metadata file
    #     from the audio and video data. Sidecar captions require a player
    #     that is capable of understanding the relationship between the
    #     video file and the sidecar file. Elastic Transcoder supports only
    #     one sidecar caption per language, to a maximum of 20 sidecar
    #     captions per file.
    #
    #     Valid input values include: `dfxp` (first div element only),
    #     `ebu-tt`, `scc`, `smpt`, `srt`, `ttml` (first div element only),
    #     and `webvtt`
    #
    #     Valid outputs include: `dfxp` (first div element only), `scc`,
    #     `srt`, and `webvtt`.
    #
    #   If you want ttml or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify dfxp as
    #   your output format.
    #
    #   Elastic Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical Character
    #   Recognition), does not accept pictures as a valid input for
    #   captions, and is not available for audio-only transcoding. Elastic
    #   Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for example, italics)
    #   during the transcoding process.
    #
    #   To remove captions or leave the captions empty, set `Captions` to
    #   null. To pass through existing captions unchanged, set the
    #   `MergePolicy` to `MergeRetain`, and pass in a null `CaptionSources`

    #   * <b> <code>\{count\}</code> (Required)</b>\: If you want to create
    #     thumbnails, you must include `\{count\}` in the `ThumbnailPattern`
    #     object. Wherever you specify `\{count\}`, Elastic Transcoder adds
    #     a five-digit sequence number (beginning with **00001**) to
    #     thumbnail file names. The number indicates where a given thumbnail
    #     appears in the sequence of thumbnails for a transcoded file.
    #
    #     If you specify a literal value and/or `\{resolution\}` but you
    #     omit `\{count\}`, Elastic Transcoder returns a validation error
    #     and does not create the job.
    #
    #   * **Literal values (Optional)**\: You can specify literal values
    #     anywhere in the `ThumbnailPattern` object. For example, you can
    #     include them as a file name prefix or as a delimiter between
    #     `\{resolution\}` and `\{count\}`.
    #
    #   * <b> <code>\{resolution\}</code> (Optional)</b>\: If you want
    #     Elastic Transcoder to include the resolution in the file name,
    #     include `\{resolution\}` in the `ThumbnailPattern` object.
    #
    #   When creating thumbnails, Elastic Transcoder automatically saves the
    #   files in the format (.jpg or .png) that appears in the preset that
    #   you specified in the `PresetID` value of `CreateJobOutput`. Elastic
    #   Transcoder also appends the applicable file name extension.

    #   The value of the `Id` object for the preset that you want to use for
    #   this job. The preset determines the audio, video, and thumbnail
    #   settings that Elastic Transcoder uses for transcoding. To use a

    #   If you specify a preset in `PresetId` for which the value of
    #   `Container` is `fmp4` (Fragmented MP4) or `ts` (MPEG-TS),
    #   `SegmentDuration` is the target maximum duration of each segment in

    #   For example, if you specify `Top` for `VerticalAlign` and `5px` for
    #   `VerticalOffset`, the top of the watermark appears 5 pixels from the
    #   top border of the output video.
    #
    #   `VerticalOffset` is only valid when the value of VerticalAlign is
    #   Top or Bottom.
    #
    #   If you specify an offset that causes the watermark to extend beyond
    #   the top or bottom border and Elastic Transcoder has not added black
    #   bars, the watermark is cropped. If Elastic Transcoder has added
    #   black bars, the watermark extends into the black bars. If the
    #   watermark extends beyond the black bars, it is cropped.
    #
    #   Use the value of `Target` to specify whether you want Elastic
    #   Transcoder to include the black bars that are added by Elastic
    #   Transcoder, if any, in the offset calculation.

    #   the video in the specified location). The datatype of `Opacity` is
    #   float.

    #   Elastic Transcoder supports transparent .png graphics. If you use a
    #   transparent .png, the transparent portion of the video appears as if

    #   **Profile (H.264/VP8/VP9 Only)**
    #
    #   The H.264 profile that you want to use for the output file. Elastic
    #   Transcoder supports the following profiles:
    #
    #   * `baseline`\: The profile most commonly used for videoconferencing
    #     and for mobile applications.
    #
    #   * `main`\: The profile used for standard-definition digital TV
    #     broadcasts.
    #
    #   * `high`\: The profile used for high-definition digital TV
    #     broadcasts and for Blu-ray discs.
    #
    #   **Level (H.264 Only)**
    #
    #   The H.264 level that you want to use for the output file. Elastic
    #   Transcoder supports the following levels:
    #
    #   `1`, `1b`, `1.1`, `1.2`, `1.3`, `2`, `2.1`, `2.2`, `3`, `3.1`,
    #   `3.2`, `4`, `4.1`
    #
    #   **MaxReferenceFrames (H.264 Only)**
    #
    #   Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is H.264. The maximum
    #   number of previously decoded frames to use as a reference for
    #   decoding future frames. Valid values are integers 0 through 16, but
    #   we recommend that you not use a value greater than the following:
    #
    #   `Min(Floor(Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks * 256 /
    #   (Width in pixels * Height in pixels)), 16)`
    #
    #   where *Width in pixels* and *Height in pixels* represent either
    #   MaxWidth and MaxHeight, or Resolution. *Maximum decoded picture
    #   buffer in macroblocks* depends on the value of the `Level` object.
    #   See the list below. (A macroblock is a block of pixels measuring
    #   16x16.)

    #   * 4\.1 - 32768
    #
    #   **MaxBitRate (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)**
    #
    #   The maximum number of bits per second in a video buffer; the size of
    #   the buffer is specified by `BufferSize`. Specify a value between 16
    #   and 62,500. You can reduce the bandwidth required to stream a video
    #   by reducing the maximum bit rate, but this also reduces the quality
    #   of the video.
    #
    #   **BufferSize (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)**
    #
    #   The maximum number of bits in any x seconds of the output video.
    #   This window is commonly 10 seconds, the standard segment duration
    #   when you're using FMP4 or MPEG-TS for the container type of the
    #   output video. Specify an integer greater than 0. If you specify
    #   `MaxBitRate` and omit `BufferSize`, Elastic Transcoder sets
    #   `BufferSize` to 10 times the value of `MaxBitRate`.
    #
    #   **InterlacedMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)**
    #
    #   The interlace mode for the output video.
    #
    #   Interlaced video is used to double the perceived frame rate for a
    #   video by interlacing two fields (one field on every other line, the
    #   other field on the other lines) so that the human eye registers
    #   multiple pictures per frame. Interlacing reduces the bandwidth
    #   required for transmitting a video, but can result in blurred images
    #   and flickering.
    #
    #   Valid values include `Progressive` (no interlacing, top to bottom),
    #   `TopFirst` (top field first), `BottomFirst` (bottom field first),
    #   and `Auto`.
    #
    #   If `InterlaceMode` is not specified, Elastic Transcoder uses
    #   `Progressive` for the output. If `Auto` is specified, Elastic
    #   Transcoder interlaces the output.
    #
    #   **ColorSpaceConversionMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)**
    #
    #   The color space conversion Elastic Transcoder applies to the output
    #   video. Color spaces are the algorithms used by the computer to store
    #   information about how to render color. `Bt.601` is the standard for
    #   standard definition video, while `Bt.709` is the standard for high
    #   definition video.
    #
    #   Valid values include `None`, `Bt709toBt601`, `Bt601toBt709`, and
    #   `Auto`.
    #
    #   If you chose `Auto` for `ColorSpaceConversionMode` and your output
    #   is interlaced, your frame rate is one of `23.97`, `24`, `25`,
    #   `29.97`, `50`, or `60`, your `SegmentDuration` is null, and you are
    #   using one of the resolution changes from the list below, Elastic
    #   Transcoder applies the following color space conversions:
    #
    #   * *Standard to HD, 720x480 to 1920x1080* - Elastic Transcoder
    #     applies `Bt601ToBt709`
    #
    #   * *Standard to HD, 720x576 to 1920x1080* - Elastic Transcoder
    #     applies `Bt601ToBt709`
    #
    #   * *HD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x480* - Elastic Transcoder
    #     applies `Bt709ToBt601`
    #
    #   * *HD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x576* - Elastic Transcoder
    #     applies `Bt709ToBt601`
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Elastic Transcoder may change the behavior of the
    #   `ColorspaceConversionMode` `Auto` mode in the future. All outputs in
    #   a playlist must use the same `ColorSpaceConversionMode`.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   If you do not specify a `ColorSpaceConversionMode`, Elastic
    #   Transcoder does not change the color space of a file. If you are
    #   unsure what `ColorSpaceConversionMode` was applied to your output
    #   file, you can check the `AppliedColorSpaceConversion` parameter
    #   included in your job response. If your job does not have an
    #   `AppliedColorSpaceConversion` in its response, no
    #   `ColorSpaceConversionMode` was applied.
    #
    #   **ChromaSubsampling**
    #
    #   The sampling pattern for the chroma (color) channels of the output
    #   video. Valid values include `yuv420p` and `yuv422p`.
    #
    #   `yuv420p` samples the chroma information of every other horizontal
    #   and every other vertical line, `yuv422p` samples the color
    #   information of every horizontal line and every other vertical line.
    #
    #   **LoopCount (Gif Only)**
    #
    #   The number of times you want the output gif to loop. Valid values
    #   include `Infinite` and integers between `0` and `100`, inclusive.
    #   @return [Hash<String,String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] keyframes_max_dist
    #   Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of `H.264`,
    #   `MPEG2`, or `VP8`.
    #
    #   The maximum number of frames between key frames. Key frames are
    #   fully encoded frames; the frames between key frames are encoded
    #   based, in part, on the content of the key frames. The value is an
    #   integer formatted as a string; valid values are between 1 (every
    #   frame is a key frame) and 100000, inclusive. A higher value results
    #   in higher compression but may also discernibly decrease video
    #   quality.

    #   For `Smooth` outputs, the `FrameRate` must have a constant ratio to
    #   the `KeyframesMaxDist`. This allows `Smooth` playlists to switch
    #   between different quality levels while the file is being played.
    #
    #   For example, an input file can have a `FrameRate` of 30 with a
    #   `KeyframesMaxDist` of 90. The output file then needs to have a ratio
    #   of 1:3. Valid outputs would have `FrameRate` of 30, 25, and 10, and
    #   `KeyframesMaxDist` of 90, 75, and 30, respectively.
    #
    #   Alternately, this can be achieved by setting `FrameRate` to auto and
    #   having the same values for `MaxFrameRate` and `KeyframesMaxDist`.

    #   * `Fill`\: Elastic Transcoder scales the output video so it matches
    #     the value that you specified in either `MaxWidth` or `MaxHeight`
    #     and matches or exceeds the other value. Elastic Transcoder centers
    #     the output video and then crops it in the dimension (if any) that

    #     that its dimensions match the values that you specified for at
    #     least one of `MaxWidth` and `MaxHeight` without exceeding either
    #     value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not
