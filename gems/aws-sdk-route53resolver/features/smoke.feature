Feature: Smoke tests for Route53Resolver

  @route53resolver @smoke
  Scenario: ListResolverEndpointsSuccess
    Given I create a 'Aws::Route53Resolver' client with config:
      """
{"region":"us-west-2"}
      """
    When I call the operation 'list_resolver_endpoints' with params:
      """
{}
      """
    Then I expect an error was not raised
