    #   The name of the parameter that you want to use to filter objects.

    #   [ListResolverQueryLogConfigs][4], or
    #   [ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations][5].
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> In early versions of Resolver, values for `Name` were listed as
    #   uppercase, with underscore (\_) delimiters. For example,
    #   `CreatorRequestId` was originally listed as `CREATOR_REQUEST_ID`.
    #   Uppercase values for `Name` are still supported.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   **ListResolverEndpoints**
    #
    #   Valid values for `Name` include the following:
    #
    #   * `CreatorRequestId`\: The value that you specified when you created
    #     the Resolver endpoint.
    #
    #   * `Direction`\: Whether you want to return inbound or outbound

    #
    #   * `HostVPCId`\: The ID of the VPC that inbound DNS queries pass
    #     through on the way from your network to your VPCs in a region, or
    #     the VPC that outbound queries pass through on the way from your
    #     VPCs to your network. In a [CreateResolverEndpoint][6] request,
    #     `SubnetId` indirectly identifies the VPC. In a
    #     [GetResolverEndpoint][7] request, the VPC ID for a Resolver
    #     endpoint is returned in the `HostVPCId` element.
    #
    #   * `IpAddressCount`\: The number of IP addresses that you have
    #     associated with the Resolver endpoint.
    #
    #   * `Name`\: The name of the Resolver endpoint.
    #
    #   * `SecurityGroupIds`\: The IDs of the VPC security groups that you
    #     specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.
    #

    #     `Status` for `Name`, specify one of the following status codes for
    #     `Values`\: `CREATING`, `OPERATIONAL`, `UPDATING`,
    #     `AUTO_RECOVERING`, `ACTION_NEEDED`, or `DELETING`. For more
    #     information, see `Status` in [ResolverEndpoint][8].
    #
    #   **ListResolverRules**
    #
    #   Valid values for `Name` include the following:
    #
    #   * `CreatorRequestId`\: The value that you specified when you created
    #     the Resolver rule.
    #
    #   * `DomainName`\: The domain name for which Resolver is forwarding
    #     DNS queries to your network. In the value that you specify for
    #     `Values`, include a trailing dot (.) after the domain name. For
    #     example, if the domain name is example.com, specify the following
    #     value. Note the "." after `com`\:
    #
    #     `example.com.`
    #
    #   * `Name`\: The name of the Resolver rule.
    #
    #   * `ResolverEndpointId`\: The ID of the Resolver endpoint that the

    #   * `Status`\: The status of the Resolver rule. If you specify
    #     `Status` for `Name`, specify one of the following status codes for
    #     `Values`\: `COMPLETE`, `DELETING`, `UPDATING`, or `FAILED`.
    #

    #   Valid values for `Name` include the following:
    #
    #   * `Name`\: The name of the Resolver rule association.

    #   A code that specifies the current status of the Resolver endpoint.
    #   Valid values include the following:
    #
    #   * `CREATING`\: Resolver is creating and configuring one or more
    #     Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint.
    #
    #   * `OPERATIONAL`\: The Amazon VPC network interfaces for this
    #     endpoint are correctly configured and able to pass inbound or
    #     outbound DNS queries between your network and Resolver.
    #
    #   * `UPDATING`\: Resolver is associating or disassociating one or more
    #     network interfaces with this endpoint.
    #
    #   * `AUTO_RECOVERING`\: Resolver is trying to recover one or more of
    #     the network interfaces that are associated with this endpoint.
    #     During the recovery process, the endpoint functions with limited
    #     capacity because of the limit on the number of DNS queries per IP
    #     address (per network interface). For the current limit, see
    #     [Limits on Route 53 Resolver][1].
    #
    #   * `ACTION_NEEDED`\: This endpoint is unhealthy, and Resolver can't
    #     automatically recover it. To resolve the problem, we recommend
    #     that you check each IP address that you associated with the
    #     endpoint. For each IP address that isn't available, add another
    #     IP address and then delete the IP address that isn't available.
    #     (An endpoint must always include at least two IP addresses.) A
    #     status of `ACTION_NEEDED` can have a variety of causes. Here are
    #     two common causes:
    #
    #     * One or more of the network interfaces that are associated with
    #       the endpoint were deleted using Amazon VPC.
    #
    #     * The network interface couldn't be created for some reason
    #       that's outside the control of Resolver.
    #
    #   * `DELETING`\: Resolver is deleting this endpoint and the associated
    #     network interfaces.
