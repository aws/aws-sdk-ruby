    #   The current membership status of the member account. The status can
    #   have one of the following values:
    #
    #   * `INVITED` - For invited accounts only. Indicates that the member
    #     was sent an invitation but has not yet responded.
    #
    #   * `VERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS` - For invited accounts only, indicates
    #     that Detective is verifying that the account identifier and email
    #     address provided for the member account match. If they do match,
    #     then Detective sends the invitation. If the email address and
    #     account identifier don't match, then the member cannot be added
    #     to the behavior graph.
    #
    #     For organization accounts in the organization behavior graph,
    #     indicates that Detective is verifying that the account belongs to
    #     the organization.
    #
    #   * `VERIFICATION_FAILED` - For invited accounts only. Indicates that
    #     the account and email address provided for the member account do
    #     not match, and Detective did not send an invitation to the
    #     account.
    #
    #   * `ENABLED` - Indicates that the member account currently
    #     contributes data to the behavior graph. For invited accounts, the
    #     member account accepted the invitation. For organization accounts
    #     in the organization behavior graph, the Detective administrator
    #     account enabled the organization account as a member account.
    #
    #   * `ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED` - The account accepted the invitation, or
    #     was enabled by the Detective administrator account, but is
    #     prevented from contributing data to the behavior graph.
    #     `DisabledReason` provides the reason why the member account is not
    #     enabled.
    #
    #   Invited accounts that declined an invitation or that were removed
    #   from the behavior graph are not included. In the organization
    #   behavior graph, organization accounts that the Detective
    #   administrator account did not enable are not included.

    # @!attribute [rw] disabled_reason
    #   For member accounts with a status of `ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED`, the
    #   reason that the member account is not enabled.
    #
    #   The reason can have one of the following values:
    #
    #   * `VOLUME_TOO_HIGH` - Indicates that adding the member account would
    #     cause the data volume for the behavior graph to be too high.
    #
    #   * `VOLUME_UNKNOWN` - Indicates that Detective is unable to verify
    #     the data volume for the member account. This is usually because
    #     the member account is not enrolled in Amazon GuardDuty.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] invited_time
    #   For invited accounts, the date and time that Detective sent the
    #   invitation to the account. The value is an ISO8601 formatted string.
    #   For example, `2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z`.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] percent_of_graph_utilization
    #   The member account data volume as a percentage of the maximum
    #   allowed data volume. 0 indicates 0 percent, and 100 indicates 100
    #   percent.
    #
    #   Note that this is not the percentage of the behavior graph data
    #   volume.
    #
    #   For example, the data volume for the behavior graph is 80 GB per
    #   day. The maximum data volume is 160 GB per day. If the data volume
    #   for the member account is 40 GB per day, then
    #   `PercentOfGraphUtilization` is 25. It represents 25% of the maximum
    #   allowed data volume.
