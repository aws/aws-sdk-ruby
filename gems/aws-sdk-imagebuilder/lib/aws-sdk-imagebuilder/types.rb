    # Image Builder does not automatically install the Systems Manager agent
    # on Windows instances. If your base image includes the Systems Manager
    # agent, then the AMI that you create will also include the agent. For
    # Linux instances, if the base image does not already include the
    # Systems Manager agent, Image Builder installs it. For Linux instances

    #   Builder might have added to ensure that Systems Manager is installed
    #   on your Linux build instance. If you override the user data, make

    #   positive integer value, including zero, with an upper limit of
    #   2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder automatically

    #    **Patterns:** You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the

    #   or a date, such as 2021.01.01.

    #   positive integer value, including zero, with an upper limit of
    #   2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder automatically
    #   assigns the build number to the fourth node.
    #
    #    **Patterns:** You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the
    #   assignment requirements for the nodes that you can assign. For
    #   example, you might choose a software version pattern, such as 1.0.0,
    #   or a date, such as 2021.01.01.

    #    **Assignment:** For the first three nodes you can assign any
    #   positive integer value, including zero, with an upper limit of
    #   2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder automatically
    #   assigns the build number to the fourth node.
    #
    #    **Patterns:** You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the
    #   assignment requirements for the nodes that you can assign. For
    #   example, you might choose a software version pattern, such as 1.0.0,
    #   or a date, such as 2021.01.01.

    #    **Filtering:** With semantic versioning, you have the flexibility to

    #   selecting the base image or components for your recipe. When you use
    #   a wildcard in any node, all nodes to the right of the first wildcard
