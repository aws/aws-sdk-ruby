    #
    # The following are common error codes that you might receive from other
    # Amazon Web Services services:
    #
    # * **InternalServiceException** – This can mean that the Resource
    #   Groups Tagging API didn't receive a response from another Amazon
    #   Web Services service. It can also mean that the resource type in the
    #   request is not supported by the Resource Groups Tagging API. In
    #   these cases, it's safe to retry the request and then call
    #   [GetResources][1] to verify the changes.
    #
    # * **AccessDeniedException** – This can mean that you need permission
    #   to call the tagging operations in the Amazon Web Services service
    #   that contains the resource. For example, to use the Resource Groups
    #   Tagging API to tag a Amazon CloudWatch alarm resource, you need
    #   permission to call both [ `TagResources` ][2] *and* [ `TagResource`
    #   ][3] in the CloudWatch API.
    #
    # For more information on errors that are generated from other Amazon
    # Web Services services, see the documentation for that service.

    #   parameter empty in your initial request.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] tag_filters
    #   Specifies a list of TagFilters (keys and values) to restrict the
    #   output to only those resources that have tags with the specified
    #   keys and, if included, the specified values. Each `TagFilter` must
    #   contain a key with values optional. A request can include up to 50
    #   keys, and each key can include up to 20 values.
    #
    #   Note the following when deciding how to use TagFilters:
    #
    #   * If you *don't* specify a `TagFilter`, the response includes all
    #     resources that are currently tagged or ever had a tag. Resources
    #     that currently don't have tags are shown with an empty tag set,
    #     like this: `"Tags": []`.
    #
    #   * If you specify more than one filter in a single request, the
    #     response returns only those resources that satisfy all filters.
    #
    #   * If you specify a filter that contains more than one value for a
    #     key, the response returns resources that match *any* of the
    #     specified values for that key.
    #
    #   * If you don't specify a value for a key, the response returns all
    #     resources that are tagged with that key, with any or no value.
    #
    #     For example, for the following filters: `filter1=
    #     \{keyA,\{value1\}\}`, `filter2=\{keyB,\{value2,value3,value4\}\}`,
    #     `filter3= \{keyC\}`:
    #
    #     * `GetResources(\{filter1\})` returns resources tagged with
    #       `key1=value1`
    #
    #     * `GetResources(\{filter2\})` returns resources tagged with
    #       `key2=value2` or `key2=value3` or `key2=value4`
    #
    #     * `GetResources(\{filter3\})` returns resources tagged with any
    #       tag with the key `key3`, and with any or no value
    #
    #     * `GetResources(\{filter1,filter2,filter3\})` returns resources
    #       tagged with `(key1=value1) and (key2=value2 or key2=value3 or
    #       key2=value4) and (key3, any or no value)`
    #   @return [Array<Types::TagFilter>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] resources_per_page
    #   Specifies the maximum number of results to be returned in each page.
    #   A query can return fewer than this maximum, even if there are more
    #   results still to return. You should always check the
    #   `PaginationToken` response value to see if there are more results.
    #   You can specify a minimum of 1 and a maximum value of 100.
    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] tags_per_page
    #   Amazon Web Services recommends using `ResourcesPerPage` instead of
    #   this parameter.
    #
    #   A limit that restricts the number of tags (key and value pairs)
    #   returned by `GetResources` in paginated output. A resource with no
    #   tags is counted as having one tag (one key and value pair).
    #
    #   `GetResources` does not split a resource and its associated tags
    #   across pages. If the specified `TagsPerPage` would cause such a
    #   break, a `PaginationToken` is returned in place of the affected
    #   resource and its tags. Use that token in another request to get the
    #   remaining data. For example, if you specify a `TagsPerPage` of `100`
    #   and the account has 22 resources with 10 tags each (meaning that
    #   each resource has 10 key and value pairs), the output will consist
    #   of three pages. The first page displays the first 10 resources, each
    #   with its 10 tags. The second page displays the next 10 resources,
    #   each with its 10 tags. The third page displays the remaining 2
    #   resources, each with its 10 tags.
    #
    #   You can set `TagsPerPage` to a minimum of 100 items up to a maximum
    #   of 500 items.
    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] resource_type_filters
    #   Specifies the resource types that you want included in the response.
    #   The format of each resource type is `service[:resourceType]`. For
    #   example, specifying a resource type of `ec2` returns all Amazon EC2
    #   resources (which includes EC2 instances). Specifying a resource type
    #   of `ec2:instance` returns only EC2 instances.
    #
    #   The string for each service name and resource type is the same as
    #   that embedded in a resource's Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For the
    #   list of services whose resources you can use in this parameter, see
    #   [Services that support the Resource Groups Tagging API][1].
    #
    #   You can specify multiple resource types by using an array. The array
    #   can include up to 100 items. Note that the length constraint
    #   requirement applies to each resource type filter. For example, the
    #   following string would limit the response to only Amazon EC2
    #   instances, Amazon S3 buckets, or any Audit Manager resource:
    #
    #   `ec2:instance,s3:bucket,auditmanager`
    #
    #
    #
    #   [1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/supported-services.html
    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] include_compliance_details
    #   Specifies whether to include details regarding the compliance with
    #   the effective tag policy. Set this to `true` to determine whether
    #   resources are compliant with the tag policy and to get details.
    #   @return [Boolean]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] exclude_compliant_resources
    #   Specifies whether to exclude resources that are compliant with the
    #   tag policy. Set this to `true` if you are interested in retrieving
    #   information on noncompliant resources only.
    #
    #   You can use this parameter only if the `IncludeComplianceDetails`
    #   parameter is also set to `true`.
    #   @return [Boolean]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] resource_arn_list
    #   Specifies a list of ARNs of resources for which you want to retrieve
    #   tag data. You can't specify both this parameter and any of the
    #   pagination parameters (`ResourcesPerPage`, `TagsPerPage`,
    #   `PaginationToken`) in the same request. If you specify both, you get
    #   an `Invalid Parameter` exception.
    #
    #   If a resource specified by this parameter doesn't exist, it
    #   doesn't generate an error; it simply isn't included in the
    #   response.
    #
    #   An ARN (Amazon Resource Name) uniquely identifies a resource. For
