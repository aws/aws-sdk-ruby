    # An entitlement represents capacity in a product owned by the customer.
    # For example, a customer might own some number of users or seats in an
    # SaaS application or some amount of data capacity in a multi-tenant
    # database.
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] product_code
    #   The product code for which the given entitlement applies. Product
    #   codes are provided by AWS Marketplace when the product listing is
    #   created.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] dimension
    #   The dimension for which the given entitlement applies. Dimensions
    #   represent categories of capacity in a product and are specified when
    #   the product is listed in AWS Marketplace.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] customer_identifier
    #   The customer identifier is a handle to each unique customer in an
    #   application. Customer identifiers are obtained through the
    #   ResolveCustomer operation in AWS Marketplace Metering Service.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] value
    #   The EntitlementValue represents the amount of capacity that the
    #   customer is entitled to for the product.
    #   @return [Types::EntitlementValue]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] expiration_date
    #   The expiration date represents the minimum date through which this
    #   entitlement is expected to remain valid. For contractual products
    #   listed on AWS Marketplace, the expiration date is the date at which
    #   the customer will renew or cancel their contract. Customers who are
    #   opting to renew their contract will still have entitlements with an
    #   expiration date.
    #   @return [Time]
