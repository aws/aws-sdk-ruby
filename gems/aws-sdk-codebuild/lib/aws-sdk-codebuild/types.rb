    #
    #     * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred**
    #       setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading

    #   these objects.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> To use this property, your CodeBuild service role must have the

    #     uploading account retains ownership of the objects.
    #
    #   FULL
    #
    #   : The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership
    #     is determined by the following criteria:
    #
    #     * If the bucket is configured with the **Bucket owner preferred**
    #       setting, the bucket owner owns the objects. The uploading
    #       account will have object access as specified by the bucket's
