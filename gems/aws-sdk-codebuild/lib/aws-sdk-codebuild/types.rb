    # @!attribute [rw] pattern
    #   For a `WebHookFilter` that uses `EVENT` type, a comma-separated
    #   string that specifies one or more events. For example, the webhook
    #   filter `PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED` allows all
    #   push, pull request created, and pull request updated events to
    #   trigger a build.
    #
    #   For a `WebHookFilter` that uses any of the other filter types, a
    #   regular expression pattern. For example, a `WebHookFilter` that uses
    #   `HEAD_REF` for its `type` and the pattern `^refs/heads/` triggers a
    #   build when the head reference is a branch with a reference name
    #   `refs/heads/branch-name`.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] exclude_matched_pattern
    #   Used to indicate that the `pattern` determines which webhook events
    #   do not trigger a build. If true, then a webhook event that does not
    #   match the `pattern` triggers a build. If false, then a webhook event
    #   that matches the `pattern` triggers a build.
