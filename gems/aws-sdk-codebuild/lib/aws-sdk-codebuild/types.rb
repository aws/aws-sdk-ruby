    #     secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent builds
    #     pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice
    #     for projects with a clean working directory and a source that is a

    #   * `LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE` mode caches existing Docker layers.
    #     This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large
    #     Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by
    #     pulling large Docker images down from the network.
    #

    #   The type of webhook filter. There are five webhook filter types:

    #   EVENT
    #
    #   : A webhook event triggers a build when the provided `pattern`
    #     matches one of four event types: `PUSH`, `PULL_REQUEST_CREATED`,
    #     `PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED`, and `PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED`. The `EVENT`
    #     patterns are specified as a comma-separated string. For example,
    #     `PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED` filters all
    #     push, pull request created, and pull request updated events.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> The `PULL_REQUEST_REOPENED` works with GitHub and GitHub
    #     Enterprise only.
    #
    #      </note>

    #   ACTOR\_ACCOUNT\_ID
    #
    #   : A webhook event triggers a build when a GitHub, GitHub Enterprise,
    #     or Bitbucket account ID matches the regular expression `pattern`.
    #
    #   HEAD\_REF
    #
    #   : A webhook event triggers a build when the head reference matches
    #     the regular expression `pattern`. For example,
    #     `refs/heads/branch-name` and `refs/tags/tag-name`.
    #
    #     Works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise push, GitHub and GitHub
    #     Enterprise pull request, Bitbucket push, and Bitbucket pull
    #     request events.
    #
    #   BASE\_REF
    #
    #   : A webhook event triggers a build when the base reference matches
    #     the regular expression `pattern`. For example,
    #     `refs/heads/branch-name`.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Works with pull request events only.

    #   : A webhook triggers a build when the path of a changed file matches
    #     the regular expression `pattern`.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise push events only.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] pattern
    #   For a `WebHookFilter` that uses `EVENT` type, a comma-separated
    #   string that specifies one or more events. For example, the webhook
    #   filter `PUSH, PULL_REQUEST_CREATED, PULL_REQUEST_UPDATED` allows all
    #   push, pull request created, and pull request updated events to
    #   trigger a build.
    #
    #   For a `WebHookFilter` that uses any of the other filter types, a
    #   regular expression pattern. For example, a `WebHookFilter` that uses
    #   `HEAD_REF` for its `type` and the pattern `^refs/heads/` triggers a
    #   build when the head reference is a branch with a reference name
    #   `refs/heads/branch-name`.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] exclude_matched_pattern
    #   Used to indicate that the `pattern` determines which webhook events
    #   do not trigger a build. If true, then a webhook event that does not
