    #

    #
    #   * For source code settings that are specified in the source action
    #     of a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline, `location` should not be
    #     specified. If it is specified, AWS CodePipeline will ignore it.
    #     This is because AWS CodePipeline uses the settings in a
    #     pipeline's source action instead of this value.
    #
    #   * For source code in an AWS CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone
    #     URL to the repository that contains the source code and the build
    #     spec (for example,
    #     `https://git-codecommit.region-ID.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/repo-name
    #     `).

    #   * For source code in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
    #     input bucket, the path to the ZIP file that contains the source
    #     code (for example, ` bucket-name/path/to/object-name.zip`)
    #
    #   * For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the
    #     repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also, you
    #     must connect your AWS account to your GitHub account. To do this,
    #     use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build project.
    #     When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on
    #     the GitHub **Authorize application** page that displays, for
    #     **Organization access**, choose **Request access** next to each
    #     repository you want to allow AWS CodeBuild to have access to. Then
    #     choose **Authorize application**. (After you have connected to
    #     your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build
    #     project, and you may then leave the AWS CodeBuild console.) To
    #     instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this connection, in the
    #     `source` object, set the `auth` object's `type` value to `OAUTH`.
    #
    #   * For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to
    #     the repository that contains the source and the build spec. Also,
    #     you must connect your AWS account to your Bitbucket account. To do
    #     this, use the AWS CodeBuild console to begin creating a build
    #     project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with
    #     Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account**
    #     page that displays, choose **Grant access**. (After you have
    #     connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish
    #     creating the build project, and you may then leave the AWS
    #     CodeBuild console.) To instruct AWS CodeBuild to then use this
