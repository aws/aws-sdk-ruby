    #   {#data} on an unloaded resource will trigger a call to {#load}.
    def data_loaded?
      !!@data
    end

    # @deprecated Use [Aws::RDS::Client] #wait_until instead
    #
    # Waiter polls an API operation until a resource enters a desired
    # state.
    #
    # @note The waiting operation is performed on a copy. The original resource
    #   remains unchanged.
    #
    # ## Basic Usage
    #
    # Waiter will polls until it is successful, it fails by
    # entering a terminal state, or until a maximum number of attempts
    # are made.
    #
    #     # polls in a loop until condition is true
    #     resource.wait_until(options) {|resource| condition}
    #
    # ## Example
    #
    #     instance.wait_until(max_attempts:10, delay:5) do |instance|
    #       instance.state.name == 'running'
    #     end
    #
    # ## Configuration
    #
    # You can configure the maximum number of polling attempts, and the
    # delay (in seconds) between each polling attempt. The waiting condition is
    # set by passing a block to {#wait_until}:
    #
    #     # poll for ~25 seconds
    #     resource.wait_until(max_attempts:5,delay:5) {|resource|...}
    #
    # ## Callbacks
    #
    # You can be notified before each polling attempt and before each
    # delay. If you throw `:success` or `:failure` from these callbacks,
    # it will terminate the waiter.
    #
    #     started_at = Time.now
    #     # poll for 1 hour, instead of a number of attempts
    #     proc = Proc.new do |attempts, response|
    #       throw :failure if Time.now - started_at > 3600
    #     end
    #
    #       # disable max attempts
    #     instance.wait_until(before_wait:proc, max_attempts:nil) {...}
    #
    # ## Handling Errors
    #
    # When a waiter is successful, it returns the Resource. When a waiter
    # fails, it raises an error.
    #
    #     begin
    #       resource.wait_until(...)

    # @option options [String] :kms_key_id
    #   The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB
    #   cluster.
    #
    #   The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
    #   alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a
    #   different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias
    #   ARN.
    #
    #   When a KMS key isn't specified in `KmsKeyId`:
    #
    #   * If `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` identifies an encrypted source,
    #     then Amazon RDS uses the KMS key used to encrypt the source.
    #     Otherwise, Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key.
    #
    #   * If the `StorageEncrypted` parameter is enabled and
    #     `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` isn't specified, then Amazon RDS uses
    #     your default KMS key.
    #
    #   There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your
    #   Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each
    #   Amazon Web Services Region.
    #
    #   If you create a read replica of an encrypted DB cluster in another
    #   Amazon Web Services Region, make sure to set `KmsKeyId` to a KMS key
    #   identifier that is valid in the destination Amazon Web Services
    #   Region. This KMS key is used to encrypt the read replica in that
    #   Amazon Web Services Region.
    #
    #   Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
    # @option options [String] :pre_signed_url
    #   When you are replicating a DB cluster from one Amazon Web Services
    #   GovCloud (US) Region to another, an URL that contains a Signature
    #   Version 4 signed request for the `CreateDBCluster` operation to be
    #   called in the source Amazon Web Services Region where the DB cluster
    #   is replicated from. Specify `PreSignedUrl` only when you are
    #   performing cross-Region replication from an encrypted DB cluster.
    #
    #   The presigned URL must be a valid request for the `CreateDBCluster`
    #   API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region
    #   that contains the encrypted DB cluster to copy.
    #
    #   The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:
    #
    #   * `KmsKeyId` - The KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to
    #     encrypt the copy of the DB cluster in the destination Amazon Web
    #     Services Region. This should refer to the same KMS key for both the
    #     `CreateDBCluster` operation that is called in the destination Amazon
    #     Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned
    #     URL.
    #
    #   * `DestinationRegion` - The name of the Amazon Web Services Region
    #     that Aurora read replica will be created in.
    #
    #   * `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` - The DB cluster identifier for the
    #     encrypted DB cluster to be copied. This identifier must be in the
    #     Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services
    #     Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster from
    #     the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your
    #     `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` would look like Example:
    #     `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:aurora-cluster1`.
    #
    #   To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see [
    #   Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services
    #   Signature Version 4)][1] and [ Signature Version 4 Signing
    #   Process][2].
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can
    #   specify `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the CLI) instead of
    #   specifying `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion`
    #   autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the
    #   operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

    #     attached to it, the DB cluster is public.
    #
    #   If `DBSubnetGroupName` is specified, and `PubliclyAccessible` isn't
    #   specified, the following applies:
    #
    #   * If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet
    #     gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.
    #
    #   * If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway

    #
    #   Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
    # @option options [Boolean] :publicly_accessible
    #   Specifies whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible.
    #
    #   When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System
    #   (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
    #   cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP
    #   address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB
    #   cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That
    #   public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the
    #   DB cluster doesn't permit it.
    #
    #   When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
    #   cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.
    #
    #   Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether
    #   `DBSubnetGroupName` is specified.
    #
    #   If `DBSubnetGroupName` isn't specified, and `PubliclyAccessible`
    #   isn't specified, the following applies:
    #
    #   * If the default VPC in the target Region doesn’t have an internet
    #     gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.
    #
    #   * If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway
    #     attached to it, the DB cluster is public.
    #
    #   If `DBSubnetGroupName` is specified, and `PubliclyAccessible` isn't
    #   specified, the following applies:
    #
    #   * If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet
    #     gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.
    #
    #   * If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway
    #     attached to it, the DB cluster is public.
    #
    #   Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only
    # @option options [Integer] :iops
    #   The amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second) to
    #   be initially allocated for each DB instance in the Multi-AZ DB
    #   cluster.
    #
    #   For information about valid IOPS values, see [Amazon RDS Provisioned
    #   IOPS storage][1] in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
    #
    #   Constraints: Must be a multiple between .5 and 50 of the storage
    #   amount for the DB instance.

    # @option options [String] :network_type
    #   The network type of the DB cluster.
    #
    #   Valid Values:
    #
    #   * `IPV4`
    #
    #   * `DUAL`
    #
    #   The network type is determined by the `DBSubnetGroup` specified for
