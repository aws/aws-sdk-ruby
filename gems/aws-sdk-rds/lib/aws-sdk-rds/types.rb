    #
    #   If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from your Amazon Web
    #   Services account, you can specify a value for `KmsKeyId` to encrypt
    #   the copy with a new KMS key. If you don't specify a value for
    #   `KmsKeyId`, then the copy of the DB cluster snapshot is encrypted
    #   with the same KMS key as the source DB cluster snapshot.
    #
    #   If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot that is shared from
    #   another Amazon Web Services account, then you must specify a value
    #   for `KmsKeyId`.
    #
    #   To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot to another Amazon Web
    #   Services Region, you must set `KmsKeyId` to the Amazon Web Services
    #   KMS key identifier you want to use to encrypt the copy of the DB
    #   cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS
    #   keys are specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] pre_signed_url
    #   When you are copying a DB cluster snapshot from one Amazon Web
    #   Services GovCloud (US) Region to another, the URL that contains a
    #   Signature Version 4 signed request for the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot`
    #   API operation in the Amazon Web Services Region that contains the
    #   source DB cluster snapshot to copy. Use the `PreSignedUrl` parameter
    #   when copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon
    #   Web Services Region. Don't specify `PreSignedUrl` when copying an
    #   encrypted DB cluster snapshot in the same Amazon Web Services
    #   Region.
    #
    #   This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US)
    #   Regions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions.
    #
    #   The presigned URL must be a valid request for the
    #   `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` API operation that can run in the source
    #   Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster
    #   snapshot to copy. The presigned URL request must contain the
    #   following parameter values:
    #
    #   * `KmsKeyId` - The KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to
    #     encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination
    #     Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both
    #     the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` operation that is called in the
    #     destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation
    #     contained in the presigned URL.
    #
    #   * `DestinationRegion` - The name of the Amazon Web Services Region
    #     that the DB cluster snapshot is to be created in.
    #
    #   * `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The DB cluster snapshot
    #     identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied.
    #     This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format
    #     for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are
    #     copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon
    #     Web Services Region, then your `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier`
    #     looks like the following example:
    #     `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115`.

    #   When a KMS key isn't specified in `KmsKeyId`:
    #
    #   * If `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` identifies an encrypted source,
    #     then Amazon RDS uses the KMS key used to encrypt the source.
    #     Otherwise, Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] pre_signed_url
    #   When you are replicating a DB cluster from one Amazon Web Services

    #   Version 4 signed request for the `CreateDBCluster` operation to be
    #   called in the source Amazon Web Services Region where the DB cluster
    #   is replicated from. Specify `PreSignedUrl` only when you are
    #   performing cross-Region replication from an encrypted DB cluster.
    #
    #   The presigned URL must be a valid request for the `CreateDBCluster`
    #   API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region
    #   that contains the encrypted DB cluster to copy.
    #
    #   The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter
    #   values:
    #
    #   * `KmsKeyId` - The KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to
    #     encrypt the copy of the DB cluster in the destination Amazon Web
    #     Services Region. This should refer to the same KMS key for both
    #     the `CreateDBCluster` operation that is called in the destination
    #     Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the
    #     presigned URL.
    #
    #   * `DestinationRegion` - The name of the Amazon Web Services Region
    #     that Aurora read replica will be created in.
    #
    #   * `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` - The DB cluster identifier for the
    #     encrypted DB cluster to be copied. This identifier must be in the
    #     Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web
    #     Services Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB
    #     cluster from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your
    #     `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` would look like Example:
    #     `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:aurora-cluster1`.
    #
    #   To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see [
    #   Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services
    #   Signature Version 4)][1] and [ Signature Version 4 Signing
    #   Process][2].
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can
    #   specify `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the CLI) instead of
    #   specifying `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion`
    #   autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the
    #   operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

    # @!attribute [rw] multi_az
    #   Specifies whether the read replica is in a Multi-AZ deployment.
    #
    #   You can create a read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance. RDS creates
    #   a standby of your replica in another Availability Zone for failover

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] option_group_name
    #   The option group to associate the DB instance with. If not
    #   specified, RDS uses the option group associated with the source DB

    #   The name of the DB parameter group to associate with this DB
    #   instance.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for `DBParameterGroupName`, then
    #   Amazon RDS uses the `DBParameterGroup` of the source DB instance for
    #   a same Region read replica, or the default `DBParameterGroup` for
    #   the specified DB engine for a cross-Region read replica.
    #
    #   Specifying a parameter group for this operation is only supported
    #   for MySQL DB instances for cross-Region read replicas and for Oracle

    # @!attribute [rw] publicly_accessible
    #   Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.
    #
    #   When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System
    #   (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
    #   cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP
    #   address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB
    #   cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That
    #   public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the
    #   DB cluster doesn't permit it.
    #
    #   When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal

    #   @return [Array<Types::Tag>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] db_subnet_group_name
    #   A DB subnet group for the DB instance. The new DB instance is

    #   @return [Boolean]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] monitoring_interval
    #   The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring
    #   metrics are collected for the read replica. To disable collection of
    #   Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify `0`. The default is `0`.
    #
    #   If `MonitoringRoleArn` is specified, then you must set
    #   `MonitoringInterval` to a value other than `0`.
    #
    #   This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
    #

    #
    #   The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
    #   alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.
    #
    #   If you create an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web
    #   Services Region as the source DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster,
    #   don't specify a value for this parameter. A read replica in the
    #   same Amazon Web Services Region is always encrypted with the same
    #   KMS key as the source DB instance or cluster.
    #
    #   If you create an encrypted read replica in a different Amazon Web
    #   Services Region, then you must specify a KMS key identifier for the
    #   destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are specific to the
    #   Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in, and you can't
    #   use KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in another Amazon
    #   Web Services Region.
    #
    #   You can't create an encrypted read replica from an unencrypted DB
    #   instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster.
    #
    #   This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom, which uses the same KMS
    #   key as the primary replica.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] pre_signed_url
    #   When you are creating a read replica from one Amazon Web Services
    #   GovCloud (US) Region to another or from one China Amazon Web
    #   Services Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature
    #   Version 4 signed request for the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` API
    #   operation in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the
    #   source DB instance.
    #
    #   This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US)
    #   Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions. It's ignored in
    #   other Amazon Web Services Regions.
    #
    #   This setting applies only when replicating from a source DB
    #   *instance*. Source DB clusters aren't supported in Amazon Web
    #   Services GovCloud (US) Regions and China Amazon Web Services
    #   Regions.
    #
    #   You must specify this parameter when you create an encrypted read
    #   replica from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon
    #   RDS API. Don't specify `PreSignedUrl` when you are creating an
    #   encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region.
    #
    #   The presigned URL must be a valid request for the
    #   `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` API operation that can run in the
    #   source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted source
    #   DB instance. The presigned URL request must contain the following
    #   parameter values:
    #
    #   * `DestinationRegion` - The Amazon Web Services Region that the
    #     encrypted read replica is created in. This Amazon Web Services
    #     Region is the same one where the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica`
    #     operation is called that contains this presigned URL.
    #
    #     For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance in the
    #     us-west-1 Amazon Web Services Region, from a source DB instance in
    #     the us-east-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the
    #     `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` operation in the us-east-1 Amazon
    #     Web Services Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a
    #     call to the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` operation in the
    #     us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this example, the
    #     `DestinationRegion` in the presigned URL must be set to the
    #     us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.
    #
    #   * `KmsKeyId` - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt
    #     the read replica in the destination Amazon Web Services Region.
    #     This is the same identifier for both the
    #     `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` operation that is called in the
    #     destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation
    #     contained in the presigned URL.
    #
    #   * `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` - The DB instance identifier for the
    #     encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in
    #     the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web
    #     Services Region. For example, if you are creating an encrypted
    #     read replica from a DB instance in the us-west-2 Amazon Web
    #     Services Region, then your `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` looks like
    #     the following example:
    #     `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115`.
    #
    #   To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see
    #   [Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web
    #   Services Signature Version 4)][1] and [Signature Version 4 Signing
    #   Process][2].
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can
    #   specify `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the CLI) instead of
    #   specifying `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion`
    #   autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the
    #   operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.
    #
    #    `SourceRegion` isn't supported for SQL Server, because Amazon RDS
    #   for SQL Server doesn't support cross-Region read replicas.

    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> This parameter is only supported for Oracle DB instances.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Database Enterprise
    #   Edition. The main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region
    #   disaster recovery. The primary database doesn't use Active Data
    #   Guard to transmit information to the mounted replica. Because it
    #   doesn't accept user connections, a mounted replica can't serve a
    #   read-only workload.
    #
    #   You can create a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas
    #   for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see [Working
    #   with Oracle Read Replicas for Amazon RDS][1] in the *Amazon RDS User
    #   Guide*.
    #
    #   For RDS Custom, you must specify this parameter and set it to
    #   `mounted`. The value won't be set by default. After replica
    #   creation, you can manage the open mode manually.
