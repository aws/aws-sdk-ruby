    # @deprecated Use [Aws::RDS::Client] #wait_until instead
    #
    # Waiter polls an API operation until a resource enters a desired
    # state.
    #
    # @note The waiting operation is performed on a copy. The original resource
    #   remains unchanged.
    #
    # ## Basic Usage
    #
    # Waiter will polls until it is successful, it fails by
    # entering a terminal state, or until a maximum number of attempts
    # are made.
    #
    #     # polls in a loop until condition is true
    #     resource.wait_until(options) {|resource| condition}
    #
    # ## Example
    #
    #     instance.wait_until(max_attempts:10, delay:5) do |instance|
    #       instance.state.name == 'running'
    #     end
    #
    # ## Configuration
    #
    # You can configure the maximum number of polling attempts, and the
    # delay (in seconds) between each polling attempt. The waiting condition is
    # set by passing a block to {#wait_until}:
    #
    #     # poll for ~25 seconds
    #     resource.wait_until(max_attempts:5,delay:5) {|resource|...}
    #
    # ## Callbacks
    #
    # You can be notified before each polling attempt and before each
    # delay. If you throw `:success` or `:failure` from these callbacks,
    # it will terminate the waiter.
    #
    #     started_at = Time.now
    #     # poll for 1 hour, instead of a number of attempts
    #     proc = Proc.new do |attempts, response|
    #       throw :failure if Time.now - started_at > 3600
    #     end
    #
    #       # disable max attempts
    #     instance.wait_until(before_wait:proc, max_attempts:nil) {...}
    #
    # ## Handling Errors
    #
    # When a waiter is successful, it returns the Resource. When a waiter
    # fails, it raises an error.
    #
    #     begin
    #       resource.wait_until(...)

    # @option options [String] :kms_key_id
    #   The AWS KMS key ID for an encrypted read replica. The KMS key ID is
    #   the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KMS key identifier, or the KMS key
    #   alias for the KMS encryption key.
    #
    #   If you create an encrypted read replica in the same AWS Region as the
    #   source DB instance, then you do not have to specify a value for this
    #   parameter. The read replica is encrypted with the same KMS key as the
    #   source DB instance.
    #
    #   If you create an encrypted read replica in a different AWS Region,
    #   then you must specify a KMS key for the destination AWS Region. KMS
    #   encryption keys are specific to the AWS Region that they are created
    #   in, and you can't use encryption keys from one AWS Region in another
    #   AWS Region.
    #

    # @option options [String] :pre_signed_url
    #   The URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the
    #   `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` API action in the source AWS Region that
    #   contains the source DB instance.
    #
    #   You must specify this parameter when you create an encrypted read
    #   replica from another AWS Region by using the Amazon RDS API. Don't
    #   specify `PreSignedUrl` when you are creating an encrypted read replica
    #   in the same AWS Region.
    #
    #   The presigned URL must be a valid request for the
    #   `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` API action that can be executed in the
    #   source AWS Region that contains the encrypted source DB instance. The
    #   presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:
    #
    #   * `DestinationRegion` - The AWS Region that the encrypted read replica
    #     is created in. This AWS Region is the same one where the
    #     `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` action is called that contains this
    #     presigned URL.
    #
    #     For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance in the us-west-1
    #     AWS Region, from a source DB instance in the us-east-2 AWS Region,
    #     then you call the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` action in the
    #     us-east-1 AWS Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a
    #     call to the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` action in the us-west-2
    #     AWS Region. For this example, the `DestinationRegion` in the
    #     presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 AWS Region.
    #
    #   * `KmsKeyId` - The AWS KMS key identifier for the key to use to
    #     encrypt the read replica in the destination AWS Region. This is the
    #     same identifier for both the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` action
    #     that is called in the destination AWS Region, and the action
    #     contained in the presigned URL.
    #
    #   * `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` - The DB instance identifier for the
    #     encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in
    #     the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source AWS Region. For
    #     example, if you are creating an encrypted read replica from a DB
    #     instance in the us-west-2 AWS Region, then your
    #     `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` looks like the following example:
    #     `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115`.

    #   Version 4)][1] and [Signature Version 4 Signing Process][2].
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you are using an AWS SDK tool or the AWS CLI, you can specify
    #   `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the AWS CLI) instead of
    #   specifying `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion`
    #   autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the
    #   operation that can be executed in the source AWS Region.
    #
    #    `SourceRegion` isn't supported for SQL Server, because SQL Server on
    #   Amazon RDS doesn't support cross-region read replicas.

    #   version than the DB instance's current version.
    # @option options [Boolean] :auto_minor_version_upgrade
    #   A value that indicates whether minor version upgrades are applied
    #   automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance window.
    #   Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage except in the
    #   following case and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as
    #   possible. An outage results if this parameter is enabled during the
    #   maintenance window, and a newer minor version is available, and RDS
    #   has enabled auto patching for that engine version.
    # @option options [String] :license_model
    #   The license model for the DB instance.
    #
    #   Valid values: `license-included` \| `bring-your-own-license` \|
    #   `general-public-license`
    # @option options [Integer] :iops
    #   The new Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value for the RDS
    #   instance.
    #
    #   Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is
    #   applied during the next maintenance window unless the
    #   `ApplyImmediately` parameter is enabled for this request. If you are
    #   migrating from Provisioned IOPS to standard storage, set this value to
    #   0. The DB instance will require a reboot for the change in storage
    #   type to take effect.
    #
    #   If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage
    #   to using Provisioned IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS to using
    #   standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the
    #   migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage
    #   size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS
    #   provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage
    #   operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the
    #   process can take up to several days in some cases. During the
    #   migration, the DB instance is available for use, but might experience
    #   performance degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly
    #   backups for the instance are suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations
    #   can take place for the instance, including modifying the instance,
    #   rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a read replica
    #   for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.
    #
    #   Constraints: For MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL, the value
    #   supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values
    #   that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded
    #   up so that they are 10% greater than the current value.
    #
    #   Default: Uses existing setting
    # @option options [String] :option_group_name
    #   Indicates that the DB instance should be associated with the specified
    #   option group. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage
    #   except in the following case and the change is applied during the next
    #   maintenance window unless the `ApplyImmediately` parameter is enabled
    #   for this request. If the parameter change results in an option group
    #   that enables OEM, this change can cause a brief (sub-second) period
    #   during which new connections are rejected but existing connections are
    #   not interrupted.
    #
    #   Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security
    #   TDE, can't be removed from an option group, and that option group
    #   can't be removed from a DB instance once it is associated with a DB
    #   instance
    # @option options [String] :new_db_instance_identifier
    #   The new DB instance identifier for the DB instance when renaming a DB
    #   instance. When you change the DB instance identifier, an instance
    #   reboot occurs immediately if you enable `ApplyImmediately`, or will
    #   occur during the next maintenance window if you disable Apply
    #   Immediately. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

    #   Example: `mydbinstance`
    # @option options [String] :storage_type
    #   Specifies the storage type to be associated with the DB instance.
    #
    #   If you specify Provisioned IOPS (`io1`), you must also include a value
    #   for the `Iops` parameter.
    #
    #   If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage

    #   the DB cluster setting. For more information, see `ModifyDBCluster`.
    # @option options [Integer] :monitoring_interval
    #   The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring
    #   metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collecting
    #   Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0.
    #
    #   If `MonitoringRoleArn` is specified, then you must also set

    #   * `automated` - Return all DB snapshots that have been automatically
    #     taken by Amazon RDS for my AWS account.
    #
    #   * `manual` - Return all DB snapshots that have been taken by my AWS
    #     account.
    #
    #   * `shared` - Return all manual DB snapshots that have been shared to
    #     my AWS account.
    #
    #   * `public` - Return all DB snapshots that have been marked as public.
    #
    #   * `awsbackup` - Return the DB snapshots managed by the AWS Backup
    #     service.
    #
    #     For information about AWS Backup, see the [ *AWS Backup Developer
    #     Guide.* ][1]
    #
    #     The `awsbackup` type does not apply to Aurora.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a `SnapshotType` value, then both automated and
    #   manual snapshots are returned. Shared and public DB snapshots are not
    #   included in the returned results by default. You can include shared
    #   snapshots with these results by enabling the `IncludeShared`
    #   parameter. You can include public snapshots with these results by
    #   enabling the `IncludePublic` parameter.
    #
    #   The `IncludeShared` and `IncludePublic` parameters don't apply for
    #   `SnapshotType` values of `manual` or `automated`. The `IncludePublic`
    #   parameter doesn't apply when `SnapshotType` is set to `shared`. The
    #   `IncludeShared` parameter doesn't apply when `SnapshotType` is set to
    #   `public`.

    # @option options [Array<Types::Filter>] :filters
    #   A filter that specifies one or more DB snapshots to describe.
    #
    #   Supported filters:
    #
    #   * `db-instance-id` - Accepts DB instance identifiers and DB instance
    #     Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).
    #
    #   * `db-snapshot-id` - Accepts DB snapshot identifiers.
    #
    #   * `dbi-resource-id` - Accepts identifiers of source DB instances.
    #
    #   * `snapshot-type` - Accepts types of DB snapshots.
    #
    #   * `engine` - Accepts names of database engines.
    # @option options [Boolean] :include_shared
    #   A value that indicates whether to include shared manual DB cluster
    #   snapshots from other AWS accounts that this AWS account has been given
    #   permission to copy or restore. By default, these snapshots are not
    #   included.
    #
    #   You can give an AWS account permission to restore a manual DB snapshot
    #   from another AWS account by using the `ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute` API
    #   action.
    # @option options [Boolean] :include_public
    #   A value that indicates whether to include manual DB cluster snapshots
    #   that are public and can be copied or restored by any AWS account. By
    #   default, the public snapshots are not included.
    #
    #   You can share a manual DB snapshot as public by using the
    #   ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute API.
    # @option options [String] :dbi_resource_id
    #   A specific DB resource ID to describe.
