    # @deprecated Use [Aws::RDS::Client] #wait_until instead

    # Waiter polls an API operation until a resource enters a desired
    # state.
    #
    # @note The waiting operation is performed on a copy. The original resource
    #   remains unchanged.
    #
    # ## Basic Usage
    #
    # Waiter will polls until it is successful, it fails by
    # entering a terminal state, or until a maximum number of attempts
    # are made.
    #
    #     # polls in a loop until condition is true
    #     resource.wait_until(options) {|resource| condition}
    #
    # ## Example
    #
    #     instance.wait_until(max_attempts:10, delay:5) do |instance|
    #       instance.state.name == 'running'
    #     end
    #
    # ## Configuration
    #
    # You can configure the maximum number of polling attempts, and the
    # delay (in seconds) between each polling attempt. The waiting condition is
    # set by passing a block to {#wait_until}:
    #
    #     # poll for ~25 seconds
    #     resource.wait_until(max_attempts:5,delay:5) {|resource|...}
    #
    # ## Callbacks
    #
    # You can be notified before each polling attempt and before each
    # delay. If you throw `:success` or `:failure` from these callbacks,
    # it will terminate the waiter.
    #
    #     started_at = Time.now
    #     # poll for 1 hour, instead of a number of attempts
    #     proc = Proc.new do |attempts, response|
    #       throw :failure if Time.now - started_at > 3600
    #     end
    #
    #       # disable max attempts
    #     instance.wait_until(before_wait:proc, max_attempts:nil) {...}
    #
    # ## Handling Errors
    #
    # When a waiter is successful, it returns the Resource. When a waiter
    # fails, it raises an error.
    #
    #     begin
    #       resource.wait_until(...)

    #
    #   When the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System
    #   (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
    #   instance's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP

    #   If `DBSubnetGroupName` is specified, and `PubliclyAccessible` isn't
    #   specified, the following applies:
    #
    #   * If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet
    #     gateway attached to it, the DB instance is private.
    #
    #   * If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway
    #     attached to it, the DB instance is public.
    # @option options [Array<Types::Tag>] :tags

    #
    #   If `StorageEncrypted` is enabled, and you do not specify a value for
    #   the `KmsKeyId` parameter, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key.
    #   There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your
    #   Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each
    #   Amazon Web Services Region.
    #
    #   For Amazon RDS Custom, a KMS key is required for DB instances. For
    #   most RDS engines, if you leave this parameter empty while enabling
    #   `StorageEncrypted`, the engine uses the default KMS key. However, RDS
    #   Custom doesn't use the default key when this parameter is empty. You
    #   must explicitly specify a key.
    # @option options [String] :domain
    #   The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB instance in.
    #   Currently, you can create only Db2, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server,

    # @option options [Boolean] :publicly_accessible
    #   Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.
    #
    #   When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System
    #   (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
    #   cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP
    #   address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB
    #   cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That
    #   public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the
    #   DB cluster doesn't permit it.
    #
    #   When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
    #   instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

    # @option options [String] :db_subnet_group_name
    #   A DB subnet group for the DB instance. The new DB instance is created
    #   in the VPC associated with the DB subnet group. If no DB subnet group

    #
    #   Valid Values: `gp2 | gp3 | io1 | standard`
    #
    #   Default: `io1` if the `Iops` parameter is specified. Otherwise, `gp2`.
    # @option options [Boolean] :copy_tags_to_snapshot
    #   Specifies whether to copy all tags from the read replica to snapshots
    #   of the read replica. By default, tags aren't copied.
    # @option options [Integer] :monitoring_interval
    #   The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring
    #   metrics are collected for the read replica. To disable collection of
    #   Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify `0`. The default is `0`.
    #
    #   If `MonitoringRoleArn` is specified, then you must set
    #   `MonitoringInterval` to a value other than `0`.
    #
    #   This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
    #
    #   Valid Values: `0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60`
    #
    #   Default: `0`
    # @option options [String] :monitoring_role_arn
    #   The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring
    #   metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For example,
    #   `arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess`. For information on creating
    #   a monitoring role, go to [To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS
    #   Enhanced Monitoring][1] in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
    #
    #   If `MonitoringInterval` is set to a value other than 0, then you must

    # @option options [String] :kms_key_id
    #   The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted read
    #   replica.
    #
    #   The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
    #   alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.
    #
    #   If you create an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web
    #   Services Region as the source DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster,
    #   don't specify a value for this parameter. A read replica in the same
    #   Amazon Web Services Region is always encrypted with the same KMS key
    #   as the source DB instance or cluster.
    #
    #   If you create an encrypted read replica in a different Amazon Web
    #   Services Region, then you must specify a KMS key identifier for the
    #   destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are specific to the
    #   Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in, and you can't
    #   use KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in another Amazon Web
    #   Services Region.
    #
    #   You can't create an encrypted read replica from an unencrypted DB
    #   instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster.
    #
    #   This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom, which uses the same KMS key
    #   as the primary replica.
    # @option options [String] :pre_signed_url
    #   When you are creating a read replica from one Amazon Web Services
    #   GovCloud (US) Region to another or from one China Amazon Web Services
    #   Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed
    #   request for the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` API operation in the
    #   source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source DB
    #   instance.
    #
    #   This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions
    #   and China Amazon Web Services Regions. It's ignored in other Amazon
    #   Web Services Regions.
    #
    #   This setting applies only when replicating from a source DB
    #   *instance*. Source DB clusters aren't supported in Amazon Web
    #   Services GovCloud (US) Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions.
    #
    #   You must specify this parameter when you create an encrypted read
    #   replica from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon
    #   RDS API. Don't specify `PreSignedUrl` when you are creating an
    #   encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region.
    #
    #   The presigned URL must be a valid request for the
    #   `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` API operation that can run in the source
    #   Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted source DB
    #   instance. The presigned URL request must contain the following
    #   parameter values:
    #
    #   * `DestinationRegion` - The Amazon Web Services Region that the
    #     encrypted read replica is created in. This Amazon Web Services
    #     Region is the same one where the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica`
    #     operation is called that contains this presigned URL.
    #
    #     For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance in the us-west-1
    #     Amazon Web Services Region, from a source DB instance in the
    #     us-east-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the
    #     `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web
    #     Services Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to
    #     the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` operation in the us-west-2 Amazon
    #     Web Services Region. For this example, the `DestinationRegion` in
    #     the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services
    #     Region.
    #
    #   * `KmsKeyId` - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt
    #     the read replica in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This
    #     is the same identifier for both the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica`
    #     operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services
    #     Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.
    #
    #   * `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` - The DB instance identifier for the
    #     encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in
    #     the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web
    #     Services Region. For example, if you are creating an encrypted read
    #     replica from a DB instance in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services
    #     Region, then your `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` looks like the
    #     following example:
    #     `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115`.
    #
    #   To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see
    #   [Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services
    #   Signature Version 4)][1] and [Signature Version 4 Signing Process][2].
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can
    #   specify `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the CLI) instead of
    #   specifying `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion`
    #   autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the
    #   operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.
    #
    #    `SourceRegion` isn't supported for SQL Server, because Amazon RDS for
    #   SQL Server doesn't support cross-Region read replicas.

    #   Manager.
    #
    #   This setting is valid only if both of the following conditions are
    #   met:
    #
    #   * The DB instance doesn't manage the master user password in Amazon
    #     Web Services Secrets Manager.
    #
    #     If the DB instance already manages the master user password in
    #     Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, you can't change the KMS key
    #     used to encrypt the secret.
    #
    #   * You are turning on `ManageMasterUserPassword` to manage the master
    #     user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.
    #
    #     If you are turning on `ManageMasterUserPassword` and don't specify
    #     `MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId`, then the `aws/secretsmanager` KMS key is
    #     used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon
    #     Web Services account, then you can't use the `aws/secretsmanager`
    #     KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed
    #     KMS key.
    #
    #   The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
    #   alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a
    #   different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias
    #   ARN.
    #

    #   Amazon Web Services Region.
    # @option options [String] :engine
    #   The target Oracle DB engine when you convert a non-CDB to a CDB. This
    #   intermediate step is necessary to upgrade an Oracle Database 19c
    #   non-CDB to an Oracle Database 21c CDB.
    #
    #   Note the following requirements:
    #
    #   * Make sure that you specify `oracle-ee-cdb` or `oracle-se2-cdb`.
    #
    #   * Make sure that your DB engine runs Oracle Database 19c with an April
    #     2021 or later RU.
    #
    #   Note the following limitations:
    #
    #   * You can't convert a CDB to a non-CDB.
    #
    #   * You can't convert a replica database.
    #
    #   * You can't convert a non-CDB to a CDB and upgrade the engine version
    #     in the same command.
    #
    #   * You can't convert the existing custom parameter or option group
    #     when it has options or parameters that are permanent or persistent.
    #     In this situation, the DB instance reverts to the default option and
    #     parameter group. To avoid reverting to the default, specify a new
    #     parameter group with `--db-parameter-group-name` and a new option
    #     group with `--option-group-name`.
    # @option options [Boolean] :dedicated_log_volume
    #   Indicates whether the DB instance has a dedicated log volume (DLV)
    #   enabled.
    # @option options [Boolean] :multi_tenant
    #   Specifies whether the to convert your DB instance from the
    #   single-tenant conﬁguration to the multi-tenant conﬁguration. This
    #   parameter is supported only for RDS for Oracle CDB instances.
    #
    #   During the conversion, RDS creates an initial tenant database and
    #   associates the DB name, master user name, character set, and national
    #   character set metadata with this database. The tags associated with
    #   the instance also propagate to the initial tenant database. You can
    #   add more tenant databases to your DB instance by using the
    #   `CreateTenantDatabase` operation.
    #
    #   The conversion to the multi-tenant configuration is permanent and
    #   irreversible, so you can't later convert back to the single-tenant
    #   configuration. When you specify this parameter, you must also specify
    #   `ApplyImmediately`.

    # @option options [String] :db_snapshot_identifier
    #   A specific DB snapshot identifier to describe. This value is stored as
    #   a lowercase string.
    #
    #   Constraints:
    #
    #   * If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBSnapshot.
    #
    #   * If this identifier is for an automated snapshot, the `SnapshotType`
    #     parameter must also be specified.
    # @option options [String] :snapshot_type
    #   The type of snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of the
    #   following values:
    #
    #   * `automated` - Return all DB snapshots that have been automatically
    #     taken by Amazon RDS for my Amazon Web Services account.
    #
    #   * `manual` - Return all DB snapshots that have been taken by my Amazon
    #     Web Services account.
    #
    #   * `shared` - Return all manual DB snapshots that have been shared to
    #     my Amazon Web Services account.
    #
    #   * `public` - Return all DB snapshots that have been marked as public.
    #
    #   * `awsbackup` - Return the DB snapshots managed by the Amazon Web
    #     Services Backup service.
    #
    #     For information about Amazon Web Services Backup, see the [ *Amazon
    #     Web Services Backup Developer Guide.* ][1]
    #
    #     The `awsbackup` type does not apply to Aurora.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a `SnapshotType` value, then both automated and
    #   manual snapshots are returned. Shared and public DB snapshots are not
    #   included in the returned results by default. You can include shared
    #   snapshots with these results by enabling the `IncludeShared`
    #   parameter. You can include public snapshots with these results by
    #   enabling the `IncludePublic` parameter.
    #
    #   The `IncludeShared` and `IncludePublic` parameters don't apply for
    #   `SnapshotType` values of `manual` or `automated`. The `IncludePublic`
    #   parameter doesn't apply when `SnapshotType` is set to `shared`. The
    #   `IncludeShared` parameter doesn't apply when `SnapshotType` is set to
    #   `public`.

    # @option options [Array<Types::Filter>] :filters
    #   A filter that specifies one or more DB snapshots to describe.
    #
    #   Supported filters:
    #
    #   * `db-instance-id` - Accepts DB instance identifiers and DB instance
    #     Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).
    #
    #   * `db-snapshot-id` - Accepts DB snapshot identifiers.
    #
    #   * `dbi-resource-id` - Accepts identifiers of source DB instances.
    #
    #   * `snapshot-type` - Accepts types of DB snapshots.
    #
    #   * `engine` - Accepts names of database engines.
    # @option options [Boolean] :include_shared
    #   Specifies whether to include shared manual DB cluster snapshots from
    #   other Amazon Web Services accounts that this Amazon Web Services
    #   account has been given permission to copy or restore. By default,
    #   these snapshots are not included.
    #
    #   You can give an Amazon Web Services account permission to restore a
    #   manual DB snapshot from another Amazon Web Services account by using
    #   the `ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute` API action.
    #
    #   This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
    # @option options [Boolean] :include_public
    #   Specifies whether to include manual DB cluster snapshots that are
    #   public and can be copied or restored by any Amazon Web Services
    #   account. By default, the public snapshots are not included.
    #
    #   You can share a manual DB snapshot as public by using the
    #   ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute API.
    #
    #   This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
