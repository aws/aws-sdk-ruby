    # include the following:
    #
    # * `ConfirmationWasAuthenticated` – `true` if the subscription
    #   confirmation request was authenticated.
    #
    # * `DeliveryPolicy` – The JSON serialization of the subscription's
    #   delivery policy.
    #
    # * `EffectiveDeliveryPolicy` – The JSON serialization of the effective
    #   delivery policy that takes into account the topic delivery policy
    #   and account system defaults.
    #
    # * `FilterPolicy` – The filter policy JSON that is assigned to the
    #   subscription. For more information, see [Amazon SNS Message
    #   Filtering][1] in the *Amazon SNS Developer Guide*.
    #
    # * `Owner` – The account ID of the subscription's owner.
    #
    # * `PendingConfirmation` – `true` if the subscription hasn't been
    #   confirmed. To confirm a pending subscription, call the
    #   `ConfirmSubscription` action with a confirmation token.
    #
    # * `RawMessageDelivery` – `true` if raw message delivery is enabled for
    #   the subscription. Raw messages are free of JSON formatting and can
    #   be sent to HTTP/S and Amazon SQS endpoints.
    #
    # * `RedrivePolicy` – When specified, sends undeliverable messages to
    #   the specified Amazon SQS dead-letter queue. Messages that can't be
    #   delivered due to client errors (for example, when the subscribed
    #   endpoint is unreachable) or server errors (for example, when the
    #   service that powers the subscribed endpoint becomes unavailable) are
    #   held in the dead-letter queue for further analysis or reprocessing.
    #
    # * `SubscriptionArn` – The subscription's ARN.
    #
    # * `TopicArn` – The topic ARN that the subscription is associated with.
    #
    # The following attribute applies only to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
    # delivery stream subscriptions:
    #
    # * `SubscriptionRoleArn` – The ARN of the IAM role that has the
    #   following:
    #
    #   * Permission to write to the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream
    #
    #   * Amazon SNS listed as a trusted entity
    #
    #   Specifying a valid ARN for this attribute is required for Kinesis
    #   Data Firehose delivery stream subscriptions. For more information,

    #   The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special
    #   request parameters that this action uses:
    #
    #   * `DeliveryPolicy` – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries
    #     failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.
    #
    #   * `FilterPolicy` – The simple JSON object that lets your subscriber
    #     receive only a subset of messages, rather than receiving every
    #     message published to the topic.
    #
    #   * `RawMessageDelivery` – When set to `true`, enables raw message
    #     delivery to Amazon SQS or HTTP/S endpoints. This eliminates the need
    #     for the endpoints to process JSON formatting, which is otherwise
    #     created for Amazon SNS metadata.
    #
    #   * `RedrivePolicy` – When specified, sends undeliverable messages to
    #     the specified Amazon SQS dead-letter queue. Messages that can't be
    #     delivered due to client errors (for example, when the subscribed
    #     endpoint is unreachable) or server errors (for example, when the
