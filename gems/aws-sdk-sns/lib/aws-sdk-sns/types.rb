    #   special request parameters that the `CreateTopic` action uses:
    #
    #   * `DeliveryPolicy` – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries
    #     failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.
    #
    #   * `DisplayName` – The display name to use for a topic with SMS
    #     subscriptions.
    #
    #   * `FifoTopic` – Set to true to create a FIFO topic.
    #
    #   * `Policy` – The policy that defines who can access your topic. By
    #     default, only the topic owner can publish or subscribe to the
    #     topic.
    #
    #   The following attribute applies only to [server-side
    #   encryption][1]\:
    #
    #   * `KmsMasterKeyId` – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed
    #     customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more
    #     information, see [Key Terms][2]. For more examples, see [KeyId][3]
    #     in the *Key Management Service API Reference*.
    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   The following attributes apply only to [FIFO topics][4]\:
    #
    #   * `FifoTopic` – When this is set to `true`, a FIFO topic is created.
    #
    #   * `ContentBasedDeduplication` – Enables content-based deduplication
    #     for FIFO topics.
    #
    #     * By default, `ContentBasedDeduplication` is set to `false`. If
    #       you create a FIFO topic and this attribute is `false`, you must
    #       specify a value for the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for
    #       the [Publish][5] action.
    #
    #     * When you set `ContentBasedDeduplication` to `true`, Amazon SNS
    #       uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId`
    #       using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the
    #       message).
    #
    #       (Optional) To override the generated value, you can specify a
    #       value for the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for the
    #       `Publish` action.

    #
    #   * `RawMessageDelivery` – `true` if raw message delivery is enabled
    #     for the subscription. Raw messages are free of JSON formatting and
    #     can be sent to HTTP/S and Amazon SQS endpoints.
    #
    #   * `RedrivePolicy` – When specified, sends undeliverable messages to
    #     the specified Amazon SQS dead-letter queue. Messages that can't
    #     be delivered due to client errors (for example, when the
    #     subscribed endpoint is unreachable) or server errors (for example,
    #     when the service that powers the subscribed endpoint becomes

    #       specify a value for the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for
    #       the [Publish][5] action.
    #
    #     * When you set `ContentBasedDeduplication` to `true`, Amazon SNS
    #       uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId`
    #       using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the
    #       message).
    #
    #       (Optional) To override the generated value, you can specify a

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] message
    #   The message you want to send.
    #
    #   If you are publishing to a topic and you want to send the same
    #   message to all transport protocols, include the text of the message
    #   as a String value. If you want to send different messages for each
    #   transport protocol, set the value of the `MessageStructure`
    #   parameter to `json` and use a JSON object for the `Message`
    #   parameter.
    #
    #
    #
    #   Constraints:
    #
    #   * With the exception of SMS, messages must be UTF-8 encoded strings
    #     and at most 256 KB in size (262,144 bytes, not 262,144
    #     characters).
    #
    #   * For SMS, each message can contain up to 140 characters. This
    #     character limit depends on the encoding schema. For example, an
    #     SMS message can contain 160 GSM characters, 140 ASCII characters,
    #     or 70 UCS-2 characters.
    #
    #     If you publish a message that exceeds this size limit, Amazon SNS
    #     sends the message as multiple messages, each fitting within the
    #     size limit. Messages aren't truncated mid-word but are cut off at
    #     whole-word boundaries.
    #
    #     The total size limit for a single SMS `Publish` action is 1,600
    #     characters.
    #
    #   JSON-specific constraints:
    #
    #   * Keys in the JSON object that correspond to supported transport
    #     protocols must have simple JSON string values.
    #
    #   * The values will be parsed (unescaped) before they are used in
    #     outgoing messages.
    #
    #   * Outbound notifications are JSON encoded (meaning that the
    #     characters will be reescaped for sending).
    #
    #   * Values have a minimum length of 0 (the empty string, "", is
    #     allowed).
    #
    #   * Values have a maximum length bounded by the overall message size
    #     (so, including multiple protocols may limit message sizes).
    #
    #   * Non-string values will cause the key to be ignored.
    #
    #   * Keys that do not correspond to supported transport protocols are
    #     ignored.
    #
    #   * Duplicate keys are not allowed.
    #
    #   * Failure to parse or validate any key or value in the message will

    #   other endpoints.
    #
    #   Constraints: Subjects must be ASCII text that begins with a letter,

    #   characters; and must be less than 100 characters long.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] message_structure
    #   Set `MessageStructure` to `json` if you want to send a different

    #   * be a syntactically valid JSON object; and
    #
    #   * contain at least a top-level JSON key of "default" with a value
    #     that is a string.
    #
    #   You can define other top-level keys that define the message you want
    #   to send to a specific transport protocol (e.g., "http").
    #
    #   Valid value: `json`
    #   @return [String]

    #   a token used for deduplication of sent messages. If a message with a
    #   particular `MessageDeduplicationId` is sent successfully, any
    #   message sent with the same `MessageDeduplicationId` during the
    #   5-minute deduplication interval is treated as a duplicate.
    #
    #   If the topic has `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, the system
    #   generates a `MessageDeduplicationId` based on the contents of the
    #   message. Your `MessageDeduplicationId` overrides the generated one.

    #   A-Z, 0-9) and punctuation `` (!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`\{|\}~)
    #   ``.
    #
    #   The `MessageGroupId` is a tag that specifies that a message belongs
    #   to a specific message group. Messages that belong to the same
    #   message group are processed in a FIFO manner (however, messages in

    # @!attribute [rw] attributes
    #   The default settings for sending SMS messages from your account. You
    #   can set values for the following attribute names:
    #
    #   `MonthlySpendLimit` – The maximum amount in USD that you are willing
    #   to spend each month to send SMS messages. When Amazon SNS determines
    #   that sending an SMS message would incur a cost that exceeds this
    #   limit, it stops sending SMS messages within minutes.
    #
    #   Amazon SNS stops sending SMS messages within minutes of the limit
    #   being crossed. During that interval, if you continue to send SMS
    #   messages, you will incur costs that exceed your limit.
    #
    #   By default, the spend limit is set to the maximum allowed by Amazon
    #   SNS. If you want to raise the limit, submit an [SNS Limit Increase
    #   case][1]. For **New limit value**, enter your desired monthly spend
    #   limit. In the **Use Case Description** field, explain that you are
    #   requesting an SMS monthly spend limit increase.
    #
    #   `DeliveryStatusIAMRole` – The ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon
    #   SNS to write logs about SMS deliveries in CloudWatch Logs. For each
    #   SMS message that you send, Amazon SNS writes a log that includes the
    #   message price, the success or failure status, the reason for failure
    #   (if the message failed), the message dwell time, and other
    #   information.
    #
    #   `DeliveryStatusSuccessSamplingRate` – The percentage of successful
    #   SMS deliveries for which Amazon SNS will write logs in CloudWatch
    #   Logs. The value can be an integer from 0 - 100. For example, to
    #   write logs only for failed deliveries, set this value to `0`. To
    #   write logs for 10% of your successful deliveries, set it to `10`.
    #
    #   `DefaultSenderID` – A string, such as your business brand, that is
    #   displayed as the sender on the receiving device. Support for sender
    #   IDs varies by country. The sender ID can be 1 - 11 alphanumeric
    #   characters, and it must contain at least one letter.
    #
    #   `DefaultSMSType` – The type of SMS message that you will send by
    #   default. You can assign the following values:
    #
    #   * `Promotional` – (Default) Noncritical messages, such as marketing
    #     messages. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to incur the
    #     lowest cost.
    #
    #   * `Transactional` – Critical messages that support customer
    #     transactions, such as one-time passcodes for multi-factor
    #     authentication. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to
    #     achieve the highest reliability.
    #
    #   `UsageReportS3Bucket` – The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to receive
    #   daily SMS usage reports from Amazon SNS. Each day, Amazon SNS will
    #   deliver a usage report as a CSV file to the bucket. The report
    #   includes the following information for each SMS message that was
    #   successfully delivered by your account:
    #
    #   * Time that the message was published (in UTC)
    #
    #   * Message ID
    #
    #   * Destination phone number
    #
    #   * Message type
    #
    #   * Delivery status
    #
    #   * Message price (in USD)
    #
    #   * Part number (a message is split into multiple parts if it is too
    #     long for a single message)
    #
    #   * Total number of parts
    #
    #   To receive the report, the bucket must have a policy that allows the
    #   Amazon SNS service principal to perform the `s3:PutObject` and
    #   `s3:GetBucketLocation` actions.
    #
    #   For an example bucket policy and usage report, see [Monitoring SMS

    #     receive only a subset of messages, rather than receiving every
    #     message published to the topic.
    #
    #   * `RawMessageDelivery` – When set to `true`, enables raw message
    #     delivery to Amazon SQS or HTTP/S endpoints. This eliminates the
    #     need for the endpoints to process JSON formatting, which is
    #     otherwise created for Amazon SNS metadata.
    #
    #   * `RedrivePolicy` – When specified, sends undeliverable messages to
    #     the specified Amazon SQS dead-letter queue. Messages that can't
    #     be delivered due to client errors (for example, when the
    #     subscribed endpoint is unreachable) or server errors (for example,
    #     when the service that powers the subscribed endpoint becomes

    #     topic.
    #
    #   The following attribute applies only to
    #   [server-side-encryption][1]\:
    #
    #   * `KmsMasterKeyId` – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed

    #
    #   ^
    #
    #   The following attribute applies only to [FIFO topics][4]\:
    #
    #   * `ContentBasedDeduplication` – Enables content-based deduplication
    #     for FIFO topics.
    #
    #     * By default, `ContentBasedDeduplication` is set to `false`. If
    #       you create a FIFO topic and this attribute is `false`, you must
    #       specify a value for the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for
    #       the [Publish][5] action.
    #
    #     * When you set `ContentBasedDeduplication` to `true`, Amazon SNS
    #       uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId`
    #       using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the
    #       message).
    #
    #       (Optional) To override the generated value, you can specify a

    # @!attribute [rw] attributes
    #   A map of attributes with their corresponding values.
    #
    #   The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the
    #   special request parameters that the `Subscribe` action uses:
    #
    #   * `DeliveryPolicy` – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries
    #     failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.
    #
    #   * `FilterPolicy` – The simple JSON object that lets your subscriber
    #     receive only a subset of messages, rather than receiving every
    #     message published to the topic.
    #
    #   * `RawMessageDelivery` – When set to `true`, enables raw message
    #     delivery to Amazon SQS or HTTP/S endpoints. This eliminates the
    #     need for the endpoints to process JSON formatting, which is
    #     otherwise created for Amazon SNS metadata.
    #
    #   * `RedrivePolicy` – When specified, sends undeliverable messages to
    #     the specified Amazon SQS dead-letter queue. Messages that can't
    #     be delivered due to client errors (for example, when the
    #     subscribed endpoint is unreachable) or server errors (for example,
    #     when the service that powers the subscribed endpoint becomes
    #     unavailable) are held in the dead-letter queue for further
    #     analysis or reprocessing.
    #
    #   The following attribute applies only to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
    #   delivery stream subscriptions:
    #
    #   * `SubscriptionRoleArn` – The ARN of the IAM role that has the
    #     following:
    #
    #     * Permission to write to the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream
    #
    #     * Amazon SNS listed as a trusted entity
    #
    #     Specifying a valid ARN for this attribute is required for Kinesis
    #     Data Firehose delivery stream subscriptions. For more information,
    #     see [Fanout to Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams][1] in the
    #     *Amazon SNS Developer Guide*.
