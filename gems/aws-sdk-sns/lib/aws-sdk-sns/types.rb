    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] target_arn
    #   If you don't specify a value for the `TargetArn` parameter, you

    #   @return [String]
    #

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] message
    #   The message you want to send.
    #
    #   The `Message` parameter is always a string. If you set
    #   `MessageStructure` to `json`, you must string-encode the `Message`
    #   parameter.
    #
    #   If you are publishing to a topic and you want to send the same
    #   message to all transport protocols, include the text of the message
    #   as a String value. If you want to send different messages for each
    #   transport protocol, set the value of the `MessageStructure`
    #   parameter to `json` and use a JSON object for the `Message`
    #   parameter.
    #
    #
    #
    #   Constraints:
    #
    #   * With the exception of SMS, messages must be UTF-8 encoded strings
    #     and at most 256 KB in size (262,144 bytes, not 262,144
    #     characters).
    #
    #   * For SMS, each message can contain up to 140 characters. This
    #     character limit depends on the encoding schema. For example, an
    #     SMS message can contain 160 GSM characters, 140 ASCII characters,
    #     or 70 UCS-2 characters.
    #
    #     If you publish a message that exceeds this size limit, Amazon SNS
    #     sends the message as multiple messages, each fitting within the
    #     size limit. Messages aren't truncated mid-word but are cut off at
    #     whole-word boundaries.
    #
    #     The total size limit for a single SMS `Publish` action is 1,600
    #     characters.
    #
    #   JSON-specific constraints:
    #
    #   * Keys in the JSON object that correspond to supported transport
    #     protocols must have simple JSON string values.
    #
    #   * The values will be parsed (unescaped) before they are used in
    #     outgoing messages.
    #
    #   * Outbound notifications are JSON encoded (meaning that the
    #     characters will be reescaped for sending).
    #
    #   * Values have a minimum length of 0 (the empty string, "", is
    #     allowed).
    #
    #   * Values have a maximum length bounded by the overall message size
    #     (so, including multiple protocols may limit message sizes).
    #
    #   * Non-string values will cause the key to be ignored.
    #
    #   * Keys that do not correspond to supported transport protocols are
    #     ignored.
    #
    #   * Duplicate keys are not allowed.
    #
    #   * Failure to parse or validate any key or value in the message will
    #     cause the `Publish` call to return an error (no partial delivery).
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] subject
    #   Optional parameter to be used as the "Subject" line when the
    #   message is delivered to email endpoints. This field will also be
    #   included, if present, in the standard JSON messages delivered to
    #   other endpoints.
    #
    #   Constraints: Subjects must be ASCII text that begins with a letter,
    #   number, or punctuation mark; must not include line breaks or control
    #   characters; and must be less than 100 characters long.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] message_structure
    #   Set `MessageStructure` to `json` if you want to send a different
    #   message for each protocol. For example, using one publish action,
    #   you can send a short message to your SMS subscribers and a longer
    #   message to your email subscribers. If you set `MessageStructure` to
    #   `json`, the value of the `Message` parameter must:
    #
    #   * be a syntactically valid JSON object; and
    #
    #   * contain at least a top-level JSON key of "default" with a value
    #     that is a string.
    #
    #   You can define other top-level keys that define the message you want
    #   to send to a specific transport protocol (e.g., "http").
    #
    #   For information about sending different messages for each protocol
    #   using the AWS Management Console, go to [Create Different Messages
    #   for Each Protocol][1] in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service
    #   Getting Started Guide*.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] attributes
    #   The default settings for sending SMS messages from your account. You
    #   can set values for the following attribute names:
    #
    #   `MonthlySpendLimit` – The maximum amount in USD that you are willing
    #   to spend each month to send SMS messages. When Amazon SNS determines
    #   that sending an SMS message would incur a cost that exceeds this
    #   limit, it stops sending SMS messages within minutes.
    #
    #   Amazon SNS stops sending SMS messages within minutes of the limit
    #   being crossed. During that interval, if you continue to send SMS
    #   messages, you will incur costs that exceed your limit.
    #
    #   By default, the spend limit is set to the maximum allowed by Amazon
    #   SNS. If you want to raise the limit, submit an [SNS Limit Increase
    #   case][1]. For **New limit value**, enter your desired monthly spend
    #   limit. In the **Use Case Description** field, explain that you are
    #   requesting an SMS monthly spend limit increase.
    #
    #   `DeliveryStatusIAMRole` – The ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon
    #   SNS to write logs about SMS deliveries in CloudWatch Logs. For each
    #   SMS message that you send, Amazon SNS writes a log that includes the
    #   message price, the success or failure status, the reason for failure
    #   (if the message failed), the message dwell time, and other
    #   information.
    #
    #   `DeliveryStatusSuccessSamplingRate` – The percentage of successful
    #   SMS deliveries for which Amazon SNS will write logs in CloudWatch
    #   Logs. The value can be an integer from 0 - 100. For example, to
    #   write logs only for failed deliveries, set this value to `0`. To
    #   write logs for 10% of your successful deliveries, set it to `10`.
    #
    #   `DefaultSenderID` – A string, such as your business brand, that is
    #   displayed as the sender on the receiving device. Support for sender
    #   IDs varies by country. The sender ID can be 1 - 11 alphanumeric
    #   characters, and it must contain at least one letter.
    #
    #   `DefaultSMSType` – The type of SMS message that you will send by
    #   default. You can assign the following values:
    #
    #   * `Promotional` – (Default) Noncritical messages, such as marketing
    #     messages. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to incur the
    #     lowest cost.
    #
    #   * `Transactional` – Critical messages that support customer
    #     transactions, such as one-time passcodes for multi-factor
    #     authentication. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to
    #     achieve the highest reliability.
    #
    #   `UsageReportS3Bucket` – The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to receive
    #   daily SMS usage reports from Amazon SNS. Each day, Amazon SNS will
    #   deliver a usage report as a CSV file to the bucket. The report
    #   includes the following information for each SMS message that was
    #   successfully delivered by your account:
    #
    #   * Time that the message was published (in UTC)
    #
    #   * Message ID
    #
    #   * Destination phone number
    #
    #   * Message type
    #
    #   * Delivery status
    #
    #   * Message price (in USD)
    #
    #   * Part number (a message is split into multiple parts if it is too
    #     long for a single message)
    #
    #   * Total number of parts
    #
    #   To receive the report, the bucket must have a policy that allows the
    #   Amazon SNS service principle to perform the `s3:PutObject` and
    #   `s3:GetBucketLocation` actions.
    #
    #   For an example bucket policy and usage report, see [Monitoring SMS
    #   Activity][2] in the *Amazon SNS Developer Guide*.

    #     message published to the topic.
    #
    #   * `RawMessageDelivery` – When set to `true`, enables raw message

    #   special request parameters that the `SetTopicAttributes` action
    #   uses:
    #
    #   * `DeliveryPolicy` – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries
    #     failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.
    #
    #   * `DisplayName` – The display name to use for a topic with SMS
    #     subscriptions.
    #
    #   * `Policy` – The policy that defines who can access your topic. By
    #     default, only the topic owner can publish or subscribe to the
    #     topic.
    #
    #   The following attribute applies only to
    #   [server-side-encryption][1]\:
    #
    #   * `KmsMasterKeyId` - The ID of an AWS-managed customer master key
    #     (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more information, see

    #   The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the
    #   special request parameters that the `SetTopicAttributes` action
    #   uses:
    #
    #   * `DeliveryPolicy` – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries
    #     failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.
    #
    #   * `FilterPolicy` – The simple JSON object that lets your subscriber
    #     receive only a subset of messages, rather than receiving every
    #     message published to the topic.
    #
    #   * `RawMessageDelivery` – When set to `true`, enables raw message
    #     delivery to Amazon SQS or HTTP/S endpoints. This eliminates the
    #     need for the endpoints to process JSON formatting, which is
    #     otherwise created for Amazon SNS metadata.
    #   @return [Hash<String,String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] return_subscription_arn
    #   Sets whether the response from the `Subscribe` request includes the
    #   subscription ARN, even if the subscription is not yet confirmed.
    #
    #   If you set this parameter to `false`, the response includes the ARN
    #   for confirmed subscriptions, but it includes an ARN value of
