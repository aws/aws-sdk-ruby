    # @overload initialize(options)
    #   @param [Hash] options
    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading static credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleWebIdentityCredentials` - Used when you need to
    #       assume a role after providing credentials via the web.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SSOCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from AWS SSO using an
    #       access token generated from `aws login`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ProcessCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       process that outputs to stdout.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ECSCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from
    #       instances running in ECS.
    #
    #     * `Aws::CognitoIdentityCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from the Cognito Identity service.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2/ECS IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts
    #       are very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #       `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` or `Aws::ECSCredentials` to
    #       enable retries and extended timeouts. Instance profile credential
    #       fetching can be disabled by setting ENV['AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED']
    #       to true.

    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:region]`
    #     * `ENV['AWS_REGION']`
    #     * `ENV['AMAZON_REGION']`
    #     * `ENV['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION']`
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`

    #     The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #     ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #     are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #     checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors, auth errors,
    #     endpoint discovery, and errors from expired credentials.
    #     This option is only used in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_max_delay (0)
    #     The maximum number of seconds to delay between retries (0 for no limit)
    #     used by the default backoff function. This option is only used in the

    #
    #     * `standard` - A standardized set of retry rules across the AWS SDKs.
    #       This includes support for retry quotas, which limit the number of
    #       unsuccessful retries a client can make.
    #
    #     * `adaptive` - An experimental retry mode that includes all the
    #       functionality of `standard` mode along with automatic client side
    #       throttling.  This is a provisional mode that may change behavior
    #       in the future.

    #     is set to `true`.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #     When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #     sending the request.
    #
    #   @option options [URI::HTTP,String] :http_proxy A proxy to send
    #     requests through.  Formatted like 'http://proxy.com:123'.

    #     "Expect" header set to "100-continue".  Defaults to `nil` which
    #     disables this behaviour.  This value can safely be set per
    #     request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :ssl_timeout (nil) Sets the SSL timeout
    #     in seconds.

    #
    #   * `DeliveryPolicy` – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries
    #     failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.
    #
    #   * `DisplayName` – The display name to use for a topic with SMS
    #     subscriptions.
    #
    #   * `FifoTopic` – Set to true to create a FIFO topic.
    #
    #   * `Policy` – The policy that defines who can access your topic. By
    #     default, only the topic owner can publish or subscribe to the topic.
    #
    #   The following attribute applies only to [server-side encryption][1]\:
    #
    #   * `KmsMasterKeyId` – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer
    #     master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more
    #     information, see [Key Terms][2]. For more examples, see [KeyId][3]

    #
    #   * `ContentBasedDeduplication` – Enables content-based deduplication
    #     for FIFO topics.
    #
    #     * By default, `ContentBasedDeduplication` is set to `false`. If you
    #       create a FIFO topic and this attribute is `false`, you must
    #       specify a value for the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for the
    #       [Publish][5] action.
    #
    #     * When you set `ContentBasedDeduplication` to `true`, Amazon SNS
    #       uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId` using
    #       the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).
    #
    #       (Optional) To override the generated value, you can specify a
    #       value for the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for the `Publish`

    # Sends a message to an Amazon SNS topic, a text message (SMS message)
    # directly to a phone number, or a message to a mobile platform endpoint
    # (when you specify the `TargetArn`).
    #
    # If you send a message to a topic, Amazon SNS delivers the message to
    # each endpoint that is subscribed to the topic. The format of the
    # message depends on the notification protocol for each subscribed
    # endpoint.
    #
    # When a `messageId` is returned, the message is saved and Amazon SNS
    # immediately delivers it to subscribers.
    #
    # To use the `Publish` action for publishing a message to a mobile
    # endpoint, such as an app on a Kindle device or mobile phone, you must
    # specify the EndpointArn for the TargetArn parameter. The EndpointArn
    # is returned when making a call with the `CreatePlatformEndpoint`
    # action.
    #
    # For more information about formatting messages, see [Send Custom
    # Platform-Specific Payloads in Messages to Mobile Devices][1].
    #
    # You can publish messages only to topics and endpoints in the same
    # Amazon Web Services Region.

    #
    # @option params [String] :topic_arn
    #   The topic you want to publish to.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for the `TopicArn` parameter, you must
    #   specify a value for the `PhoneNumber` or `TargetArn` parameters.
    #
    # @option params [String] :target_arn
    #   If you don't specify a value for the `TargetArn` parameter, you must
    #   specify a value for the `PhoneNumber` or `TopicArn` parameters.
    #
    # @option params [String] :phone_number
    #   The phone number to which you want to deliver an SMS message. Use
    #   E.164 format.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for the `PhoneNumber` parameter, you
    #   must specify a value for the `TargetArn` or `TopicArn` parameters.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :message
    #   The message you want to send.
    #
    #   If you are publishing to a topic and you want to send the same message
    #   to all transport protocols, include the text of the message as a
    #   String value. If you want to send different messages for each
    #   transport protocol, set the value of the `MessageStructure` parameter
    #   to `json` and use a JSON object for the `Message` parameter.
    #
    #
    #
    #   Constraints:
    #
    #   * With the exception of SMS, messages must be UTF-8 encoded strings
    #     and at most 256 KB in size (262,144 bytes, not 262,144 characters).
    #
    #   * For SMS, each message can contain up to 140 characters. This
    #     character limit depends on the encoding schema. For example, an SMS
    #     message can contain 160 GSM characters, 140 ASCII characters, or 70
    #     UCS-2 characters.
    #
    #     If you publish a message that exceeds this size limit, Amazon SNS
    #     sends the message as multiple messages, each fitting within the size
    #     limit. Messages aren't truncated mid-word but are cut off at
    #     whole-word boundaries.
    #
    #     The total size limit for a single SMS `Publish` action is 1,600
    #     characters.
    #
    #   JSON-specific constraints:
    #
    #   * Keys in the JSON object that correspond to supported transport
    #     protocols must have simple JSON string values.
    #
    #   * The values will be parsed (unescaped) before they are used in
    #     outgoing messages.
    #
    #   * Outbound notifications are JSON encoded (meaning that the characters
    #     will be reescaped for sending).
    #
    #   * Values have a minimum length of 0 (the empty string, "", is
    #     allowed).
    #
    #   * Values have a maximum length bounded by the overall message size
    #     (so, including multiple protocols may limit message sizes).
    #
    #   * Non-string values will cause the key to be ignored.
    #
    #   * Keys that do not correspond to supported transport protocols are
    #     ignored.
    #
    #   * Duplicate keys are not allowed.
    #
    #   * Failure to parse or validate any key or value in the message will
    #     cause the `Publish` call to return an error (no partial delivery).
    #
    # @option params [String] :subject
    #   Optional parameter to be used as the "Subject" line when the message
    #   is delivered to email endpoints. This field will also be included, if
    #   present, in the standard JSON messages delivered to other endpoints.
    #
    #   Constraints: Subjects must be ASCII text that begins with a letter,
    #   number, or punctuation mark; must not include line breaks or control
    #   characters; and must be less than 100 characters long.
    #
    # @option params [String] :message_structure
    #   Set `MessageStructure` to `json` if you want to send a different
    #   message for each protocol. For example, using one publish action, you
    #   can send a short message to your SMS subscribers and a longer message
    #   to your email subscribers. If you set `MessageStructure` to `json`,
    #   the value of the `Message` parameter must:
    #
    #   * be a syntactically valid JSON object; and
    #
    #   * contain at least a top-level JSON key of "default" with a value
    #     that is a string.
    #
    #   You can define other top-level keys that define the message you want
    #   to send to a specific transport protocol (e.g., "http").
    #
    #   Valid value: `json`
    #
    # @option params [Hash<String,Types::MessageAttributeValue>] :message_attributes
    #   Message attributes for Publish action.
    #
    # @option params [String] :message_deduplication_id
    #   This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) topics. The
    #   `MessageDeduplicationId` can contain up to 128 alphanumeric characters
    #   `(a-z, A-Z, 0-9)` and punctuation ``
    #   (!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`\{|\}~) ``.
    #
    #   Every message must have a unique `MessageDeduplicationId`, which is a
    #   token used for deduplication of sent messages. If a message with a
    #   particular `MessageDeduplicationId` is sent successfully, any message
    #   sent with the same `MessageDeduplicationId` during the 5-minute
    #   deduplication interval is treated as a duplicate.
    #
    #   If the topic has `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, the system generates
    #   a `MessageDeduplicationId` based on the contents of the message. Your
    #   `MessageDeduplicationId` overrides the generated one.
    #
    # @option params [String] :message_group_id
    #   This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) topics. The
    #   `MessageGroupId` can contain up to 128 alphanumeric characters `(a-z,
    #   A-Z, 0-9)` and punctuation `` (!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`\{|\}~) ``.
    #
    #   The `MessageGroupId` is a tag that specifies that a message belongs to
    #   a specific message group. Messages that belong to the same message
    #   group are processed in a FIFO manner (however, messages in different
    #   message groups might be processed out of order). Every message must
    #   include a `MessageGroupId`.

    #   The default settings for sending SMS messages from your Amazon Web
    #   Services account. You can set values for the following attribute
    #   names:
    #
    #   `MonthlySpendLimit` – The maximum amount in USD that you are willing
    #   to spend each month to send SMS messages. When Amazon SNS determines
    #   that sending an SMS message would incur a cost that exceeds this
    #   limit, it stops sending SMS messages within minutes.
    #
    #   Amazon SNS stops sending SMS messages within minutes of the limit
    #   being crossed. During that interval, if you continue to send SMS
    #   messages, you will incur costs that exceed your limit.
    #
    #   By default, the spend limit is set to the maximum allowed by Amazon
    #   SNS. If you want to raise the limit, submit an [SNS Limit Increase
    #   case][1]. For **New limit value**, enter your desired monthly spend
    #   limit. In the **Use Case Description** field, explain that you are
    #   requesting an SMS monthly spend limit increase.
    #
    #   `DeliveryStatusIAMRole` – The ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon
    #   SNS to write logs about SMS deliveries in CloudWatch Logs. For each
    #   SMS message that you send, Amazon SNS writes a log that includes the
    #   message price, the success or failure status, the reason for failure
    #   (if the message failed), the message dwell time, and other
    #   information.
    #
    #   `DeliveryStatusSuccessSamplingRate` – The percentage of successful SMS
    #   deliveries for which Amazon SNS will write logs in CloudWatch Logs.
    #   The value can be an integer from 0 - 100. For example, to write logs
    #   only for failed deliveries, set this value to `0`. To write logs for
    #   10% of your successful deliveries, set it to `10`.
    #
    #   `DefaultSenderID` – A string, such as your business brand, that is
    #   displayed as the sender on the receiving device. Support for sender
    #   IDs varies by country. The sender ID can be 1 - 11 alphanumeric
    #   characters, and it must contain at least one letter.
    #
    #   `DefaultSMSType` – The type of SMS message that you will send by
    #   default. You can assign the following values:
    #
    #   * `Promotional` – (Default) Noncritical messages, such as marketing
    #     messages. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to incur the
    #     lowest cost.
    #
    #   * `Transactional` – Critical messages that support customer
    #     transactions, such as one-time passcodes for multi-factor
    #     authentication. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to achieve
    #     the highest reliability.
    #
    #   `UsageReportS3Bucket` – The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to receive
    #   daily SMS usage reports from Amazon SNS. Each day, Amazon SNS will
    #   deliver a usage report as a CSV file to the bucket. The report
    #   includes the following information for each SMS message that was
    #   successfully delivered by your Amazon Web Services account:
    #
    #   * Time that the message was published (in UTC)
    #
    #   * Message ID
    #
    #   * Destination phone number
    #
    #   * Message type
    #
    #   * Delivery status
    #
    #   * Message price (in USD)
    #
    #   * Part number (a message is split into multiple parts if it is too
    #     long for a single message)
    #
    #   * Total number of parts
    #
    #   To receive the report, the bucket must have a policy that allows the
    #   Amazon SNS service principal to perform the `s3:PutObject` and
    #   `s3:GetBucketLocation` actions.
    #
    #   For an example bucket policy and usage report, see [Monitoring SMS
    #   Activity][2] in the *Amazon SNS Developer Guide*.

    #
    #   * `RawMessageDelivery` – When set to `true`, enables raw message

    #
    #   * `DeliveryPolicy` – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries
    #     failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.
    #
    #   * `DisplayName` – The display name to use for a topic with SMS
    #     subscriptions.

    #
    #   The following attribute applies only to [FIFO topics][4]\:
    #
    #   * `ContentBasedDeduplication` – Enables content-based deduplication
    #     for FIFO topics.
    #
    #     * By default, `ContentBasedDeduplication` is set to `false`. If you
    #       create a FIFO topic and this attribute is `false`, you must
    #       specify a value for the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for the
    #       [Publish][5] action.
    #
    #     * When you set `ContentBasedDeduplication` to `true`, Amazon SNS
    #       uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId` using
    #       the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).
    #
    #       (Optional) To override the generated value, you can specify a
    #       value for the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for the `Publish`
