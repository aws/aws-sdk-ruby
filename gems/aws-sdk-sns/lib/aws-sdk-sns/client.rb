    # @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #   Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #   following classes:
    #
    #   * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #     credentials.
    #
    #   * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #     from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #   * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #     shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #   * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #   When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #   locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #   * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #   * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #   * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #   * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #   * `~/.aws/config`
    #   * EC2 IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts are
    #     very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #     `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` to enable retries and extended
    #     timeouts.
    #
    # @option options [required, String] :region
    #   The AWS region to connect to.  The configured `:region` is
    #   used to determine the service `:endpoint`. When not passed,
    #   a default `:region` is search for in the following locations:
    #
    #   * `Aws.config[:region]`
    #   * `ENV['AWS_REGION']`
    #   * `ENV['AMAZON_REGION']`
    #   * `ENV['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION']`
    #   * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #   * `~/.aws/config`
    #
    # @option options [String] :access_key_id
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :convert_params (true)
    #   When `true`, an attempt is made to coerce request parameters into
    #   the required types.
    #
    # @option options [String] :endpoint
    #   The client endpoint is normally constructed from the `:region`
    #   option. You should only configure an `:endpoint` when connecting
    #   to test endpoints. This should be avalid HTTP(S) URI.
    #
    # @option options [Aws::Log::Formatter] :log_formatter (Aws::Log::Formatter.default)
    #   The log formatter.
    #
    # @option options [Symbol] :log_level (:info)
    #   The log level to send messages to the `:logger` at.
    #
    # @option options [Logger] :logger
    #   The Logger instance to send log messages to.  If this option
    #   is not set, logging will be disabled.
    #
    # @option options [String] :profile ("default")
    #   Used when loading credentials from the shared credentials file
    #   at HOME/.aws/credentials.  When not specified, 'default' is used.
    #
    # @option options [Integer] :retry_limit (3)
    #   The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #   ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #   are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #   checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors and auth
    #   errors from expired credentials.
    #
    # @option options [String] :secret_access_key
    #
    # @option options [String] :session_token
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #   Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #   fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #   the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #   {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #   ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #   requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #   When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #   sending the request.

    #   size (262144 bytes, not 262144 characters).
    #
    #   JSON-specific constraints:
    #
    #   * Keys in the JSON object that correspond to supported transport
    #     protocols must have simple JSON string values.
    #
    #   * The values will be parsed (unescaped) before they are used in
    #     outgoing messages.
    #
    #   * Outbound notifications are JSON encoded (meaning that the characters
    #     will be reescaped for sending).
    #
    #   * Values have a minimum length of 0 (the empty string, "", is
    #     allowed).
    #
    #   * Values have a maximum length bounded by the overall message size
    #     (so, including multiple protocols may limit message sizes).
    #
    #   * Non-string values will cause the key to be ignored.
    #
    #   * Keys that do not correspond to supported transport protocols are
    #     ignored.
    #
    #   * Duplicate keys are not allowed.
    #
    #   * Failure to parse or validate any key or value in the message will
    #     cause the `Publish` call to return an error (no partial delivery).
    #
    # @option params [String] :subject
    #   Optional parameter to be used as the "Subject" line when the message
    #   is delivered to email endpoints. This field will also be included, if
    #   present, in the standard JSON messages delivered to other endpoints.
    #
    #   Constraints: Subjects must be ASCII text that begins with a letter,
    #   number, or punctuation mark; must not include line breaks or control
    #   characters; and must be less than 100 characters long.
    #
    # @option params [String] :message_structure
    #   Set `MessageStructure` to `json` if you want to send a different
    #   message for each protocol. For example, using one publish action, you
    #   can send a short message to your SMS subscribers and a longer message
    #   to your email subscribers. If you set `MessageStructure` to `json`,
    #   the value of the `Message` parameter must:

    #   * be a syntactically valid JSON object; and
    #
    #   * contain at least a top-level JSON key of "default" with a value
    #     that is a string.
    #
    #   You can define other top-level keys that define the message you want

    #
    # @option params [required, Hash<String,String>] :attributes
    #   The default settings for sending SMS messages from your account. You
    #   can set values for the following attribute names:
    #
    #   `MonthlySpendLimit` – The maximum amount in USD that you are willing
    #   to spend each month to send SMS messages. When Amazon SNS determines
    #   that sending an SMS message would incur a cost that exceeds this
    #   limit, it stops sending SMS messages within minutes.
    #
    #   Amazon SNS stops sending SMS messages within minutes of the limit
    #   being crossed. During that interval, if you continue to send SMS
    #   messages, you will incur costs that exceed your limit.
    #
    #   By default, the spend limit is set to the maximum allowed by Amazon
    #   SNS. If you want to exceed the maximum, contact [AWS Support][1] or
    #   your AWS sales representative for a service limit increase.
    #
    #   `DeliveryStatusIAMRole` – The ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon
    #   SNS to write logs about SMS deliveries in CloudWatch Logs. For each
    #   SMS message that you send, Amazon SNS writes a log that includes the
    #   message price, the success or failure status, the reason for failure
    #   (if the message failed), the message dwell time, and other
    #   information.
    #
    #   `DeliveryStatusSuccessSamplingRate` – The percentage of successful SMS
    #   deliveries for which Amazon SNS will write logs in CloudWatch Logs.
    #   The value can be an integer from 0 - 100. For example, to write logs
    #   only for failed deliveries, set this value to `0`. To write logs for
    #   10% of your successful deliveries, set it to `10`.
    #
    #   `DefaultSenderID` – A string, such as your business brand, that is
    #   displayed as the sender on the receiving device. Support for sender
    #   IDs varies by country. The sender ID can be 1 - 11 alphanumeric
    #   characters, and it must contain at least one letter.
    #
    #   `DefaultSMSType` – The type of SMS message that you will send by
    #   default. You can assign the following values:
    #
    #   * `Promotional` – (Default) Noncritical messages, such as marketing
    #     messages. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to incur the
    #     lowest cost.
    #
    #   * `Transactional` – Critical messages that support customer
    #     transactions, such as one-time passcodes for multi-factor
    #     authentication. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to achieve
    #     the highest reliability.
    #
    #   `UsageReportS3Bucket` – The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to receive
    #   daily SMS usage reports from Amazon SNS. Each day, Amazon SNS will
    #   deliver a usage report as a CSV file to the bucket. The report
    #   includes the following information for each SMS message that was
    #   successfully delivered by your account:
    #
    #   * Time that the message was published (in UTC)
    #
    #   * Message ID
    #
    #   * Destination phone number
    #
    #   * Message type
    #
    #   * Delivery status
    #
    #   * Message price (in USD)
    #
    #   * Part number (a message is split into multiple parts if it is too
    #     long for a single message)
    #
    #   * Total number of parts
    #
    #   To receive the report, the bucket must have a policy that allows the
    #   Amazon SNS service principle to perform the `s3:PutObject` and
    #   `s3:GetBucketLocation` actions.
    #
    #   For an example bucket policy and usage report, see [Monitoring SMS
    #   Activity][2] in the *Amazon SNS Developer Guide*.
