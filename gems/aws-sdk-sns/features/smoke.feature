Feature: Smoke tests for SNS

  @sns @smoke
  Scenario: ListTopicsSuccess
    Given I create a 'Aws::SNS' client with config:
      """
{"region":"us-west-2"}
      """
    When I call the operation 'list_topics' with params:
      """
{}
      """
    Then I expect an error was not raised

  @sns @smoke
  Scenario: PublishFailure
    Given I create a 'Aws::SNS' client with config:
      """
{"region":"us-west-2"}
      """
    When I call the operation 'publish' with params:
      """
{"message":"hello","topic_arn":"fake_topic"}
      """
    Then I expect an error was raised
