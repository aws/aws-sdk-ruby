    #
    # @!attribute [rw] raw_value

    #   depends on the format of the data in the cell. However the attribute
    #   in the API return value is always a string containing the raw value.
    #
    #   Cells with format DATE, DATE\_TIME or TIME have the raw value as a
    #   floating point number where the whole number represents the number
    #   of days since 1/1/1900 and the fractional part represents the
    #   fraction of the day since midnight. For example, a cell with date
    #   11/3/2020 has the raw value "44138". A cell with the time 9:00 AM
    #   has the raw value "0.375" and a cell with date/time value of
    #   11/3/2020 9:00 AM has the raw value "44138.375". Notice that even
    #   though the raw value is a number in all three cases, it is still
    #   represented as a string.
    #
    #   Cells with format NUMBER, CURRENCY, PERCENTAGE and ACCOUNTING have
    #   the raw value of the data as the number representing the data being
    #   displayed. For example, the number 1.325 with two decimal places in
    #   the format will have it's raw value as "1.325" and formatted
    #   value as "1.33". A currency value for $10 will have the raw value
    #   as "10" and formatted value as "$10.00". A value representing
    #   20% with two decimal places in the format will have its raw value as
    #   "0.2" and the formatted value as "20.00%". An accounting value
    #   of -$25 will have "-25" as the raw value and "$ (25.00)" as the
    #   formatted value.
    #
    #   Cells with format TEXT will have the raw text as the raw value. For
    #   example, a cell with text "John Smith" will have "John Smith" as
    #   both the raw value and the formatted value.
    #
    #   Cells with format CONTACT will have the name of the contact as a
    #   formatted value and the email address of the contact as the raw
    #   value. For example, a contact for John Smith will have "John
    #   Smith" as the formatted value and "john.smith@example.com" as the
    #   raw value.
    #
    #   Cells with format ROWLINK (aka picklist) will have the first column
    #   of the linked row as the formatted value and the row id of the
    #   linked row as the raw value. For example, a cell containing a
    #   picklist to a table that displays task status might have
    #   "Completed" as the formatted value and
    #   "row:dfcefaee-5b37-4355-8f28-40c3e4ff5dd4/ca432b2f-b8eb-431d-9fb5-cbe0342f9f03"
    #   as the raw value.
    #
    #   Cells with format AUTO or cells without any format that are
    #   auto-detected as one of the formats above will contain the raw and
    #   formatted values as mentioned above, based on the auto-detected
    #   formats. If there is no auto-detected format, the raw and formatted
    #   values will be the same as the data in the cell.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] formatted_value
    #   The formatted value of the cell. This is the value that you see

    #
    #   Note that the formatted value of a cell is always represented as a
    #   string irrespective of the data that is stored in the cell. For
    #   example, if a cell contains a date, the formatted value of the cell
    #   is the string representation of the formatted date being shown in
