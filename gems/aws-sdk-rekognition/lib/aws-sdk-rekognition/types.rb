    #   corner of the image is the origin (0,0).
    #
    #   The `top` and `left` values returned are ratios of the overall image
    #   size. For example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the
    #   top-left coordinate of the bounding box is 350x50 pixels, the API
    #   returns a `left` value of 0.5 (350/700) and a `top` value of 0.25
    #   (50/200).

    #   A threshold used to determine the maximum luminance value for a

    #   values range from 0-255. A pixel value of 0 is pure black, and the
    #   most strict filter. The maximum black pixel value is computed as
    #   follows: max\_black\_pixel\_value = minimum\_luminance +
    #   MaxPixelThreshold *luminance\_range.
    #
    #   For example, for a full range video with BlackPixelThreshold = 0.1,
    #   max\_black\_pixel\_value is 0 + 0.1 * (255-0) = 25.5.
    #
    #   The default value of MaxPixelThreshold is 0.2, which maps to a

    #   matrix.

    #   the frame are black pixels as per the `MaxPixelThreshold` set. You
