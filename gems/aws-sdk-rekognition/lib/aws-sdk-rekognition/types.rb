    # might have an estimated range of 4-8.
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] low

    # Identifies the bounding box around the label, face, or text. The
    # `left` (x-coordinate) and `top` (y-coordinate) are coordinates
    # representing the top and left sides of the bounding box. Note that the
    # upper-left corner of the image is the origin (0,0).
    #
    # The `top` and `left` values returned are ratios of the overall image
    # size. For example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the
    # top-left coordinate of the bounding box is 350x50 pixels, the API
    # returns a `left` value of 0.5 (350/700) and a `top` value of 0.25
    # (50/200).
    #
    # The `width` and `height` values represent the dimensions of the
    # bounding box as a ratio of the overall image dimension. For example,
    # if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the bounding box width is 70
    # pixels, the width returned is 0.1.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> The bounding box coordinates can have negative values. For example, if
    # Amazon Rekognition is able to detect a face that is at the image edge
    # and is only partially visible, the service can return coordinates that
    # are outside the image bounds and, depending on the image edge, you
    # might get negative values or values greater than 1 for the `left` or
    # `top` values.

    #   Some examples are an object that's misidentified as a face, a face
    #   that's too blurry, or a face with a pose that's too extreme to
    #   use. If you specify `NONE`, no filtering is performed. The default

    #     exchangeable image file format (Exif) metadata that includes the

    #     information to perform image correction - the bounding box
    #     coordinates are translated to represent object locations after the

    #     the image orientation. Images in .png format don't contain Exif
    #     metadata. The value of `OrientationCorrection` is null.
