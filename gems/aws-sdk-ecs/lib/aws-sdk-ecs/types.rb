    #
    #   * Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
    #
    #   * For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key
    #     can have only one value.
    #
    #   * Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
    #
    #   * Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
    #
    #   * If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
    #     resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on
    #     allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
    #     numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following
    #     characters: + - = . \_ : / @.
    #
    #   * Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
    #
    #   * Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination
    #     of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved
    #     for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or

    # @!attribute [rw] cpu
    #   The number of `cpu` units reserved for the container. This parameter
    #   maps to `CpuShares` in the [Create a container][1] section of the
    #   [Docker Remote API][2] and the `--cpu-shares` option to [docker
    #   run][3].
    #
    #   This field is optional for tasks using the Fargate launch type, and
    #   the only requirement is that the total amount of CPU reserved for
    #   all containers within a task be lower than the task-level `cpu`
    #   value.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> You can determine the number of CPU units that are available per EC2
    #   instance type by multiplying the vCPUs listed for that instance type
    #   on the [Amazon EC2 Instances][4] detail page by 1,024.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   Linux containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers
    #   on the container instance with the same ratio as their allocated
    #   amount. For example, if you run a single-container task on a
    #   single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that
    #   container, and that's the only task running on the container
    #   instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at
    #   any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same
    #   task on that container instance, each task is guaranteed a minimum
    #   of 512 CPU units when needed. Moreover, each container could float
    #   to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it. If both
    #   tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512
    #   CPU units.
    #
    #   On Linux container instances, the Docker daemon on the container
    #   instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share
    #   ratios for running containers. For more information, see [CPU share
    #   constraint][5] in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU
    #   share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2. However, the CPU
    #   parameter isn't required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in
    #   your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null),
    #   the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent
    #   version:
    #
    #   * **Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0:** Null and zero CPU
    #     values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to
    #     1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which
    #     the Linux kernel converts to two CPU shares.
    #
    #   * **Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0:** Null, zero, and
    #     CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.
    #
    #   On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an
    #   absolute limit, or a quota. Windows containers only have access to
    #   the specified amount of CPU that's described in the task
    #   definition. A null or zero CPU value is passed to Docker as `0`,
    #   which Windows interprets as 1% of one CPU.

    # @!attribute [rw] memory
    #   The amount (in MiB) of memory to present to the container. If your
    #   container attempts to exceed the memory specified here, the
    #   container is killed. The total amount of memory reserved for all
    #   containers within a task must be lower than the task `memory` value,
    #   if one is specified. This parameter maps to `Memory` in the [Create
    #   a container][1] section of the [Docker Remote API][2] and the
    #   `--memory` option to [docker run][3].
    #
    #   If using the Fargate launch type, this parameter is optional.
    #
    #   If using the EC2 launch type, you must specify either a task-level
    #   memory value or a container-level memory value. If you specify both
    #   a container-level `memory` and `memoryReservation` value, `memory`
    #   must be greater than `memoryReservation`. If you specify
    #   `memoryReservation`, then that value is subtracted from the
    #   available memory resources for the container instance where the
    #   container is placed. Otherwise, the value of `memory` is used.
    #
    #   The Docker 20.10.0 or later daemon reserves a minimum of 6 MiB of
    #   memory for a container, so you should not specify fewer than 6 MiB
    #   of memory for your containers.
    #
    #   The Docker 19.03.13-ce or earlier daemon reserves a minimum of 4 MiB
    #   of memory for a container, so you should not specify fewer than 4
    #   MiB of memory for your containers.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] memory_reservation
    #   The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the container. When
    #   system memory is under heavy contention, Docker attempts to keep the
    #   container memory to this soft limit. However, your container can
    #   consume more memory when it needs to, up to either the hard limit
    #   specified with the `memory` parameter (if applicable), or all of the
    #   available memory on the container instance, whichever comes first.
    #   This parameter maps to `MemoryReservation` in the [Create a
    #   container][1] section of the [Docker Remote API][2] and the
    #   `--memory-reservation` option to [docker run][3].
    #
    #   If a task-level memory value is not specified, you must specify a
    #   non-zero integer for one or both of `memory` or `memoryReservation`
    #   in a container definition. If you specify both, `memory` must be
    #   greater than `memoryReservation`. If you specify
    #   `memoryReservation`, then that value is subtracted from the
    #   available memory resources for the container instance where the
    #   container is placed. Otherwise, the value of `memory` is used.
    #
    #   For example, if your container normally uses 128 MiB of memory, but
    #   occasionally bursts to 256 MiB of memory for short periods of time,
    #   you can set a `memoryReservation` of 128 MiB, and a `memory` hard
    #   limit of 300 MiB. This configuration would allow the container to
    #   only reserve 128 MiB of memory from the remaining resources on the
    #   container instance, but also allow the container to consume more
    #   memory resources when needed.
    #
    #   The Docker daemon reserves a minimum of 4 MiB of memory for a
    #   container. Therefore, we recommend that you specify fewer than 4 MiB
    #   of memory for your containers.

    # @!attribute [rw] links
    #   The `links` parameter allows containers to communicate with each
    #   other without the need for port mappings. This parameter is only
    #   supported if the network mode of a task definition is `bridge`. The
    #   `name:internalName` construct is analogous to `name:alias` in Docker
    #   links. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers,
    #   underscores, and hyphens are allowed. For more information about

    #   receive traffic.
    #
    #   For task definitions that use the `awsvpc` network mode, only
    #   specify the `containerPort`. The `hostPort` can be left blank or it
    #   must be the same value as the `containerPort`.
    #
    #   Port mappings on Windows use the `NetNAT` gateway address rather
    #   than `localhost`. There's no loopback for port mappings on Windows,
    #   so you can't access a container's mapped port from the host
    #   itself.
    #
    #   This parameter maps to `PortBindings` in the [Create a container][1]
    #   section of the [Docker Remote API][2] and the `--publish` option to
    #   [docker run][3]. If the network mode of a task definition is set to
    #   `none`, then you can't specify port mappings. If the network mode
    #   of a task definition is set to `host`, then host ports must either
    #   be undefined or they must match the container port in the port
    #   mapping.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> After a task reaches the `RUNNING` status, manual and automatic host
    #   and container port assignments are visible in the **Network

    # @!attribute [rw] stop_timeout
    #   Time duration (in seconds) to wait before the container is
    #   forcefully killed if it doesn't exit normally on its own.
    #
    #   For tasks using the Fargate launch type, the task or service
    #   requires the following platforms:
    #
    #   * Linux platform version `1.3.0` or later.
    #
    #   * Windows platform version `1.0.0` or later.
    #
    #   The max stop timeout value is 120 seconds and if the parameter is
    #   not specified, the default value of 30 seconds is used.
    #
    #   For tasks that use the EC2 launch type, if the `stopTimeout`
    #   parameter isn't specified, the value set for the Amazon ECS
    #   container agent configuration variable `ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT`
    #   is used. If neither the `stopTimeout` parameter or the
    #   `ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT` agent configuration variable are set,
    #   then the default values of 30 seconds for Linux containers and 30
    #   seconds on Windows containers are used. Your container instances
    #   require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent to enable a
    #   container stop timeout value. However, we recommend using the latest
    #   container agent version. For information about checking your agent
    #   version and updating to the latest version, see [Updating the Amazon
    #   ECS Container Agent][1] in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service
    #   Developer Guide*. If you're using an Amazon ECS-optimized Linux
    #   AMI, your instance needs at least version 1.26.0-1 of the `ecs-init`
    #   package. If your container instances are launched from version
    #   `20190301` or later, then they contain the required versions of the
    #   container agent and `ecs-init`. For more information, see [Amazon

    # from version `20190301` or later, then they contain the required
    # versions of the container agent and `ecs-init`. For more information,
    # see [Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI][2] in the *Amazon Elastic
    # Container Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> For tasks that use the Fargate launch type, the task or service
    # requires the following platforms:
    #
    #  * Linux platform version `1.3.0` or later.

    #
    #   * `START` - This condition emulates the behavior of links and
    #     volumes today. It validates that a dependent container is started
    #     before permitting other containers to start.
    #
    #   * `COMPLETE` - This condition validates that a dependent container
    #     runs to completion (exits) before permitting other containers to
    #     start. This can be useful for nonessential containers that run a
    #     script and then exit. This condition can't be set on an essential
    #     container.
    #
    #   * `SUCCESS` - This condition is the same as `COMPLETE`, but it also
    #     requires that the container exits with a `zero` status. This
    #     condition can't be set on an essential container.
    #
    #   * `HEALTHY` - This condition validates that the dependent container
    #     passes its Docker health check before permitting other containers
    #     to start. This requires that the dependent container has health
    #     checks configured. This condition is confirmed only at task
    #     startup.

    #   `DEREGISTERING`, or `DRAINING`.
    #
    #   If your account has opted in to the `awsvpcTrunking` account
    #   setting, then any newly registered container instance will
    #   transition to a `REGISTERING` status while the trunk elastic network
    #   interface is provisioned for the instance. If the registration
    #   fails, the instance will transition to a `REGISTRATION_FAILED`
    #   status. You can describe the container instance and see the reason
    #   for failure in the `statusReason` parameter. Once the container
    #   instance is terminated, the instance transitions to a
    #   `DEREGISTERING` status while the trunk elastic network interface is
    #   deprovisioned. The instance then transitions to an `INACTIVE`
    #   status.
    #
    #   The `ACTIVE` status indicates that the container instance can accept
    #   tasks. The `DRAINING` indicates that new tasks aren't placed on the
    #   container instance and any service tasks running on the container
    #   instance are removed if possible. For more information, see

    #   The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and
    #   lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed. Service
    #   names must be unique within a cluster, but you can have similarly

    # @!attribute [rw] task_definition

    #   task definition to run in your service. If a `revision` isn't
    #   specified, the latest `ACTIVE` revision is used.
    #
    #   A task definition must be specified if the service uses either the
    #   `ECS` or `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controllers.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] load_balancers
    #   A load balancer object representing the load balancers to use with
    #   your service. For more information, see [Service Load Balancing][1]
    #   in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   If the service uses the rolling update (`ECS`) deployment controller
    #   and using either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load
    #   Balancer, you must specify one or more target group ARNs to attach
    #   to the service. The service-linked role is required for services
    #   that use multiple target groups. For more information, see [Using
    #   service-linked roles for Amazon ECS][2] in the *Amazon Elastic
    #   Container Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   If the service uses the `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controller, the
    #   service is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or
    #   Network Load Balancer. When creating an CodeDeploy deployment group,
    #   you specify two target groups (referred to as a `targetGroupPair`).
    #   During a deployment, CodeDeploy determines which task set in your
    #   service has the status `PRIMARY`, and it associates one target group
    #   with it. Then, it also associates the other target group with the
    #   replacement task set. The load balancer can also have up to two
    #   listeners: a required listener for production traffic and an
    #   optional listener that you can use to perform validation tests with
    #   Lambda functions before routing production traffic to it.
    #
    #   After you create a service using the `ECS` deployment controller,
    #   the load balancer name or target group ARN, container name, and
    #   container port that's specified in the service definition are
    #   immutable. If you use the `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controller, these
    #   values can be changed when updating the service.
    #
    #   For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this
    #   object must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the
    #   container name, and the container port to access from the load
    #   balancer. The container name must be as it appears in a container
    #   definition. The load balancer name parameter must be omitted. When a
    #   task from this service is placed on a container instance, the
    #   container instance and port combination is registered as a target in
    #   the target group that's specified here.
    #
    #   For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load
    #   balancer name, the container name , and the container port to access
    #   from the load balancer. The container name must be as it appears in
    #   a container definition. The target group ARN parameter must be
    #   omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a container
    #   instance, the container instance is registered with the load
    #   balancer that's specified here.
    #
    #   Services with tasks that use the `awsvpc` network mode (for example,
    #   those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load
    #   Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers aren't
    #   supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these
    #   services, you must choose `ip` as the target type, not `instance`.
    #   This is because tasks that use the `awsvpc` network mode are
    #   associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2
    #   instance.

    #   grace period of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds (about 69 years). During
    #   that time, the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores health check
    #   status. This grace period can prevent the service scheduler from
    #   marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time
    #   to come up.
    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] scheduling_strategy
    #   The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more
    #   information, see [Services][1].
    #
    #   There are two service scheduler strategies available:
    #
    #   * `REPLICA`-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the
    #     desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the
    #     service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can
    #     use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task
    #     placement decisions. This scheduler strategy is required if the
    #     service uses the `CODE_DEPLOY` or `EXTERNAL` deployment controller
    #     types.
    #
    #   * `DAEMON`-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task
    #     on each active container instance that meets all of the task
    #     placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The
    #     service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints
    #     for running tasks and will stop tasks that don't meet the
    #     placement constraints. When you're using this strategy, you
    #     don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement
    #     strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the `CODE_DEPLOY` or
    #     `EXTERNAL` deployment controller types don't support the `DAEMON`
    #     scheduling strategy.

    #
    #   * Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
    #
    #   * If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
    #     resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on
    #     allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
    #     numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following
    #     characters: + - = . \_ : / @.
    #
    #   * Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
    #
    #   * Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination
    #     of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved

    # An object representing a container health check. Health check
    # parameters that are specified in a container definition override any
    # Docker health checks that exist in the container image (such as those
    # specified in a parent image or from the image's Dockerfile).
    #
    # You can view the health status of both individual containers and a
    # task with the DescribeTasks API operation or when viewing the task
    # details in the console.
    #
    # The following describes the possible `healthStatus` values for a
    # container:
    #
    # * `HEALTHY`-The container health check has passed successfully.
    #
    # * `UNHEALTHY`-The container health check has failed.
    #
    # * `UNKNOWN`-The container health check is being evaluated or there's
    #   no container health check defined.
    #
    # The following describes the possible `healthStatus` values for a task.
    # The container health check status of nonessential containers do not
    # have an effect on the health status of a task.
    #
    # * `HEALTHY`-All essential containers within the task have passed their
    #   health checks.
    #
    # * `UNHEALTHY`-One or more essential containers have failed their
    #   health check.
    #
    # * `UNKNOWN`-The essential containers within the task are still having
    #   their health checks evaluated or there are no container health
    #   checks defined.
    #
    # If a task is run manually, and not as part of a service, the task will
    # continue its lifecycle regardless of its health status. For tasks that
    # are part of a service, if the task reports as unhealthy then the task
    # will be stopped and the service scheduler will replace it.
    #
    # The following are notes about container health check support:
    #
    # * Container health checks require version 1.17.0 or greater of the
    #   Amazon ECS container agent. For more information, see [Updating the
    #   Amazon ECS Container Agent][1].
    #
    # * Container health checks are supported for Fargate tasks if you're
    #   using platform version 1.1.0 or greater. For more information, see
    #   [Fargate Platform Versions][2].
    #
    # * Container health checks aren't supported for tasks that are part of
    #   a service that's configured to use a Classic Load Balancer.

    #   [docker run][1]. This parameter requires version 1.25 of the Docker
    #   Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the
    #   Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your

    # @!attribute [rw] max_swap
    #   The total amount of swap memory (in MiB) a container can use. This
    #   parameter will be translated to the `--memory-swap` option to
    #   [docker run][1] where the value would be the sum of the container
    #   memory plus the `maxSwap` value.
    #
    #   If a `maxSwap` value of `0` is specified, the container will not use
    #   swap. Accepted values are `0` or any positive integer. If the
    #   `maxSwap` parameter is omitted, the container will use the swap
    #   configuration for the container instance it is running on. A
    #   `maxSwap` value must be set for the `swappiness` parameter to be

    #   This allows you to tune a container's memory swappiness behavior. A
    #   `swappiness` value of `0` will cause swapping to not happen unless
    #   absolutely necessary. A `swappiness` value of `100` will cause pages
    #   to be swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are whole numbers
    #   between `0` and `100`. If the `swappiness` parameter is not
    #   specified, a default value of `60` is used. If a value is not
    #   specified for `maxSwap` then this parameter is ignored. This
    #   parameter maps to the `--memory-swappiness` option to [docker

    # for different supported log drivers, see [Configure logging
    # drivers][4] in the Docker documentation.
    #
    # Understand the following when specifying a log configuration for your
    # containers.
    #
    # * Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers
    #   available to the Docker daemon (shown in the valid values below).
    #   Additional log drivers may be available in future releases of the
    #   Amazon ECS container agent.
    #
    # * This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or
    #   greater on your container instance.
    #
    # * For tasks that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the Amazon ECS
    #   container agent must register the available logging drivers with the
    #   `ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS` environment variable before
    #   containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration
    #   options. For more information, see [Amazon ECS container agent
    #   configuration][5] in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
    #   Guide*.
    #
    # * For tasks that are on Fargate, because you don't have access to the
    #   underlying infrastructure your tasks are hosted on, any additional
    #   software needed must be installed outside of the task. For example,
    #   the Fluentd output aggregators or a remote host running Logstash to
    #   send Gelf logs to.

    #   you specify a container port and not a host port, your container
    #   automatically receives a host port in the ephemeral port range. For
    #   more information, see `hostPort`. Port mappings that are

    # @!attribute [rw] host_port
    #   The port number on the container instance to reserve for your
    #   container.
    #
    #   If you use containers in a task with the `awsvpc` or `host` network
    #   mode, the `hostPort` can either be left blank or set to the same
    #   value as the `containerPort`.
    #
    #   If you use containers in a task with the `bridge` network mode, you
    #   can specify a non-reserved host port for your container port
    #   mapping, or you can omit the `hostPort` (or set it to `0`) while
    #   specifying a `containerPort` and your container automatically
    #   receives a port in the ephemeral port range for your container
    #   instance operating system and Docker version.
    #
    #   The default ephemeral port range for Docker version 1.6.0 and later
    #   is listed on the instance under
    #   `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range`. If this kernel parameter
    #   is unavailable, the default ephemeral port range from 49153 through
    #   65535 is used. Do not attempt to specify a host port in the
    #   ephemeral port range as these are reserved for automatic assignment.
    #   In general, ports below 32768 are outside of the ephemeral port
    #   range.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> The default ephemeral port range from 49153 through 65535 is always
    #   used for Docker versions before 1.6.0.

    #   The default reserved ports are 22 for SSH, the Docker ports 2375 and
    #   2376, and the Amazon ECS container agent ports 51678-51680. Any host
    #   port that was previously specified in a running task is also
    #   reserved while the task is running. That is, after a task stops, the

    #   required depending on the requirements of your task. For more

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] network_mode
    #   The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in the task.
    #   The valid values are `none`, `bridge`, `awsvpc`, and `host`. If no
    #   network mode is specified, the default is `bridge`.
    #
    #   For Amazon ECS tasks on Fargate, the `awsvpc` network mode is
    #   required. For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Linux instances, any
    #   network mode can be used. For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Windows
    #   instances, `<default>` or `awsvpc` can be used. If the network mode
    #   is set to `none`, you cannot specify port mappings in your container
    #   definitions, and the tasks containers do not have external
    #   connectivity. The `host` and `awsvpc` network modes offer the
    #   highest networking performance for containers because they use the
    #   EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided
    #   by the `bridge` mode.
    #
    #   With the `host` and `awsvpc` network modes, exposed container ports
    #   are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the `host`
    #   network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for
    #   the `awsvpc` network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic
    #   host port mappings.
    #
    #   When using the `host` network mode, you should not run containers
    #   using the root user (UID 0). It is considered best practice to use a
    #   non-root user.
    #
    #   If the network mode is `awsvpc`, the task is allocated an elastic
    #   network interface, and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration value
    #   when you create a service or run a task with the task definition.
    #   For more information, see [Task Networking][1] in the *Amazon
    #   Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   If the network mode is `host`, you cannot run multiple
    #   instantiations of the same task on a single container instance when
    #   port mappings are used.
    #
    #   For more information, see [Network settings][2] in the *Docker run
    #   reference*.

    #   runtime.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] requires_compatibilities
    #   The task launch type that Amazon ECS validates the task definition

    #   doesn't validate against the compatibilities specified. If no value
    #   is specified, the parameter is omitted from the response.

    # @!attribute [rw] cpu
    #   The number of CPU units used by the task. It can be expressed as an

    #   vCPUs (for example, `1 vCPU` or `1 vcpu`) in a task definition.
    #   String values are converted to an integer indicating the CPU units
    #   when the task definition is registered.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Task-level CPU and memory parameters are ignored for Windows
    #   containers. We recommend specifying container-level resources for
    #   Windows containers.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   If you're using the EC2 launch type, this field is optional.
    #   Supported values are between `128` CPU units (`0.125` vCPUs) and
    #   `10240` CPU units (`10` vCPUs).
    #
    #   If you're using the Fargate launch type, this field is required and
    #   you must use one of the following values, which determines your
    #   range of supported values for the `memory` parameter:
    #
    #   The CPU units cannot be less than 1 vCPU when you use Windows

    #
    #   * Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
    #
    #   * For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key
    #     can have only one value.
    #
    #   * Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
    #
    #   * Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
    #
    #   * If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and

    #   `host` IPC mode on the same container instance share the same IPC
    #   resources with the host Amazon EC2 instance. If `task` is specified,
    #   all containers within the specified task share the same IPC
    #   resources. If `none` is specified, then IPC resources within the
    #   containers of a task are private and not shared with other
    #   containers in a task or on the container instance. If no value is
    #   specified, then the IPC resource namespace sharing depends on the
    #   Docker daemon setting on the container instance. For more
    #   information, see [IPC settings][1] in the *Docker run reference*.
    #
    #   If the `host` IPC mode is used, be aware that there is a heightened
    #   risk of undesired IPC namespace expose. For more information, see
    #   [Docker security][2].
    #
    #   If you are setting namespaced kernel parameters using
    #   `systemControls` for the containers in the task, the following will
    #   apply to your IPC resource namespace. For more information, see
    #   [System Controls][3] in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service
    #   Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   * For tasks that use the `host` IPC mode, IPC namespace related
    #     `systemControls` are not supported.
    #
    #   * For tasks that use the `task` IPC mode, IPC namespace related
    #     `systemControls` will apply to all containers within a task.

    #   * Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination
    #     of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved
    #     for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or

    #     desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the
    #     service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can
    #     use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task
    #     placement decisions.
    #
    #   * `DAEMON`-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task
    #     on each active container instance. This taskmeets all of the task
    #     placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The
    #     service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints
    #     for running tasks. It stop tasks that don't meet the placement
    #     constraints.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Fargate tasks don't support the `DAEMON` scheduling strategy.

    # @!attribute [rw] network_mode
    #   The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in the task.
    #   The valid values are `none`, `bridge`, `awsvpc`, and `host`. If no
    #   network mode is specified, the default is `bridge`.
    #
    #   For Amazon ECS tasks on Fargate, the `awsvpc` network mode is
    #   required. For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Linux instances, any
    #   network mode can be used. For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Windows
    #   instances, `<default>` or `awsvpc` can be used. If the network mode
    #   is set to `none`, you cannot specify port mappings in your container
    #   definitions, and the tasks containers do not have external
    #   connectivity. The `host` and `awsvpc` network modes offer the
    #   highest networking performance for containers because they use the
    #   EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided
    #   by the `bridge` mode.
    #
    #   With the `host` and `awsvpc` network modes, exposed container ports
    #   are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the `host`
    #   network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for
    #   the `awsvpc` network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic
    #   host port mappings.
    #
    #   When using the `host` network mode, you should not run containers
    #   using the root user (UID 0). It is considered best practice to use a
    #   non-root user.
    #
    #   If the network mode is `awsvpc`, the task is allocated an elastic
    #   network interface, and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration value
    #   when you create a service or run a task with the task definition.
    #   For more information, see [Task Networking][1] in the *Amazon
    #   Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   If the network mode is `host`, you cannot run multiple
    #   instantiations of the same task on a single container instance when
    #   port mappings are used.

    #   Determines whether to force a new deployment of the service. By

    #   start a new deployment with no service definition changes. For
    #   example, you can update a service's tasks to use a newer Docker

    #   checks after a task has first started. This is only valid if your
    #   service is configured to use a load balancer. If your service's
    #   tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic Load Balancing
    #   health checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up to
    #   2,147,483,647 seconds. During that time, the Amazon ECS service
    #   scheduler ignores the Elastic Load Balancing health check status.
    #   This grace period can prevent the ECS service scheduler from marking
    #   tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come
    #   up.
