    #     of healthy instances as a percentage of the total number of
    #     instances in the deployment. If you specify FLEET\_PERCENT, at the
    #     start of the deployment, AWS CodeDeploy converts the percentage to
    #     the equivalent number of instance and rounds up fractional
    #     instances.
    #
    #   The value parameter takes an integer.

    #   CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime will return a minimum healthy instance
    #   type of MOST\_CONCURRENCY and a value of 1. This means a deployment
    #   to only one instance at a time. (You cannot set the type to
    #   MOST\_CONCURRENCY, only to HOST\_COUNT or FLEET\_PERCENT.) In
    #   addition, with CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime, AWS CodeDeploy will try
    #   to ensure that all instances but one are kept in a healthy state
    #   during the deployment. Although this allows one instance at a time
    #   to be taken offline for a new deployment, it also means that if the
    #   deployment to the last instance fails, the overall deployment still
    #   succeeds.
