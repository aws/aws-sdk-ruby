    #     deleted after the deployment is created, but before it is started.
    #
    #   * HEALTH\_CONSTRAINTS: The deployment failed on too many instances
    #     to be successfully deployed within the instance health constraints

    #   * OVER\_MAX\_INSTANCES: The maximum number of instances was
    #     exceeded.

    #   * THROTTLED: The operation was throttled because the calling account
    #     exceeded the throttling limits of one or more AWS services.
    #
    #   * TIMEOUT: The deployment has timed out.
    #
    #   * REVISION\_MISSING: The revision ID was missing. This error code is
