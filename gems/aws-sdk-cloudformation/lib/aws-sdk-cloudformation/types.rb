    # Structure that contains the results of the account gate function which
    # AWS CloudFormation invokes, if present, before proceeding with a stack
    # set operation in an account and region.
    #
    # For each account and region, AWS CloudFormation lets you specify a
    # Lamdba function that encapsulates any requirements that must be met
    # before CloudFormation can proceed with a stack set operation in that
    # account and region. CloudFormation invokes the function each time a
    # stack set operation is requested for that account and region; if the
    # function returns `FAILED`, CloudFormation cancels the operation in
    # that account and region, and sets the stack set operation result
    # status for that account and region to `FAILED`.

    #     operation to occur. AWS CloudFormation proceeds with the stack
    #     operation in that account and region.
    #
    #   * `FAILED`\: The account gate function has determined that the
    #     account and region does not meet the requirements for a stack set
    #     operation to occur. AWS CloudFormation cancels the stack set
    #     operation in that account and region, and sets the stack set
    #     operation result status for that account and region to `FAILED`.
    #
    #   * `SKIPPED`\: AWS CloudFormation has skipped calling the account
    #     gate function for this account and region, for one of the
    #     following reasons:
    #
    #     * An account gate function has not been specified for the account
    #       and region. AWS CloudFormation proceeds with the stack set

    #
    #     * The `AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole` of the stack set
    #       adminstration account lacks permissions to invoke the function.
    #       AWS CloudFormation proceeds with the stack set operation in this

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] role_arn
    #   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access
    #   Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to roll back
    #   the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make
    #   calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this role for
    #   all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission
    #   to operate on the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if
    #   the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role
    #   grants least privilege.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that
    #   was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available,
    #   AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from
    #   your user credentials.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] resources_to_skip
    #   A list of the logical IDs of the resources that AWS CloudFormation
    #   skips during the continue update rollback operation. You can specify
    #   only resources that are in the `UPDATE_FAILED` state because a
    #   rollback failed. You can't specify resources that are in the
    #   `UPDATE_FAILED` state for other reasons, for example, because an
    #   update was cancelled. To check why a resource update failed, use the
    #   DescribeStackResources action, and view the resource status reason.
    #
    #   Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that AWS
    #   CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. We recommend that you
    #   [ troubleshoot][1] resources before skipping them. AWS
    #   CloudFormation sets the status of the specified resources to
    #   `UPDATE_COMPLETE` and continues to roll back the stack. After the
    #   rollback is complete, the state of the skipped resources will be
    #   inconsistent with the state of the resources in the stack template.
    #   Before performing another stack update, you must update the stack or
    #   resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't,
    #   subsequent stack updates might fail, and the stack will become
    #   unrecoverable.
    #
    #   Specify the minimum number of resources required to successfully
    #   roll back your stack. For example, a failed resource update might
    #   cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it might not be
    #   necessary to skip the dependent resources.
    #
    #   To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the following
    #   format: `NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID`. If you want to specify
    #   the logical ID of a stack resource (`Type:
    #   AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`) in the `ResourcesToSkip` list, then its
    #   corresponding embedded stack must be in one of the following states:
    #   `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS`, `DELETE_COMPLETE`, or `DELETE_FAILED`.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Don't confuse a child stack's name with its corresponding logical
    #   ID defined in the parent stack. For an example of a continue update
    #   rollback operation with nested stacks, see [Using ResourcesToSkip to
    #   recover a nested stacks hierarchy][2].

    #   In some cases, you must explicity acknowledge that your stack

    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`
    #
    #     Some stack templates might include resources that can affect
    #     permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS
    #     Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you
    #     must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these
    #     capabilities.
    #
    #     The following IAM resources require you to specify either the
    #     `CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify
    #       `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`.
    #
    #     * If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS
    #       CloudFormation returns an `InsufficientCapabilities` error.
    #
    #     If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that
    #     you review all permissions associated with them and edit their
    #     permissions if necessary.

    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`
    #
    #     Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on
    #     templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace
    #     operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire
    #     templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set
    #     from the processed template, so that they can review the changes
    #     resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If
    #     your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to
    #     create a stack directly from the processed template, without first
    #     reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must
    #     acknowledge this capability. This includes the [AWS::Include][9]
    #     and [AWS::Serverless][10] transforms, which are macros hosted by
    #     AWS CloudFormation.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> This capacity does not apply to creating change sets, and
    #     specifying it when creating change sets has no effect.
    #
    #      Also, change sets do not currently support nested stacks. If you
    #     want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros
    #     *and* nested stacks, you must create or update the stack directly
    #     from the template using the CreateStack or UpdateStack action, and
    #     specifying this capability.

    # @!attribute [rw] capabilities
    #   In some cases, you must explicity acknowledge that your stack

    #   CloudFormation to create the stack.
    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`
    #
    #     Some stack templates might include resources that can affect
    #     permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS
    #     Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you
    #     must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these
    #     capabilities.
    #
    #     The following IAM resources require you to specify either the
    #     `CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify
    #       `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`.
    #
    #     * If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS
    #       CloudFormation returns an `InsufficientCapabilities` error.
    #
    #     If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that
    #     you review all permissions associated with them and edit their
    #     permissions if necessary.
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::AccessKey][1]

    #
    #     For more information, see [Acknowledging IAM Resources in AWS
    #     CloudFormation Templates][8].
    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`
    #
    #     Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on
    #     templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace
    #     operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire
    #     templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set
    #     from the processed template, so that they can review the changes
    #     resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If
    #     your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to
    #     create a stack directly from the processed template, without first
    #     reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must
    #     acknowledge this capability. This includes the [AWS::Include][9]
    #     and [AWS::Serverless][10] transforms, which are macros hosted by
    #     AWS CloudFormation.
    #
    #     Change sets do not currently support nested stacks. If you want to
    #     create a stack from a stack template that contains macros *and*
    #     nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from the
    #     template using this capability.
    #
    #     You should only create stacks directly from a stack template that
    #     contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs.
    #
    #      Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for
    #     processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function
    #     owner can update the function operation without AWS CloudFormation
    #     being notified.
    #
    #     For more information, see [Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to
    #     Perform Custom Processing on Templates][11].

    #   A list of stack set parameters whose values you want to override in

    #
    #   Any overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack
    #   instances in the specified accounts and regions. When specifying
    #   parameters and their values, be aware of how AWS CloudFormation sets
    #   parameter values during stack instance operations:
    #
    #   * To override the current value for a parameter, include the
    #     parameter and specify its value.
    #
    #   * To leave a parameter set to its present value, you can do one of
    #     the following:
    #
    #     * Do not include the parameter in the list.
    #
    #     * Include the parameter and specify `UsePreviousValue` as `true`.
    #       (You cannot specify both a value and set `UsePreviousValue` to
    #       `true`.)
    #
    #   * To set all overridden parameter back to the values specified in
    #     the stack set, specify a parameter list but do not include any
    #     parameters.
    #
    #   * To leave all parameters set to their present values, do not
    #     specify this property at all.
    #
    #   During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden for a
    #   stack instance are not updated, but retain their overridden value.
    #
    #   You can only override the parameter *values* that are specified in
    #   the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use
    #   [UpdateStackSet][1] to update the stack set template.

    # @!attribute [rw] capabilities
    #   In some cases, you must explicity acknowledge that your stack set
    #   template contains certain capabilities in order for AWS
    #   CloudFormation to create the stack set and related stack instances.
    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`
    #
    #     Some stack templates might include resources that can affect
    #     permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS
    #     Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stack sets,
    #     you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these
    #     capabilities.
    #
    #     The following IAM resources require you to specify either the
    #     `CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify
    #       `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`.
    #
    #     * If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS
    #       CloudFormation returns an `InsufficientCapabilities` error.
    #
    #     If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that
    #     you review all permissions associated with them and edit their
    #     permissions if necessary.
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::AccessKey][1]
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::Group][2]
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile][3]
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::Policy][4]
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::Role][5]
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::User][6]
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition][7]
    #
    #     For more information, see [Acknowledging IAM Resources in AWS
    #     CloudFormation Templates][8].
    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`
    #
    #     Some templates contain macros. If your stack template contains one
    #     or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the
    #     processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes
    #     in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. For more
    #     information, see [Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform
    #     Custom Processing on Templates][9].
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> Stack sets do not currently support macros in stack templates.
    #     (This includes the [AWS::Include][10] and [AWS::Serverless][11]
    #     transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation.) Even
    #     if you specify this capability, if you include a macro in your
    #     template the stack set operation will fail.

    #   value, so this is a `Static` evaluation.

    #   it depends on the result of an intrinsic function, such as a `Ref`
    #   or `Fn::GetAtt` intrinsic function, when the stack is updated. For
    #   example, if your template includes a reference to a resource that is
    #   conditionally recreated, the value of the reference (the physical ID

    #     get template parameter values, such as `\{ "Ref" :
    #     "MyPasswordParameter" \}`.
    #
    #   * `ResourceAttribute` entities are `Fn::GetAtt` intrinsic functions
    #     that get resource attribute values, such as `\{ "Fn::GetAtt" : [
    #     "MyEC2InstanceResource", "PublicDnsName" ] \}`.
    #
    #   * `DirectModification` entities are changes that are made directly
    #     to the template.
    #
    #   * `Automatic` entities are `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` resource
    #     types, which are also known as nested stacks. If you made no
    #     changes to the `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` resource, AWS
    #     CloudFormation sets the `ChangeSource` to `Automatic` because the
    #     nested stack's template might have changed. Changes to a nested
    #     stack's template aren't visible to AWS CloudFormation until you

    #   In some cases, you must explicity acknowledge that your stack
    #   template contains certain capabilities in order for AWS
    #   CloudFormation to update the stack.
    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`
    #
    #     Some stack templates might include resources that can affect
    #     permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS
    #     Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you
    #     must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these
    #     capabilities.
    #
    #     The following IAM resources require you to specify either the
    #     `CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify
    #       `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`.
    #
    #     * If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS
    #       CloudFormation returns an `InsufficientCapabilities` error.
    #
    #     If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that
    #     you review all permissions associated with them and edit their
    #     permissions if necessary.

    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`
    #
    #     Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on
    #     templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace
    #     operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire
    #     templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set
    #     from the processed template, so that they can review the changes
    #     resulting from the macros before actually updating the stack. If
    #     your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to
    #     update a stack directly from the processed template, without first
    #     reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must
    #     acknowledge this capability. This includes the [AWS::Include][9]
    #     and [AWS::Serverless][10] transforms, which are macros hosted by
    #     AWS CloudFormation.
    #
    #     Change sets do not currently support nested stacks. If you want to
    #     update a stack from a stack template that contains macros *and*
    #     nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from the
    #     template using this capability.
    #
    #     You should only update stacks directly from a stack template that
    #     contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs.
    #
    #      Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for
    #     processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function
    #     owner can update the function operation without AWS CloudFormation
    #     being notified.
    #
    #     For more information, see [Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to
    #     Perform Custom Processing on Templates][11].

    #   stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls
    #   on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this role for all
    #   future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to
    #   operate on the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the
    #   users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants
    #   least privilege.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that

    #
    #   You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect

    #   Location of a file containing the updated stack policy. The URL must
    #   point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the
    #   same region as the stack. You can specify either the
    #   `StackPolicyBody` or the `StackPolicyURL` parameter, but not both.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] tags
    #   Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. AWS CloudFormation
    #   also propagates these tags to supported resources in the stack. You
    #   can specify a maximum number of 50 tags.
    #

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] client_request_token
    #   A unique identifier for this `UpdateStack` request. Specify this
    #   token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows
    #   that you're not attempting to update a stack with the same name.
    #   You might retry `UpdateStack` requests to ensure that AWS
    #   CloudFormation successfully received them.
    #
    #   All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the
    #   same client request token, which you can use to track operations.
    #   For example, if you execute a `CreateStack` operation with the token
    #   `token1`, then all the `StackEvents` generated by that operation
    #   will have `ClientRequestToken` set as `token1`.
    #
    #   In the console, stack operations display the client request token on
    #   the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console
    #   use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID*, which helps you
    #   easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a
    #   stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same
    #   token in the following format:

    #   parameters and their values, be aware of how AWS CloudFormation sets
    #   parameter values during stack instance update operations:
    #
    #   * To override the current value for a parameter, include the
    #     parameter and specify its value.
    #
    #   * To leave a parameter set to its present value, you can do one of
    #     the following:
    #
    #     * Do not include the parameter in the list.
    #
    #     * Include the parameter and specify `UsePreviousValue` as `true`.
    #       (You cannot specify both a value and set `UsePreviousValue` to
    #       `true`.)
    #
    #   * To set all overridden parameter back to the values specified in
    #     the stack set, specify a parameter list but do not include any
    #     parameters.
    #
    #   * To leave all parameters set to their present values, do not
    #     specify this property at all.
    #
    #   During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden for a
    #   stack instance are not updated, but retain their overridden value.
    #
    #   You can only override the parameter *values* that are specified in
    #   the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use
    #   `UpdateStackSet` to update the stack set template. If you add a

    #     Some templates contain macros. If your stack template contains one
    #     or more macros, and you choose to update a stack directly from the
    #     processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes
    #     in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. For more
    #     information, see [Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform
    #     Custom Processing on Templates][9].
    #
    #     Stack sets do not currently support macros in stack templates.
    #     (This includes the [AWS::Include][10] and [AWS::Serverless][11]
    #     transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation.) Even
    #     if you specify this capability, if you include a macro in your
    #     template the stack set operation will fail.

    #   The key-value pairs to associate with this stack set and the stacks
    #   created from it. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to
    #   supported resources that are created in the stacks. You can specify
    #   a maximum number of 50 tags.
    #
    #   If you specify tags for this parameter, those tags replace any list
    #   of tags that are currently associated with this stack set. This
    #   means:
    #
    #   * If you don't specify this parameter, AWS CloudFormation doesn't
    #     modify the stack's tags.
    #
    #   * If you specify *any* tags using this parameter, you must specify
    #     *all* the tags that you want associated with this stack set, even
    #     tags you've specifed before (for example, when creating the stack
    #     set or during a previous update of the stack set.). Any tags that
    #     you don't include in the updated list of tags are removed from
    #     the stack set, and therefore from the stacks and resources as
    #     well.
    #
    #   * If you specify an empty value, AWS CloudFormation removes all
    #     currently associated tags.
    #
    #   If you specify new tags as part of an `UpdateStackSet` action, AWS
    #   CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required IAM permission
    #   to tag resources. If you omit tags that are currently associated
    #   with the stack set from the list of tags you specify, AWS
    #   CloudFormation assumes that you want to remove those tags from the
    #   stack set, and checks to see if you have permission to untag
    #   resources. If you don't have the necessary permission(s), the
    #   entire `UpdateStackSet` action fails with an `access denied` error,
    #   and the stack set is not updated.

    #
    #   Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized administrator
    #   roles to control which users or groups can manage specific stack

    #   The name of the IAM execution role to use to update the stack set.

    #   `AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole` role for the stack set
    #   operation.
    #
    #   Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized execution roles
    #   to control which stack resources users and groups can include in
    #   their stack sets.
    #
    #   If you specify a customized execution role, AWS CloudFormation uses
    #   that role to update the stack. If you do not specify a customized
    #   execution role, AWS CloudFormation performs the update using the
    #   role previously associated with the stack set, so long as you have
    #   permissions to perform operations on the stack set.

    #   even if you retry the request multiple times. You might retry stack
    #   set operation requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation
    #   successfully received them.
    #
    #   If you don't specify an operation ID, AWS CloudFormation generates
    #   one automatically.
    #
    #   Repeating this stack set operation with a new operation ID retries
