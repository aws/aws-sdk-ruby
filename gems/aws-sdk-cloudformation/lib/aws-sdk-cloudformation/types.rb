    # Structure that contains the results of the account gate function which
    # CloudFormation invokes, if present, before proceeding with a stack set
    # operation in an account and Region.
    #
    # For each account and Region, CloudFormation lets you specify a Lambda
    # function that encapsulates any requirements that must be met before
    # CloudFormation can proceed with a stack set operation in that account
    # and Region. CloudFormation invokes the function each time a stack set
    # operation is requested for that account and Region; if the function
    # returns `FAILED`, CloudFormation cancels the operation in that account
    # and Region, and sets the stack set operation result status for that
    # account and Region to `FAILED`.
    #
    # For more information, see [Configuring a target account gate][1].

    #   The status of the account gate function.
    #
    #   * `SUCCEEDED`\: The account gate function has determined that the
    #     account and Region passes any requirements for a stack set
    #     operation to occur. CloudFormation proceeds with the stack
    #     operation in that account and Region.
    #
    #   * `FAILED`\: The account gate function has determined that the
    #     account and Region doesn't meet the requirements for a stack set
    #     operation to occur. CloudFormation cancels the stack set operation
    #     in that account and Region, and sets the stack set operation
    #     result status for that account and Region to `FAILED`.
    #
    #   * `SKIPPED`\: CloudFormation has skipped calling the account gate
    #     function for this account and Region, for one of the following
    #     reasons:
    #
    #     * An account gate function hasn't been specified for the account
    #       and Region. CloudFormation proceeds with the stack set operation
    #       in this account and Region.
    #
    #     * The `AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole` of the stack set
    #       administration account lacks permissions to invoke the function.
    #       CloudFormation proceeds with the stack set operation in this
    #       account and Region.
    #
    #     * Either no action is necessary, or no action is possible, on the
    #       stack. CloudFormation skips the stack set operation in this
    #       account and Region.

    #   CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your
    #   behalf. CloudFormation always uses this role for all future
    #   operations on the stack. Provided that users have permission to
    #   operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the
    #   users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants
    #   least permission.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was
    #   previously associated with the stack. If no role is available,
    #   CloudFormation uses a temporary session that's generated from your
    #   user credentials.
    #   @return [String]

    # @!attribute [rw] resources_to_skip
    #   A list of the logical IDs of the resources that CloudFormation skips
    #   during the continue update rollback operation. You can specify only
    #   resources that are in the `UPDATE_FAILED` state because a rollback
    #   failed. You can't specify resources that are in the `UPDATE_FAILED`
    #   state for other reasons, for example, because an update was
    #   canceled. To check why a resource update failed, use the
    #   DescribeStackResources action, and view the resource status reason.
    #
    #   Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that
    #   CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. We recommend that you
    #   [ troubleshoot][1] resources before skipping them. CloudFormation
    #   sets the status of the specified resources to `UPDATE_COMPLETE` and
    #   continues to roll back the stack. After the rollback is complete,
    #   the state of the skipped resources will be inconsistent with the
    #   state of the resources in the stack template. Before performing
    #   another stack update, you must update the stack or resources to be
    #   consistent with each other. If you don't, subsequent stack updates
    #   might fail, and the stack will become unrecoverable.
    #
    #   Specify the minimum number of resources required to successfully
    #   roll back your stack. For example, a failed resource update might
    #   cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it might not be
    #   necessary to skip the dependent resources.
    #
    #   To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the following
    #   format: `NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID`. If you want to specify
    #   the logical ID of a stack resource (`Type:
    #   AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`) in the `ResourcesToSkip` list, then its
    #   corresponding embedded stack must be in one of the following states:
    #   `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS`, `DELETE_COMPLETE`, or `DELETE_FAILED`.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Don't confuse a child stack's name with its corresponding logical
    #   ID defined in the parent stack. For an example of a continue update
    #   rollback operation with nested stacks, see [Using ResourcesToSkip to

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] capabilities
    #   In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack

    #   to create the stack.
    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`
    #
    #     Some stack templates might include resources that can affect
    #     permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by
    #     creating new Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those
    #     stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of
    #     these capabilities.
    #
    #     The following IAM resources require you to specify either the
    #     `CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify
    #       `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`.
    #
    #     * If you don't specify either of these capabilities,
    #       CloudFormation returns an `InsufficientCapabilities` error.
    #
    #     If your stack template contains these resources, we suggest that
    #     you review all permissions associated with them and edit their
    #     permissions if necessary.

    #     CloudFormation templates][8].
    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`
    #
    #     Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on
    #     templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace
    #     operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire
    #     templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set
    #     from the processed template, so that they can review the changes
    #     resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If
    #     your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to
    #     create a stack directly from the processed template, without first
    #     reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must
    #     acknowledge this capability. This includes the [AWS::Include][9]
    #     and [AWS::Serverless][10] transforms, which are macros hosted by
    #     CloudFormation.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> This capacity doesn't apply to creating change sets, and
    #     specifying it when creating change sets has no effect.
    #
    #      If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains
    #     macros *and* nested stacks, you must create or update the stack
    #     directly from the template using the CreateStack or UpdateStack
    #     action, and specifying this capability.
    #

    # @!attribute [rw] capabilities
    #   In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack
    #   template contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation
    #   to create the stack.
    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`
    #
    #     Some stack templates might include resources that can affect
    #     permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by
    #     creating new Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those
    #     stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of
    #     these capabilities.
    #
    #     The following IAM resources require you to specify either the
    #     `CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify
    #       `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`.
    #
    #     * If you don't specify either of these capabilities,
    #       CloudFormation returns an `InsufficientCapabilities` error.
    #
    #     If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that
    #     you review all permissions associated with them and edit their
    #     permissions if necessary.
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::AccessKey][1]
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::Group][2]

    #
    #     For more information, see [Acknowledging IAM Resources in
    #     CloudFormation Templates][8].
    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`
    #
    #     Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on
    #     templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace
    #     operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire
    #     templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set
    #     from the processed template, so that they can review the changes
    #     resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If
    #     your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to
    #     create a stack directly from the processed template, without first
    #     reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must
    #     acknowledge this capability. This includes the [AWS::Include][9]
    #     and [AWS::Serverless][10] transforms, which are macros hosted by
    #     CloudFormation.
    #
    #     If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains
    #     macros *and* nested stacks, you must create the stack directly
    #     from the template using this capability.
    #
    #     You should only create stacks directly from a stack template that
    #     contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs.
    #
    #      Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for
    #     processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function
    #     owner can update the function operation without CloudFormation
    #     being notified.
    #
    #     For more information, see [Using CloudFormation macros to perform
    #     custom processing on templates][11].

    # @!attribute [rw] resource_types
    #   The template resource types that you have permissions to work with
    #   for this create stack action, such as `AWS::EC2::Instance`,
    #   `AWS::EC2::*`, or `Custom::MyCustomInstance`. Use the following
    #   syntax to describe template resource types: `AWS::*` (for all Amazon
    #   Web Services resources), `Custom::*` (for all custom resources),
    #   `Custom::logical_ID ` (for a specific custom resource),
    #   `AWS::service_name::*` (for all resources of a particular Amazon Web
    #   Services service), and `AWS::service_name::resource_logical_ID `
    #   (for a specific Amazon Web Services resource).
    #
    #   If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that
    #   you're creating, the stack creation fails. By default,
    #   CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. Identity
    #   and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for
    #   CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more
    #   information, see [Controlling Access with Identity and Access
    #   Management][1].

    # @!attribute [rw] role_arn
    #   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management
    #   (IAM) role that CloudFormation assumes to create the stack.
    #   CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your
    #   behalf. CloudFormation always uses this role for all future
    #   operations on the stack. Provided that users have permission to
    #   operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the
    #   users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants
    #   least privilege.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was
    #   previously associated with the stack. If no role is available,
    #   CloudFormation uses a temporary session that's generated from your
    #   user credentials.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] on_failure
    #   Determines what action will be taken if stack creation fails. This

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] tags
    #   Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. CloudFormation also

    #   You might retry `CreateStack` requests to ensure that CloudFormation
    #   successfully received them.
    #
    #   All events initiated by a given stack operation are assigned the

    #   For example, if you execute a `CreateStack` operation with the token
    #   `token1`, then all the `StackEvents` generated by that operation
    #   will have `ClientRequestToken` set as `token1`.
    #
    #   In the console, stack operations display the client request token on
    #   the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console
    #   use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID*, which helps you
    #   easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a
    #   stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same
    #   token in the following format:
    #   `Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`.

    #   When specifying parameters and their values, be aware of how

    #   operations:
    #
    #   * To override the current value for a parameter, include the

    #   * To leave an overridden parameter set to its present value, include
    #     the parameter and specify `UsePreviousValue` as `true`. (You

    # @!attribute [rw] capabilities
    #   In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack set
    #   template contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation
    #   to create the stack set and related stack instances.
    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`
    #
    #     Some stack templates might include resources that can affect
    #     permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by
    #     creating new Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those
    #     stack sets, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one
    #     of these capabilities.
    #
    #     The following IAM resources require you to specify either the
    #     `CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify
    #       `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`.
    #
    #     * If you don't specify either of these capabilities,
    #       CloudFormation returns an `InsufficientCapabilities` error.
    #
    #     If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that
    #     you review all permissions associated with them and edit their
    #     permissions if necessary.
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::AccessKey][1]
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::Group][2]
    #
    #     * [AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile][3]
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::Policy][4]
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::Role][5]
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::User][6]
    #
    #     * [AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition][7]
    #
    #     For more information, see [Acknowledging IAM Resources in
    #     CloudFormation Templates][8].
    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`
    #
    #     Some templates reference macros. If your stack set template
    #     references one or more macros, you must create the stack set
    #     directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the
    #     resulting changes in a change set. To create the stack set
    #     directly, you must acknowledge this capability. For more
    #     information, see [Using CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom
    #     Processing on Templates][9].
    #
    #     Stack sets with service-managed permissions don't currently
    #     support the use of macros in templates. (This includes the
    #     [AWS::Include][10] and [AWS::Serverless][11] transforms, which are
    #     macros hosted by CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this
    #     capability for a stack set with service-managed permissions, if
    #     you reference a macro in your template the stack set operation
    #     will fail.

    #
    #   * `ResourceAttribute` entities are `Fn::GetAtt` intrinsic functions
    #     that get resource attribute values, such as `\{ "Fn::GetAtt" : [
    #     "MyEC2InstanceResource", "PublicDnsName" ] \}`.
    #
    #   * `DirectModification` entities are changes that are made directly
    #     to the template.
    #
    #   * `Automatic` entities are `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` resource
    #     types, which are also known as nested stacks. If you made no
    #     changes to the `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` resource,
    #     CloudFormation sets the `ChangeSource` to `Automatic` because the
    #     nested stack's template might have changed. Changes to a nested

    #   triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of
    #   triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:
    #
    #   * To use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack,
    #     if any, don't specify this parameter.
    #
    #   * To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify

    #     triggers you've specified before (for example, when creating the
    #     stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you
    #     don't include in the updated list of triggers are no longer
    #     applied to the stack.
    #
    #   * To remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list
    #     for this parameter.

    #   operation deploys all necessary resources.
    #
    #   The default is 0 minutes.
    #
    #   If you specify a monitoring period but don't specify any rollback
    #   triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time
    #   before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can
    #   use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation
    #   desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using
    #   [CancelUpdateStack][1], for example) as necessary.
    #
    #   If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors
    #   the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update
    #   operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old

    # @!attribute [rw] capabilities
    #   In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack

    #   to update the stack.
    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`
    #
    #     Some stack templates might include resources that can affect
    #     permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by
    #     creating new Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those
    #     stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of
    #     these capabilities.
    #
    #     The following IAM resources require you to specify either the
    #     `CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify
    #       `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`.
    #
    #     * If you don't specify either of these capabilities,
    #       CloudFormation returns an `InsufficientCapabilities` error.
    #
    #     If your stack template contains these resources, we suggest that
    #     you review all permissions associated with them and edit their
    #     permissions if necessary.
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::AccessKey][1]
    #
    #     * [ AWS::IAM::Group][2]

    #     For more information, see [Acknowledging IAM Resources in
    #     CloudFormation Templates][8].
    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`
    #
    #     Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on
    #     templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace
    #     operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire
    #     templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set
    #     from the processed template, so that they can review the changes
    #     resulting from the macros before actually updating the stack. If
    #     your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to
    #     update a stack directly from the processed template, without first
    #     reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must
    #     acknowledge this capability. This includes the [AWS::Include][9]
    #     and [AWS::Serverless][10] transforms, which are macros hosted by
    #     CloudFormation.
    #
    #     If you want to update a stack from a stack template that contains
    #     macros *and* nested stacks, you must update the stack directly
    #     from the template using this capability.
    #
    #     You should only update stacks directly from a stack template that
    #     contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs.
    #
    #      Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for
    #     processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function
    #     owner can update the function operation without CloudFormation
    #     being notified.
    #
    #     For more information, see [Using CloudFormation Macros to Perform
    #     Custom Processing on Templates][11].

    #   You might retry `UpdateStack` requests to ensure that CloudFormation
    #   successfully received them.
    #
    #   All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the
    #   same client request token, which you can use to track operations.
    #   For example, if you execute a `CreateStack` operation with the token
    #   `token1`, then all the `StackEvents` generated by that operation
    #   will have `ClientRequestToken` set as `token1`.
    #
    #   In the console, stack operations display the client request token on
    #   the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console
    #   use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID*, which helps you
    #   easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a
    #   stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same
    #   token in the following format:
    #   `Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`.

    #   Any overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack
    #   instances in the specified accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions.
    #   When specifying parameters and their values, be aware of how
    #   CloudFormation sets parameter values during stack instance update
    #   operations:
    #
    #   * To override the current value for a parameter, include the
    #     parameter and specify its value.
    #
    #   * To leave an overridden parameter set to its present value, include
    #     the parameter and specify `UsePreviousValue` as `true`. (You
    #     can't specify both a value and set `UsePreviousValue` to `true`.)
    #
    #   * To set an overridden parameter back to the value specified in the
    #     stack set, specify a parameter list but don't include the
    #     parameter in the list.
    #
    #   * To leave all parameters set to their present values, don't
    #     specify this property at all.
    #
    #   During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden for a
    #   stack instance aren't updated, but retain their overridden value.
    #
    #   You can only override the parameter *values* that are specified in
    #   the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use
    #   `UpdateStackSet` to update the stack set template. If you add a
    #   parameter to a template, before you can override the parameter value
    #   specified in the stack set you must first use [UpdateStackSet][1] to
    #   update all stack instances with the updated template and parameter
    #   value specified in the stack set. Once a stack instance has been
    #   updated with the new parameter, you can then override the parameter
    #   value using `UpdateStackInstances`.

    #   In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack

    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`
    #
    #     Some stack templates might include resources that can affect
    #     permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by
    #     creating new Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those
    #     stacks sets, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying
    #     one of these capabilities.
    #
    #     The following IAM resources require you to specify either the
    #     `CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.
    #
    #     * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify
    #       `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`.
    #
    #     * If you don't specify either of these capabilities,
    #       CloudFormation returns an `InsufficientCapabilities` error.
    #
    #     If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that
    #     you review all permissions associated with them and edit their
    #     permissions if necessary.

    #
    #   * `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`
    #
    #     Some templates reference macros. If your stack set template
    #     references one or more macros, you must update the stack set
    #     directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the
    #     resulting changes in a change set. To update the stack set
    #     directly, you must acknowledge this capability. For more
    #     information, see [Using CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom
    #     Processing on Templates][9].
    #
    #     Stack sets with service-managed permissions do not currently
    #     support the use of macros in templates. (This includes the
    #     [AWS::Include][10] and [AWS::Serverless][11] transforms, which are
    #     macros hosted by CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this
    #     capability for a stack set with service-managed permissions, if
    #     you reference a macro in your template the stack set operation
    #     will fail.

    # @!attribute [rw] execution_role_name
    #   The name of the IAM execution role to use to update the stack set.
    #   If you do not specify an execution role, CloudFormation uses the
    #   `AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole` role for the stack set
    #   operation.
    #
    #   Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized execution roles
    #   to control which stack resources users and groups can include in
    #   their stack sets.
    #
    #   If you specify a customized execution role, CloudFormation uses that
    #   role to update the stack. If you do not specify a customized
    #   execution role, CloudFormation performs the update using the role
    #   previously associated with the stack set, so long as you have
    #   permissions to perform operations on the stack set.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] deployment_targets
    #   \[Service-managed permissions\] The Organizations accounts in which
    #   to update associated stack instances.
    #
    #   To update all the stack instances associated with this stack set, do
    #   not specify `DeploymentTargets` or `Regions`.
    #
    #   If the stack set update includes changes to the template (that is,
    #   if `TemplateBody` or `TemplateURL` is specified), or the
    #   `Parameters`, CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a status
    #   of `OUTDATED` prior to updating the stack instances in the specified
    #   accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions. If the stack set update
    #   doesn't include changes to the template or parameters,
    #   CloudFormation updates the stack instances in the specified accounts
    #   and Regions, while leaving all other stack instances with their
    #   existing stack instance status.
    #   @return [Types::DeploymentTargets]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] permission_model
    #   Describes how the IAM roles required for stack set operations are
    #   created. You cannot modify `PermissionModel` if there are stack
    #   instances associated with your stack set.
    #
    #   * With `self-managed` permissions, you must create the administrator
    #     and execution roles required to deploy to target accounts. For
    #     more information, see [Grant Self-Managed Stack Set
    #     Permissions][1].
    #
    #   * With `service-managed` permissions, StackSets automatically
    #     creates the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by
    #     Organizations. For more information, see [Grant Service-Managed
    #     Stack Set Permissions][2].

    #   \[Service-managed permissions\] Describes whether StackSets
    #   automatically deploys to Organizations accounts that are added to a
    #   target organization or organizational unit (OU).
    #
    #   If you specify `AutoDeployment`, don't specify `DeploymentTargets`
    #   or `Regions`.
    #   @return [Types::AutoDeployment]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] operation_id
    #   The unique ID for this stack set operation.
    #
    #   The operation ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure
    #   that CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even
    #   if you retry the request multiple times. You might retry stack set
    #   operation requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully
    #   received them.
    #
    #   If you don't specify an operation ID, CloudFormation generates one
    #   automatically.
    #
    #   Repeating this stack set operation with a new operation ID retries
    #   all stack instances whose status is `OUTDATED`.
    #
    #   **A suitable default value is auto-generated.** You should normally
    #   not need to pass this option.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] accounts
    #   \[Self-managed permissions\] The accounts in which to update
    #   associated stack instances. If you specify accounts, you must also
    #   specify the Amazon Web Services Regions in which to update stack set
    #   instances.
    #
    #   To update *all* the stack instances associated with this stack set,
    #   don't specify the `Accounts` or `Regions` properties.
    #
    #   If the stack set update includes changes to the template (that is,
    #   if the `TemplateBody` or `TemplateURL` properties are specified), or
    #   the `Parameters` property, CloudFormation marks all stack instances
    #   with a status of `OUTDATED` prior to updating the stack instances in
    #   the specified accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions. If the stack
    #   set update does not include changes to the template or parameters,
    #   CloudFormation updates the stack instances in the specified accounts
    #   and Amazon Web Services Regions, while leaving all other stack
    #   instances with their existing stack instance status.
    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] regions
    #   The Amazon Web Services Regions in which to update associated stack
    #   instances. If you specify Regions, you must also specify accounts in
    #   which to update stack set instances.
    #
    #   To update *all* the stack instances associated with this stack set,
    #   do not specify the `Accounts` or `Regions` properties.

    # @!attribute [rw] call_as
    #   \[Service-managed permissions\] Specifies whether you are acting as
    #   an account administrator in the organization's management account
    #   or as a delegated administrator in a member account.
    #
    #   By default, `SELF` is specified. Use `SELF` for stack sets with
    #   self-managed permissions.
    #
    #   * If you are signed in to the management account, specify `SELF`.
    #
    #   * If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
    #     `DELEGATED_ADMIN`.
    #
    #     Your Amazon Web Services account must be registered as a delegated
    #     administrator in the management account. For more information, see
