Feature: Smoke tests for Firehose

Background:
  Given I create a client in region 'us-west-2'

  @firehose @smoke
  Scenario: Call Aws::Firehose::Client#list_delivery_streams and expect it to succeed
  When I call the operation 'list_delivery_streams' with params:
    """
{}
    """
  Then I expect an error was not raised

  @firehose @smoke
  Scenario: Call Aws::Aws::Firehose::Client#describe_delivery_stream and expect it to fail
  When I call the operation 'describe_delivery_stream' with params:
    """
{"delivery_stream_name":"bogus-stream-name"}
    """
  Then I expect an error was raised
