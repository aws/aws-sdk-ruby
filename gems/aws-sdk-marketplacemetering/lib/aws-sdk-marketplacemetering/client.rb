    # @overload initialize(options)
    #   @param [Hash] options
    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2 IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts are
    #       very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #       `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` to enable retries and extended
    #       timeouts.
    #
    #   @option options [required, String] :region
    #     The AWS region to connect to.  The configured `:region` is
    #     used to determine the service `:endpoint`. When not passed,
    #     a default `:region` is search for in the following locations:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:region]`
    #     * `ENV['AWS_REGION']`
    #     * `ENV['AMAZON_REGION']`

    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :client_side_monitoring_port (31000)
    #     Required for publishing client metrics. The port that the client side monitoring

    #
    #   @option options [Aws::ClientSideMonitoring::Publisher] :client_side_monitoring_publisher (Aws::ClientSideMonitoring::Publisher)
    #     Allows you to provide a custom client-side monitoring publisher class. By default,
    #     will use the Client Side Monitoring Agent Publisher.

    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :endpoint_cache_max_entries (1000)
    #     Used for the maximum size limit of the LRU cache storing endpoints data

    #   @option options [Integer] :endpoint_cache_poll_interval (60)
    #     When :endpoint_discovery and :active_endpoint_cache is enabled,
    #     Use this option to config the time interval in seconds for making
    #     requests fetching endpoints information. Defaults to 60 sec.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :endpoint_discovery (false)
    #     When set to `true`, endpoint discovery will be enabled for operations when available. Defaults to `false`.

    #     is not set, logging will be disabled.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :profile ("default")
    #     Used when loading credentials from the shared credentials file
    #     at HOME/.aws/credentials.  When not specified, 'default' is used.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :retry_base_delay (0.3)
    #     The base delay in seconds used by the default backoff function.
    #
    #   @option options [Symbol] :retry_jitter (:none)

    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_limit (3)
    #     The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #     ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #     are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #     checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors and auth

    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_max_delay (0)

    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :simple_json (false)
    #     Disables request parameter conversion, validation, and formatting.
    #     Also disable response data type conversions. This option is useful
    #     when you want to ensure the highest level of performance by
    #     avoiding overhead of walking request parameters and response data
    #     structures.
    #
    #     When `:simple_json` is enabled, the request parameters hash must
    #     be formatted exactly as the DynamoDB API expects.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #     Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #     fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #     the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #     {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #     ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #     requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #     When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #     sending the request.

    #     number of seconds to wait for response data.  This value can
    #     safely be set
    #     per-request on the session yeidled by {#session_for}.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_idle_timeout (5) The number of
    #     seconds a connection is allowed to sit idble before it is
    #     considered stale.  Stale connections are closed and removed
    #     from the pool before making a request.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_continue_timeout (1) The number of
    #     seconds to wait for a 100-continue response before sending the
    #     request body.  This option has no effect unless the request has
    #     "Expect" header set to "100-continue".  Defaults to `nil` which
    #     disables this behaviour.  This value can safely be set per
    #     request on the session yeidled by {#session_for}.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :http_wire_trace (false) When `true`,
    #     HTTP debug output will be sent to the `:logger`.

    #     SSL peer certificates are verified when establishing a
    #     connection.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_bundle Full path to the SSL

    #     will be used if available.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :ssl_ca_directory Full path of the
    #     directory that contains the unbundled SSL certificate
    #     authority files for verifying peer certificates.  If you do

    # Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must
    # integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the
    # RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering. Free
    # and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to
    # call RegisterUsage, but you may choose to do so if you would like to
    # receive usage data in your seller reports. The sections below explain
    # the behavior of RegisterUsage. RegisterUsage performs two primary
    # functions: metering and entitlement.
    #
    # * *Entitlement*\: RegisterUsage allows you to verify that the customer
    #   running your paid software is subscribed to your product on AWS
    #   Marketplace, enabling you to guard against unauthorized use. Your
    #   container image that integrates with RegisterUsage is only required
    #   to guard against unauthorized use at container startup, as such a
    #   CustomerNotSubscribedException/PlatformNotSupportedException will
    #   only be thrown on the initial call to RegisterUsage. Subsequent
    #   calls from the same Amazon ECS task instance (e.g. task-id) or
    #   Amazon EKS pod will not throw a CustomerNotSubscribedException, even
    #   if the customer unsubscribes while the Amazon ECS task or Amazon EKS
    #   pod is still running.
    #
    # * *Metering*\: RegisterUsage meters software use per ECS task, per
    #   hour, or per pod for Amazon EKS with usage prorated to the second. A
    #   minimum of 1 minute of usage applies to tasks that are short lived.
    #   For example, if a customer has a 10 node Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS
    #   cluster and a service configured as a Daemon Set, then Amazon ECS or
    #   Amazon EKS will launch a task on all 10 cluster nodes and the
    #   customer will be charged: (10 * hourly\_rate). Metering for
    #   software use is automatically handled by the AWS Marketplace
    #   Metering Control Plane -- your software is not required to perform
    #   any metering specific actions, other than call RegisterUsage once
    #   for metering of software use to commence. The AWS Marketplace
    #   Metering Control Plane will also continue to bill customers for
    #   running ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods, regardless of the customers
    #   subscription state, removing the need for your software to perform
    #   entitlement checks at runtime.
