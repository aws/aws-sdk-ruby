    # @!attribute [rw] resolve_conflicts
    #   How to resolve field value conflicts for an Amazon EKS add-on.
    #   Conflicts are handled based on the value you choose:
    #
    #   * **None** – If the self-managed version of the add-on is installed
    #     on your cluster, Amazon EKS doesn't change the value. Creation of
    #     the add-on might fail.
    #
    #   * **Overwrite** – If the self-managed version of the add-on is
    #     installed on your cluster and the Amazon EKS default value is
    #     different than the existing value, Amazon EKS changes the value to
    #     the Amazon EKS default value.
    #
    #   * **Preserve** – This is similar to the NONE option. If the
    #     self-managed version of the add-on is installed on your cluster
    #     Amazon EKS doesn't change the add-on resource properties.
    #     Creation of the add-on might fail if conflicts are detected. This
    #     option works differently during the update operation. For more
    #     information, see [UpdateAddon][1].
    #
    #   If you don't currently have the self-managed version of the add-on
    #   installed on your cluster, the Amazon EKS add-on is installed.
    #   Amazon EKS sets all values to default values, regardless of the
    #   option that you specify.

    #
    #   * **AccessDenied**: Amazon EKS or one or more of your managed nodes
    #     is failing to authenticate or authorize with your Kubernetes
    #     cluster API server.
    #
    #   * **AsgInstanceLaunchFailures**: Your Auto Scaling group is
    #     experiencing failures while attempting to launch instances.
    #
    #   * **AutoScalingGroupNotFound**: We couldn't find the Auto Scaling
    #     group associated with the managed node group. You may be able to
    #     recreate an Auto Scaling group with the same settings to recover.
    #
    #   * **ClusterUnreachable**: Amazon EKS or one or more of your managed
    #     nodes is unable to to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster API
    #     server. This can happen if there are network disruptions or if API
    #     servers are timing out processing requests.
    #
    #   * **Ec2LaunchTemplateNotFound**: We couldn't find the Amazon EC2
    #     launch template for your managed node group. You may be able to
    #     recreate a launch template with the same settings to recover.
    #
    #   * **Ec2LaunchTemplateVersionMismatch**: The Amazon EC2 launch
    #     template version for your managed node group does not match the
    #     version that Amazon EKS created. You may be able to revert to the
    #     version that Amazon EKS created to recover.
    #
    #   * **Ec2SecurityGroupDeletionFailure**: We could not delete the
    #     remote access security group for your managed node group. Remove
    #     any dependencies from the security group.
    #
    #   * **Ec2SecurityGroupNotFound**: We couldn't find the cluster
    #     security group for the cluster. You must recreate your cluster.
    #
    #   * **Ec2SubnetInvalidConfiguration**: One or more Amazon EC2 subnets
    #     specified for a node group do not automatically assign public IP
    #     addresses to instances launched into it. If you want your
    #     instances to be assigned a public IP address, then you need to
    #     enable the `auto-assign public IP address` setting for the subnet.
    #     See [Modifying the public `IPv4` addressing attribute for your
    #     subnet][1] in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.
    #
    #   * **IamInstanceProfileNotFound**: We couldn't find the IAM instance
    #     profile for your managed node group. You may be able to recreate
    #     an instance profile with the same settings to recover.
    #
    #   * **IamNodeRoleNotFound**: We couldn't find the IAM role for your
    #     managed node group. You may be able to recreate an IAM role with
    #     the same settings to recover.
    #
    #   * **InstanceLimitExceeded**: Your Amazon Web Services account is
    #     unable to launch any more instances of the specified instance
    #     type. You may be able to request an Amazon EC2 instance limit
    #     increase to recover.
    #
    #   * **InsufficientFreeAddresses**: One or more of the subnets
    #     associated with your managed node group does not have enough
    #     available IP addresses for new nodes.
    #
    #   * **InternalFailure**: These errors are usually caused by an Amazon
    #     EKS server-side issue.
    #
    #   * **NodeCreationFailure**: Your launched instances are unable to
    #     register with your Amazon EKS cluster. Common causes of this
    #     failure are insufficient [node IAM role][2] permissions or lack of
    #     outbound internet access for the nodes.

    #   Whenever this parameter changes, the number of worker nodes in the

    #   worker nodes, the necessary number of worker nodes are terminated to

    #   if you remove this parameter from your CFN template.

    #   This parameter can be different from `minSize` in some cases, such
    #   as when starting with extra hosts for testing. This parameter can
    #   also be different when you want to start with an estimated number of
    #   needed hosts, but let the Cluster Autoscaler reduce the number if
    #   there are too many. When the Cluster Autoscaler is used, the
    #   `desiredSize` parameter is altered by the Cluster Autoscaler (but
    #   can be out-of-date for short periods of time). the Cluster
    #   Autoscaler doesn't scale a managed node group lower than `minSize`
    #   or higher than `maxSize`.
