    # @!attribute [rw] virtual_interface_state
    #   The state of the virtual interface. The following are the possible
    #   values:
    #
    #   * `confirming`\: The creation of the virtual interface is pending
    #     confirmation from the virtual interface owner. If the owner of the
    #     virtual interface is different from the owner of the connection on
    #     which it is provisioned, then the virtual interface will remain in
    #     this state until it is confirmed by the virtual interface owner.
    #
    #   * `verifying`\: This state only applies to public virtual
    #     interfaces. Each public virtual interface needs validation before
    #     the virtual interface can be created.
    #
    #   * `pending`\: A virtual interface is in this state from the time
    #     that it is created until the virtual interface is ready to forward
    #     traffic.
    #
    #   * `available`\: A virtual interface that is able to forward traffic.
    #
    #   * `down`\: A virtual interface that is BGP down.
    #
    #   * `deleting`\: A virtual interface is in this state immediately
    #     after calling DeleteVirtualInterface until it can no longer
    #     forward traffic.
    #
    #   * `deleted`\: A virtual interface that cannot forward traffic.
    #
    #   * `rejected`\: The virtual interface owner has declined creation of
    #     the virtual interface. If a virtual interface in the `Confirming`
    #     state is deleted by the virtual interface owner, the virtual
    #     interface enters the `Rejected` state.
    #
    #   * `unknown`\: The state of the virtual interface is not available.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] customer_router_config
    #   The customer router configuration.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] mtu
    #   The maximum transmission unit (MTU), in bytes. The supported values
    #   are 1500 and 9001. The default value is 1500.

    #   Indicates whether jumbo frames (9001 MTU) are supported.

    #   The ID of the virtual private gateway. Applies only to private
    #   virtual interfaces.

    #   The ID of the Direct Connect gateway.

    #   The routes to be advertised to the AWS network in this Region.
    #   Applies to public virtual interfaces.
    #   @return [Array<Types::RouteFilterPrefix>]

    # @!attribute [rw] bgp_peers
    #   The BGP peers configured on this virtual interface.
    #   @return [Array<Types::BGPPeer>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] region
    #   The AWS Region where the virtual interface is located.
    #   @return [String]
