    # uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to logically
    # aggregate a bundle of physical connections. Like an interconnect, it
    # can host other connections. All connections in a LAG must terminate on
    # the same physical AWS Direct Connect endpoint, and must be the same
    # bandwidth.
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] connections_bandwidth
    #   The individual bandwidth of the physical connections bundled by the
    #   LAG.
    #
    #   Available values: 1Gbps, 10Gbps
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] number_of_connections
    #   The number of physical connections bundled by the LAG, up to a
    #   maximum of 10.
    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] lag_id
    #   The ID of the LAG.
    #
    #   Example: dxlag-fg5678gh
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] owner_account
    #   The owner of the LAG.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] lag_name
    #   The name of the LAG.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] lag_state
    #   The state of the LAG.
    #
    #   * **Requested**\: The initial state of a LAG. The LAG stays in the
    #     requested state until the Letter of Authorization (LOA) is
    #     available.
    #
    #   * **Pending**\: The LAG has been approved, and is being initialized.
    #
    #   * **Available**\: The network link is established, and the LAG is
    #     ready for use.
    #
    #   * **Down**\: The network link is down.
    #
    #   * **Deleting**\: The LAG is in the process of being deleted.
    #
    #   * **Deleted**\: The LAG has been deleted.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] location
    #   Where the connection is located.

    #   Example: EqSV5

    #   Default: None
    #   @return [String]

    #
    #   Default: None
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] minimum_links
    #   The minimum number of physical connections that must be operational
    #   for the LAG itself to be operational. If the number of operational
    #   connections drops below this setting, the LAG state changes to
    #   `down`. This value can help to ensure that a LAG is not overutilized
    #   if a significant number of its bundled connections go down.
    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] aws_device
    #   The AWS Direct Connection endpoint that hosts the LAG.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] connections
    #   A list of connections bundled by this LAG.
