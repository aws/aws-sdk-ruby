# This module provides support for IAM Roles Anywhere. This module is available in the
# `aws-sdk-rolesanywhere` gem.

# # Client
#
# The {Client} class provides one method for each API operation. Operation
# methods each accept a hash of request parameters and return a response
# structure.

#     resp = roles_anywhere.create_profile(params)
#
# See {Client} for more information.
#
# # Errors
#
# Errors returned from IAM Roles Anywhere are defined in the
# {Errors} module and all extend {Errors::ServiceError}.
