    # @!attribute [rw] bot_alias
    #   Alias of the Amazon Lex bot.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] user_id
    #   ID of the client application user. Typically, each of your
    #   application users should have a unique ID. The application developer
    #   decides the user IDs. At runtime, each request must include the user
    #   ID. Note the following considerations:
    #
    #   * If you want a user to start conversation on one device and
    #     continue the conversation on another device, you might choose a
    #     user-specific identifier, such as the user's login, or Amazon
    #     Cognito user ID (assuming your application is using Amazon
    #     Cognito).
    #
    #   * If you want the same user to be able to have two independent
    #     conversations on two different devices, you might choose
    #     device-specific identifier, such as device ID, or some globally
    #     unique identifier.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] session_attributes
    #   You pass this value in the `x-amz-lex-session-attributes` HTTP
    #   header. The value must be map (keys and values must be strings) that
    #   is JSON serialized and then base64 encoded.
    #
    #   A session represents dialog between a user and Amazon Lex. At
    #   runtime, a client application can pass contextual information, in
    #   the request to Amazon Lex. For example,
    #
    #   * You might use session attributes to track the requestID of user
    #     requests.
    #
    #   * In Getting Started Exercise 1, the example bot uses the price
    #     session attribute to maintain the price of flowers ordered (for
    #     example, "price":25). The code hook (Lambda function) sets this
    #     attribute based on the type of flowers ordered. For more
    #     information, see [Review the Details of Information Flow][1].
    #
    #   * In the BookTrip bot exercise, the bot uses the
    #     `currentReservation` session attribute to maintains the slot data
    #     during the in-progress conversation to book a hotel or book a car.
    #     For more information, see [Details of Information Flow][2].
    #
    #   Amazon Lex passes these session attributes to the Lambda functions
    #   configured for the intent In the your Lambda function, you can use
    #   the session attributes for initialization and customization
    #   (prompts). Some examples are:
    #
    #   * Initialization - In a pizza ordering bot, if you pass user
    #     location (for example, `"Location : 111 Maple Street"`), then your
    #     Lambda function might use this information to determine the
    #     closest pizzeria to place the order (and perhaps set the
    #     storeAddress slot value as well).
    #
    #     Personalized prompts - For example, you can configure prompts to
    #     refer to the user by name (for example, "Hey \[firstName\], what
    #     toppings would you like?"). You can pass the user's name as a
    #     session attribute ("firstName": "Joe") so that Amazon Lex can
    #     substitute the placeholder to provide a personalized prompt to the
    #     user ("Hey Joe, what toppings would you like?").
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Amazon Lex does not persist session attributes.
    #
    #    If you configured a code hook for the intent, Amazon Lex passes the
    #   incoming session attributes to the Lambda function. The Lambda
    #   function must return these session attributes if you want Amazon Lex
    #   to return them to the client.
    #
    #    If there is no code hook configured for the intent Amazon Lex simply
    #   returns the session attributes to the client application.

    # @!attribute [rw] content_type
    #   You pass this values as the `Content-Type` HTTP header.
    #
    #   Indicates the audio format or text. The header value must start with
    #   one of the following prefixes:
    #
    #   * PCM format

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] accept
    #   You pass this value as the `Accept` HTTP header.
    #
    #   The message Amazon Lex returns in the response can be either text or
    #   speech based on the `Accept` HTTP header value in the request.
    #
    #   * If the value is `text/plain; charset=utf-8`, Amazon Lex returns
    #     text in the response.
    #
    #   * If the value begins with `audio/`, Amazon Lex returns speech in
    #     the response. Amazon Lex uses Amazon Polly to generate the speech
    #     (using the configuration you specified in the `Accept` header).
    #     For example, if you specify `audio/mpeg` as the value, Amazon Lex
    #     returns speech in the MPEG format.
    #
    #     The following are the accepted values:
    #
    #     * audio/mpeg
    #
    #     * audio/ogg
    #
    #     * audio/pcm

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] session_attributes
    #   Map of key/value pairs representing the session-specific context
    #   information.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] message
    #   Message to convey to the user. It can come from the bot's
    #   configuration or a code hook (Lambda function). If the current
    #   intent is not configured with a code hook or if the code hook
    #   returned `Delegate` as the `dialogAction.type` in its response, then
    #   Amazon Lex decides the next course of action and selects an
    #   appropriate message from the bot configuration based on the current
    #   user interaction context. For example, if Amazon Lex is not able to
    #   understand the user input, it uses a clarification prompt message
    #   (For more information, see the Error Handling section in the Amazon
    #   Lex console). Another example: if the intent requires confirmation
    #   before fulfillment, then Amazon Lex uses the confirmation prompt
    #   message in the intent configuration. If the code hook returns a
    #   message, Amazon Lex passes it as-is in its response to the client.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] dialog_state
    #   Identifies the current state of the user interaction. Amazon Lex
    #   returns one of the following values as `dialogState`. The client can
    #   optionally use this information to customize the user interface.
    #
    #   * `ElicitIntent` – Amazon Lex wants to elicit the user's intent.
    #     Consider the following examples:
    #
    #     For example, a user might utter an intent ("I want to order a
    #     pizza"). If Amazon Lex cannot infer the user intent from this
    #     utterance, it will return this dialog state.
    #
    #   * `ConfirmIntent` – Amazon Lex is expecting a "yes" or "no"
    #     response.
    #
    #     For example, Amazon Lex wants user confirmation before fulfilling
    #     an intent. Instead of a simple "yes" or "no" response, a user
    #     might respond with additional information. For example, "yes, but
    #     make it a thick crust pizza" or "no, I want to order a drink."
    #     Amazon Lex can process such additional information (in these
    #     examples, update the crust type slot or change the intent from
    #     OrderPizza to OrderDrink).
    #
    #   * `ElicitSlot` – Amazon Lex is expecting the value of a slot for the
    #     current intent.
    #
    #     For example, suppose that in the response Amazon Lex sends this
    #     message: "What size pizza would you like?". A user might reply
    #     with the slot value (e.g., "medium"). The user might also
    #     provide additional information in the response (e.g., "medium
    #     thick crust pizza"). Amazon Lex can process such additional
    #     information appropriately.
    #
    #   * `Fulfilled` – Conveys that the Lambda function has successfully
    #     fulfilled the intent.
    #
    #   * `ReadyForFulfillment` – Conveys that the client has to fullfill
    #     the request.
    #
    #   * `Failed` – Conveys that the conversation with the user failed.
    #
    #     This can happen for various reasons, including that the user does
    #     not provide an appropriate response to prompts from the service
    #     (you can configure how many times Amazon Lex can prompt a user for
    #     specific information), or if the Lambda function fails to fulfill
    #     the intent.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] slot_to_elicit
    #   If the `dialogState` value is `ElicitSlot`, returns the name of the
    #   slot for which Amazon Lex is eliciting a value.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] input_transcript
    #   Transcript of the voice input to the operation.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] audio_stream
    #   The prompt (or statement) to convey to the user. This is based on
    #   the bot configuration and context. For example, if Amazon Lex did
    #   not understand the user intent, it sends the `clarificationPrompt`
    #   configured for the bot. If the intent requires confirmation before
    #   taking the fulfillment action, it sends the `confirmationPrompt`.
    #   Another example: Suppose that the Lambda function successfully
    #   fulfilled the intent, and sent a message to convey to the user. Then
    #   Amazon Lex sends that message in the response.

    #   The ID of the client application user. The application developer

    #   ID. Typically, each of your application users should have a unique
    #   ID. Note the following considerations:

    #   * If you want a user to start a conversation on one device and
    #     continue the conversation on another device, you might choose a
    #     user-specific identifier, such as a login or Amazon Cognito user
    #     ID (assuming your application is using Amazon Cognito).
    #
    #   * If you want the same user to be able to have two independent
    #     conversations on two different devices, you might choose a
    #     device-specific identifier, such as device ID, or some globally
    #     unique identifier.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] session_attributes
    #   By using session attributes, a client application can pass
    #   contextual information in the request to Amazon Lex For example,
    #
    #   * In Getting Started Exercise 1, the example bot uses the `price`
    #     session attribute to maintain the price of the flowers ordered
    #     (for example, "Price":25). The code hook (the Lambda function)
    #     sets this attribute based on the type of flowers ordered. For more
    #     information, see [Review the Details of Information Flow][1].
    #
    #   * In the BookTrip bot exercise, the bot uses the
    #     `currentReservation` session attribute to maintain slot data
    #     during the in-progress conversation to book a hotel or book a car.
    #     For more information, see [Details of Information Flow][2].
    #
    #   * You might use the session attributes (key, value pairs) to track
    #     the requestID of user requests.
    #
    #   Amazon Lex simply passes these session attributes to the Lambda
    #   functions configured for the intent.
    #
    #   In your Lambda function, you can also use the session attributes for
    #   initialization and customization (prompts and response cards). Some
    #   examples are:
    #
    #   * Initialization - In a pizza ordering bot, if you can pass the user
    #     location as a session attribute (for example, `"Location" : "111
    #     Maple street"`), then your Lambda function might use this

    #     (perhaps to set the storeAddress slot value).
    #
    #   * Personalize prompts - For example, you can configure prompts to
    #     refer to the user name. (For example, "Hey \[FirstName\], what
    #     toppings would you like?"). You can pass the user name as a
