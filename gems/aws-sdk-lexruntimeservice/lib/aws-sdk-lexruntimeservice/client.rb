    # @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #   Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #   following classes:
    #
    #   * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #     credentials.
    #
    #   * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #     from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #   * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #     shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #   * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #   When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #   locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #   * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #   * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #   * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #   * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #   * `~/.aws/config`
    #   * EC2 IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts are
    #     very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #     `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` to enable retries and extended
    #     timeouts.
    #
    # @option options [required, String] :region
    #   The AWS region to connect to.  The configured `:region` is
    #   used to determine the service `:endpoint`. When not passed,
    #   a default `:region` is search for in the following locations:
    #
    #   * `Aws.config[:region]`
    #   * `ENV['AWS_REGION']`
    #   * `ENV['AMAZON_REGION']`
    #   * `ENV['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION']`
    #   * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #   * `~/.aws/config`
    #
    # @option options [String] :access_key_id
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :convert_params (true)
    #   When `true`, an attempt is made to coerce request parameters into
    #   the required types.
    #
    # @option options [String] :endpoint
    #   The client endpoint is normally constructed from the `:region`
    #   option. You should only configure an `:endpoint` when connecting
    #   to test endpoints. This should be avalid HTTP(S) URI.
    #
    # @option options [Aws::Log::Formatter] :log_formatter (Aws::Log::Formatter.default)
    #   The log formatter.
    #
    # @option options [Symbol] :log_level (:info)
    #   The log level to send messages to the `:logger` at.
    #
    # @option options [Logger] :logger
    #   The Logger instance to send log messages to.  If this option
    #   is not set, logging will be disabled.
    #
    # @option options [String] :profile ("default")
    #   Used when loading credentials from the shared credentials file
    #   at HOME/.aws/credentials.  When not specified, 'default' is used.
    #
    # @option options [Integer] :retry_limit (3)
    #   The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #   ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #   are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #   checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors and auth
    #   errors from expired credentials.
    #
    # @option options [String] :secret_access_key
    #
    # @option options [String] :session_token
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #   Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #   fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #   the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #   {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #   ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #   requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #   When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #   sending the request.

    # @!group API Operations

    # Sends user input (text or speech) to Amazon Lex. Clients use this API
    # to send requests to Amazon Lex at runtime. Amazon Lex interprets the
    # user input using the machine learning model that it built for the bot.
    #
    # In response, Amazon Lex returns the next message to convey to the
    # user. Consider the following example messages:
    #
    # * For a user input "I would like a pizza," Amazon Lex might return a
    #   response with a message eliciting slot data (for example,
    #   `PizzaSize`): "What size pizza would you like?".
    #
    # * After the user provides all of the pizza order information, Amazon
    #   Lex might return a response with a message to get user confirmation:
    #   "Order the pizza?".
    #
    # * After the user replies "Yes" to the confirmation prompt, Amazon
    #   Lex might return a conclusion statement: "Thank you, your cheese
    #   pizza has been ordered.".
    #
    # Not all Amazon Lex messages require a response from the user. For
    # example, conclusion statements do not require a response. Some
    # messages require only a yes or no response. In addition to the
    # `message`, Amazon Lex provides additional context about the message in
    # the response that you can use to enhance client behavior, such as
    # displaying the appropriate client user interface. Consider the
    # following examples:
    #
    # * If the message is to elicit slot data, Amazon Lex returns the
    #   following context information:
    #
    #   * `x-amz-lex-dialog-state` header set to `ElicitSlot`
    #
    #   * `x-amz-lex-intent-name` header set to the intent name in the
    #     current context
    #
    #   * `x-amz-lex-slot-to-elicit` header set to the slot name for which
    #     the `message` is eliciting information
    #
    #   * `x-amz-lex-slots` header set to a map of slots configured for the
    #     intent with their current values
    #
    # * If the message is a confirmation prompt, the
    #   `x-amz-lex-dialog-state` header is set to `Confirmation` and the
    #   `x-amz-lex-slot-to-elicit` header is omitted.
    #
    # * If the message is a clarification prompt configured for the intent,
    #   indicating that the user intent is not understood, the
    #   `x-amz-dialog-state` header is set to `ElicitIntent` and the
    #   `x-amz-slot-to-elicit` header is omitted.
    #
    # In addition, Amazon Lex also returns your application-specific
    # `sessionAttributes`. For more information, see [Managing Conversation
    # Context][1].

    #
    # @option params [required, String] :bot_name
    #   Name of the Amazon Lex bot.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :bot_alias
    #   Alias of the Amazon Lex bot.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :user_id
    #   ID of the client application user. Typically, each of your application
    #   users should have a unique ID. The application developer decides the
    #   user IDs. At runtime, each request must include the user ID. Note the
    #   following considerations:
    #
    #   * If you want a user to start conversation on one device and continue
    #     the conversation on another device, you might choose a user-specific
    #     identifier, such as the user's login, or Amazon Cognito user ID
    #     (assuming your application is using Amazon Cognito).
    #
    #   * If you want the same user to be able to have two independent
    #     conversations on two different devices, you might choose
    #     device-specific identifier, such as device ID, or some globally
    #     unique identifier.
    #
    # @option params [String] :session_attributes
    #   You pass this value in the `x-amz-lex-session-attributes` HTTP header.
    #   The value must be map (keys and values must be strings) that is JSON
    #   serialized and then base64 encoded.
    #
    #   A session represents dialog between a user and Amazon Lex. At runtime,
    #   a client application can pass contextual information, in the request
    #   to Amazon Lex. For example,
    #
    #   * You might use session attributes to track the requestID of user
    #     requests.
    #
    #   * In Getting Started Exercise 1, the example bot uses the price
    #     session attribute to maintain the price of flowers ordered (for
    #     example, "price":25). The code hook (Lambda function) sets this
    #     attribute based on the type of flowers ordered. For more
    #     information, see [Review the Details of Information Flow][1].
    #
    #   * In the BookTrip bot exercise, the bot uses the `currentReservation`
    #     session attribute to maintains the slot data during the in-progress
    #     conversation to book a hotel or book a car. For more information,
    #     see [Details of Information Flow][2].
    #
    #   Amazon Lex passes these session attributes to the Lambda functions
    #   configured for the intent In the your Lambda function, you can use the
    #   session attributes for initialization and customization (prompts).
    #   Some examples are:
    #
    #   * Initialization - In a pizza ordering bot, if you pass user location
    #     (for example, `"Location : 111 Maple Street"`), then your Lambda
    #     function might use this information to determine the closest
    #     pizzeria to place the order (and perhaps set the storeAddress slot
    #     value as well).
    #
    #     Personalized prompts - For example, you can configure prompts to
    #     refer to the user by name (for example, "Hey \[firstName\], what
    #     toppings would you like?"). You can pass the user's name as a
    #     session attribute ("firstName": "Joe") so that Amazon Lex can
    #     substitute the placeholder to provide a personalized prompt to the
    #     user ("Hey Joe, what toppings would you like?").
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Amazon Lex does not persist session attributes.
    #
    #    If you configured a code hook for the intent, Amazon Lex passes the
    #   incoming session attributes to the Lambda function. The Lambda
    #   function must return these session attributes if you want Amazon Lex
    #   to return them to the client.
    #
    #    If there is no code hook configured for the intent Amazon Lex simply
    #   returns the session attributes to the client application.

    # @option params [required, String] :content_type
    #   You pass this values as the `Content-Type` HTTP header.
    #
    #   Indicates the audio format or text. The header value must start with
    #   one of the following prefixes:
    #
    #   * PCM format
    #
    #     * audio/l16; rate=16000; channels=1
    #
    #     * audio/x-l16; sample-rate=16000; channel-count=1
    #
    #   * Opus format
    #
    #     * audio/x-cbr-opus-with-preamble; preamble-size=0; bit-rate=1;
    #       frame-size-milliseconds=1.1
    #
    #     ^
    #
    #   * Text format
    #
    #     * text/plain; charset=utf-8
    #
    #     ^
    #
    # @option params [String] :accept
    #   You pass this value as the `Accept` HTTP header.
    #
    #   The message Amazon Lex returns in the response can be either text or
    #   speech based on the `Accept` HTTP header value in the request.
    #
    #   * If the value is `text/plain; charset=utf-8`, Amazon Lex returns text
    #     in the response.
    #
    #   * If the value begins with `audio/`, Amazon Lex returns speech in the
    #     response. Amazon Lex uses Amazon Polly to generate the speech (using
    #     the configuration you specified in the `Accept` header). For
    #     example, if you specify `audio/mpeg` as the value, Amazon Lex
    #     returns speech in the MPEG format.
    #
    #     The following are the accepted values:
    #
    #     * audio/mpeg
    #
    #     * audio/ogg
    #
    #     * audio/pcm
    #

    #
    # * After the user replies to a confirmation prompt with a "yes",
    #   Amazon Lex might return a conclusion statement: "Thank you, your

    #
    # Not all Amazon Lex messages require a user response. For example, a

    #
    # * If the message is to elicit slot data, Amazon Lex returns the
    #   following context information:
    #
    #   * `dialogState` set to ElicitSlot
    #
    #   * `intentName` set to the intent name in the current context
    #
    #   * `slotToElicit` set to the slot name for which the `message` is
