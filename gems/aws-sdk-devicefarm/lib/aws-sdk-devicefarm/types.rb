    #       OS\_VERSION, MODEL, MANUFACTURER, and INSTANCE\_ARN attributes.
    #
    #     * The LESS\_THAN, GREATER\_THAN, LESS\_THAN\_OR\_EQUALS, and
    #       GREATER\_THAN\_OR\_EQUALS operators are also available for the
    #       OS\_VERSION attribute.
    #
    #   * Values: An array of one or more filter values.
    #
    #     * The IN and NOT\_IN operators take a values array that has one or
    #       more elements.
    #
    #     * The other operators require an array with a single element.
    #
    #     * In a request, the AVAILABILITY attribute takes the following
