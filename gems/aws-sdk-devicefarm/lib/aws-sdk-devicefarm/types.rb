    #   For Calabash tests:
    #
    #   * profile: A cucumber profile, for example, "my\_profile\_name".
    #
    #   * tags: You can limit execution to features or scenarios that have
    #     (or don't have) certain tags, for example, "@smoke" or
    #     "@smoke,~@wip".
    #
    #   For Appium tests (all types):
    #
    #   * appium\_version: The Appium version. Currently supported values
    #     are "1.4.16", "1.6.3", "latest", and "default".
    #
    #     * “latest” will run the latest Appium version supported by Device
    #       Farm (1.6.3).
    #
    #     * For “default”, Device Farm will choose a compatible version of
    #       Appium for the device. The current behavior is to run 1.4.16 on
    #       Android devices and iOS 9 and earlier, 1.6.3 for iOS 10 and
    #       later.
    #
    #     * This behavior is subject to change.
    #
    #   For Fuzz tests (Android only):
    #
    #   * event\_count: The number of events, between 1 and 10000, that the
    #     UI fuzz test should perform.
    #
    #   * throttle: The time, in ms, between 0 and 1000, that the UI fuzz
    #     test should wait between events.
    #
    #   * seed: A seed to use for randomizing the UI fuzz test. Using the
    #     same seed value between tests ensures identical event sequences.
    #
    #   For Explorer tests:
    #
    #   * username: A username to use if the Explorer encounters a login
    #     form. If not supplied, no username will be inserted.
    #
    #   * password: A password to use if the Explorer encounters a login
    #     form. If not supplied, no password will be inserted.
    #
    #   For Instrumentation:
    #
    #   * filter: A test filter string. Examples:
    #
    #     * Running a single test case: "com.android.abc.Test1"
    #
    #     * Running a single test: "com.android.abc.Test1#smoke"
    #
    #     * Running multiple tests:
    #       "com.android.abc.Test1,com.android.abc.Test2"
    #
    #   For XCTest and XCTestUI:
    #
    #   * filter: A test filter string. Examples:
    #
    #     * Running a single test class: "LoginTests"
    #
    #     * Running a multiple test classes: "LoginTests,SmokeTests"
    #
    #     * Running a single test: "LoginTests/testValid"
    #
    #     * Running multiple tests:
    #       "LoginTests/testValid,LoginTests/testInvalid"
    #
    #   For UIAutomator:
    #
    #   * filter: A test filter string. Examples:
    #
    #     * Running a single test case: "com.android.abc.Test1"
    #
    #     * Running a single test: "com.android.abc.Test1#smoke"
