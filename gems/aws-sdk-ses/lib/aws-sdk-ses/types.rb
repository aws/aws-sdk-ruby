    #

    #     `arn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT-ID-WITHOUT-HYPHENS:alias/aws/ses`. For
    #     example, if your AWS account ID is 123456789012 and you want to
    #     use the default master key in the US West (Oregon) region, the ARN
    #     of the default master key would be
    #     `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:alias/aws/ses`. If you use the
    #     default master key, you don't need to perform any extra steps to
    #     give Amazon SES permission to use the key.
    #
    #   * To use a custom master key you created in AWS KMS, provide the ARN
    #     of the master key and ensure that you add a statement to your
    #     key's policy to give Amazon SES permission to use it. For more
    #     information about giving permissions, see the [Amazon SES
    #     Developer Guide][1].
    #
    #   For more information about key policies, see the [AWS KMS Developer
    #   Guide][2]. If you do not specify a master key, Amazon SES will not
    #   encrypt your emails.
    #
    #   Your mail is encrypted by Amazon SES using the Amazon S3 encryption
    #   client before the mail is submitted to Amazon S3 for storage. It is
    #   not encrypted using Amazon S3 server-side encryption. This means
    #   that you must use the Amazon S3 encryption client to decrypt the
    #   email after retrieving it from Amazon S3, as the service has no
    #   access to use your AWS KMS keys for decryption. This encryption
    #   client is currently available with the [AWS SDK for Java][3] and
    #   [AWS SDK for Ruby][4] only. For more information about client-side
    #   encryption using AWS KMS master keys, see the [Amazon S3 Developer

    #   <note markdown="1"> Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described

    #   The sender name (also known as the *friendly name*) may contain
    #   non-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME
    #   encoded-word syntax, as described in [RFC 2047][4]. MIME
    #   encoded-word syntax uses the following form:
    #   `=?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=`.

    #

    #   * Each part of a multipart MIME message must be formatted properly.

    #   * Attachments must be of a content type that Amazon SES supports.
    #     For a list on unsupported content types, see [Unsupported
    #     Attachment Types][1] in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   * The entire message must be base64-encoded.
    #
    #   * If any of the MIME parts in your message contain content that is
    #     outside of the 7-bit ASCII character range, we highly recommend

    #   For example, if the owner of `example.com` (which has ARN
