module Aws::SES
  # This class provides a resource oriented interface for SES.
  # To create a resource object:
  #     resource = Aws::SES::Resource.new(region: 'us-west-2')
  # You can supply a client object with custom configuration that will be used for all resource operations.
  # If you do not pass +:client+, a default client will be constructed.
  #     client = Aws::SES::Client.new(region: 'us-west-2')
  #     resource = Aws::SES::Resource.new(client: client)

    end

    # @return [Client]
