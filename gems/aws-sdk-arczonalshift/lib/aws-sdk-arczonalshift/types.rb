    # @!attribute [rw] applied_status
    #   The `appliedStatus` field specifies which application traffic shift
    #   is in effect for a resource when there is more than one traffic
    #   shift active. There can be more than one application traffic shift
    #   in progress at the same time - that is, practice run zonal shifts,
    #   customer-started zonal shifts, or an autoshift. The `appliedStatus`
    #   field for an autoshift for a resource can have one of two values:
    #   `APPLIED` or `NOT_APPLIED`. The zonal shift or autoshift that is
    #   currently in effect for the resource has an applied status set to
    #   `APPLIED`.
    #
    #   The overall principle for precedence is that zonal shifts that you
    #   start as a customer take precedence autoshifts, which take
    #   precedence over practice runs. That is, customer-started zonal
    #   shifts &gt; autoshifts &gt; practice run zonal shifts.
    #

    # Route 53 ARC for a managed resource to temporarily move traffic for
    # the resource away from an Availability Zone in an Amazon Web Services
    # Region. You can also configure zonal autoshift for a managed resource.

    #   following values can be returned:
    #
    #   * **PENDING:** Outcome value when a practice run is in progress.
    #
    #   * **SUCCEEDED:** Outcome value when the outcome alarm specified for
    #     the practice run configuration does not go into an `ALARM` state
    #     during the practice run, and the practice run was not interrupted
    #     before it completed the expected 30 minute zonal shift.
    #
    #   * **INTERRUPTED:** Outcome value when the practice run was stopped
    #     before the expected 30 minute zonal shift duration, or there was
    #     another problem with the practice run that created an inconclusive
    #     outcome.
    #
    #   * **FAILED:** Outcome value when the outcome alarm specified for the
    #     practice run configuration goes into an `ALARM` state during the
    #     practice run, and the practice run was not interrupted before it
    #     completed.

    #
    # Zonal shifts are temporary, including customer-started zonal shifts
    # and the zonal autoshift practice run zonal shifts that Route 53 ARC
    # starts weekly, on your behalf. A zonal shift that a customer starts
    # can be active for up to three days (72 hours). A practice run zonal
    # shift has a 30 minute duration.

    # @!attribute [rw] away_from
    #   The Availability Zone that traffic is moved away from for a resource
    #   when you start a zonal shift. Until the zonal shift expires or you
    #   cancel it, traffic for the resource is instead moved to other
    #   Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] expiry_time
    #   The expiry time (expiration time) for a customer-started zonal
    #   shift. A zonal shift is temporary and must be set to expire when you
    #   start the zonal shift. You can initially set a zonal shift to expire
    #   in a maximum of three days (72 hours). However, you can update a
    #   zonal shift to set a new expiration at any time.
    #
    #   When you start a zonal shift, you specify how long you want it to be
    #   active, which Route 53 ARC converts to an expiry time (expiration
    #   time). You can cancel a zonal shift when you're ready to restore
    #   traffic to the Availability Zone, or just wait for it to expire. Or
    #   you can update the zonal shift to specify another length of time to
    #   expire in.
    #   @return [Time]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] practice_run_outcome
    #   The outcome, or end state, of a practice run. The following values
    #   can be returned:
    #
    #   * **PENDING:** Outcome value when the practice run is in progress.
    #
    #   * **SUCCEEDED:** Outcome value when the outcome alarm specified for

    #     during the practice run, and the practice run was not interrupted
    #     before it completed.
    #
    #   * **INTERRUPTED:** Outcome value when the practice run did not run
    #     for the expected 30 minutes or there was another problem with the
    #     practice run that created an inconclusive outcome.
    #
    #   * **FAILED:** Outcome value when the outcome alarm specified for the

    #     practice run, and the practice run was not interrupted before it
    #     completed.
