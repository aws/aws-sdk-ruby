    #   @param [Hash] options
    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2 IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts are
    #       very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #       `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` to enable retries and extended
    #       timeouts.
    #
    #   @option options [required, String] :region

    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:region]`
    #     * `ENV['AWS_REGION']`
    #     * `ENV['AMAZON_REGION']`
    #     * `ENV['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION']`

    #     checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors, auth errors,
    #     endpoint discovery, and errors from expired credentials.
    #     This option is only used in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_max_delay (0)
    #     The maximum number of seconds to delay between retries (0 for no limit)
    #     used by the default backoff function. This option is only used in the

    #       no retry mode is provided.
    #
    #     * `standard` - A standardized set of retry rules across the AWS SDKs.
    #       This includes support for retry quotas, which limit the number of
    #       unsuccessful retries a client can make.
    #
    #     * `adaptive` - An experimental retry mode that includes all the
    #       functionality of `standard` mode along with automatic client side
    #       throttling.  This is a provisional mode that may change behavior

    #     number of seconds to wait for response data.  This value can
    #     safely be set per-request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_idle_timeout (5) The number of

    # http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/what-is.html
    #
    # @option params [Types::AccelerationSettings] :acceleration_settings
    #   Optional. Accelerated transcoding can significantly speed up jobs with
    #   long, visually complex content. Outputs that use this feature incur
    #   pro-tier pricing. For information about feature limitations, see the
    #   AWS Elemental MediaConvert User Guide.
    #
    # @option params [String] :billing_tags_source
    #   Optional. Choose a tag type that AWS Billing and Cost Management will
    #   use to sort your AWS Elemental MediaConvert costs on any billing
    #   report that you set up. Any transcoding outputs that don't have an
    #   associated tag will appear in your billing report unsorted. If you
    #   don't choose a valid value for this field, your job outputs will
    #   appear on the billing report unsorted.
    #
    # @option params [String] :client_request_token
    #   Optional. Idempotency token for CreateJob operation.**A suitable default value is auto-generated.** You should normally
    #   not need to pass this option.**
    #
    # @option params [Array<Types::HopDestination>] :hop_destinations
    #   Optional. Use queue hopping to avoid overly long waits in the backlog
    #   of the queue that you submit your job to. Specify an alternate queue
    #   and the maximum time that your job will wait in the initial queue
    #   before hopping. For more information about this feature, see the AWS
    #   Elemental MediaConvert User Guide.
    #
    # @option params [String] :job_template
    #   Optional. When you create a job, you can either specify a job template
    #   or specify the transcoding settings individually.
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :priority
    #   Optional. Specify the relative priority for this job. In any given
    #   queue, the service begins processing the job with the highest value
    #   first. When more than one job has the same priority, the service
    #   begins processing the job that you submitted first. If you don't
    #   specify a priority, the service uses the default value 0.
    #
    # @option params [String] :queue
    #   Optional. When you create a job, you can specify a queue to send it
    #   to. If you don't specify, the job will go to the default queue. For
    #   more about queues, see the User Guide topic at
    #   http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/what-is.html.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :role
    #   Required. The IAM role you use for creating this job. For details
    #   about permissions, see the User Guide topic at the User Guide at

    #
    # @option params [required, Types::JobSettings] :settings
    #   JobSettings contains all the transcode settings for a job.
    #
    # @option params [String] :simulate_reserved_queue
    #   Optional. Enable this setting when you run a test job to estimate how
    #   many reserved transcoding slots (RTS) you need. When this is enabled,
    #   MediaConvert runs your job from an on-demand queue with similar
    #   performance to what you will see with one RTS in a reserved queue.
    #   This setting is disabled by default.
    #
    # @option params [String] :status_update_interval
    #   Optional. Specify how often MediaConvert sends STATUS\_UPDATE events
    #   to Amazon CloudWatch Events. Set the interval, in seconds, between
    #   status updates. MediaConvert sends an update at this interval from the
    #   time the service begins processing your job to the time it completes
    #   the transcode or encounters an error.
    #
    # @option params [Hash<String,String>] :tags
    #   Optional. The tags that you want to add to the resource. You can tag
    #   resources with a key-value pair or with only a key.
    #
    # @option params [Hash<String,String>] :user_metadata
    #   Optional. User-defined metadata that you want to associate with an
    #   MediaConvert job. You specify metadata in key/value pairs.

    # @option params [Types::AccelerationSettings] :acceleration_settings
    #   Accelerated transcoding can significantly speed up jobs with long,
    #   visually complex content. Outputs that use this feature incur pro-tier
    #   pricing. For information about feature limitations, see the AWS
    #   Elemental MediaConvert User Guide.
    #
    # @option params [String] :category
    #   Optional. A category for the job template you are creating
    #
    # @option params [String] :description
    #   Optional. A description of the job template you are creating.
    #
    # @option params [Array<Types::HopDestination>] :hop_destinations
    #   Optional. Use queue hopping to avoid overly long waits in the backlog
    #   of the queue that you submit your job to. Specify an alternate queue
    #   and the maximum time that your job will wait in the initial queue
    #   before hopping. For more information about this feature, see the AWS
    #   Elemental MediaConvert User Guide.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :name
    #   The name of the job template you are creating.
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :priority
    #   Specify the relative priority for this job. In any given queue, the
    #   service begins processing the job with the highest value first. When
    #   more than one job has the same priority, the service begins processing
    #   the job that you submitted first. If you don't specify a priority,
    #   the service uses the default value 0.
    #
    # @option params [String] :queue
    #   Optional. The queue that jobs created from this template are assigned
    #   to. If you don't specify this, jobs will go to the default queue.
    #
    # @option params [required, Types::JobTemplateSettings] :settings
    #   JobTemplateSettings contains all the transcode settings saved in the
    #   template that will be applied to jobs created from it.
    #
    # @option params [String] :status_update_interval
    #   Specify how often MediaConvert sends STATUS\_UPDATE events to Amazon
    #   CloudWatch Events. Set the interval, in seconds, between status
    #   updates. MediaConvert sends an update at this interval from the time
    #   the service begins processing your job to the time it completes the
    #   transcode or encounters an error.
    #
    # @option params [Hash<String,String>] :tags
    #   The tags that you want to add to the resource. You can tag resources
    #   with a key-value pair or with only a key.
