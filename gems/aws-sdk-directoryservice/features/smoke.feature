  @directoryservice @smoke
  Scenario: DescribeDirectoriesSuccess
    Given I create a 'Aws::DirectoryService' client with config:
      """
{"region":"us-west-2"}
      """
    When I call the operation 'describe_directories' with params:
      """
{}
      """
    Then I expect an error was not raised
