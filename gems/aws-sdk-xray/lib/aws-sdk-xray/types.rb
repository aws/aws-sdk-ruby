    #   A map that contains one or more tag keys and tag values to attach to
    #   an X-Ray group or sampling rule. For more information about ways to
    #   use tags, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services resources][1] in the
    #   *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.
    #
    #   The following restrictions apply to tags:
    #
    #   * Maximum number of user-applied tags per resource: 50
    #
    #   * Maximum tag key length: 128 Unicode characters
    #
    #   * Maximum tag value length: 256 Unicode characters
    #
    #   * Valid values for key and value: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, space, and the
    #     following characters: \_ . : / = + - and @
    #
    #   * Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
    #
    #   * Don't use `aws:` as a prefix for keys; it's reserved for Amazon
    #     Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete system tags.
