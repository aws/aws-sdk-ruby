    #   you want to process and apply on top of other actions with lower
    #   number IDs. This prevents previous actions with lower number IDs
    #   from possibly overriding the latest action.
    #
    #   The ordering ID can be the UNIX time of the last update you made to
    #   a group members list. You would then provide this list when calling
    #   `PutPrincipalMapping`. This ensures your `PUT` action for that
    #   updated group with the latest members list doesn't get overwritten
    #   by earlier `PUT` actions for the same group which are yet to be

    #   2. You can only set the `Freshness` field on one `DATE` type field.

    #   @return [Boolean]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] importance
    #   The relative importance of the field in the search. Larger numbers
    #   provide more of a boost than smaller numbers.
    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] duration
    #   Specifies the time period that the boost applies to. For example, to

    #   last month, you would use "2628000s". Once the field value is
    #   beyond the specified range, the effect of the boost drops off. The
    #   higher the importance, the faster the effect drops off. If you
    #   don't specify a value, the default is 3 months. The value of the
    #   field is a numeric string followed by the character "s", for
    #   example "86400s" for one day, or "604800s" for one week.

    #   Determines how values should be interpreted.

    #   better. For example, a document with a rating score of 10 is higher
    #   ranking than a document with a rating score of 1.
    #
    #   When the `RankOrder` field is `DESCENDING`, lower numbers are
    #   better. For example, in a task tracking application, a priority 1
    #   task is more important than a priority 5 task.
    #
    #   Only applies to `LONG` and `DOUBLE` fields.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] value_importance_map
    #   A list of values that should be given a different boost when they
    #   appear in the result list. For example, if you are boosting a field
    #   called "department," query terms that match the department field
    #   are boosted in the result. However, you can add entries from the
    #   department field to boost documents with those values higher.
    #
    #   For example, you can add entries to the map with names of
    #   departments. If you add "HR",5 and "Legal",3 those departments
    #   are given special attention when they appear in the metadata of a
    #   document. When those terms appear they are given the specified

    #
    #   Web proxy credentials are optional and you can use them to connect
    #   to a web proxy server that requires basic authentication of user
    #   name and password. To store web proxy credentials, you use a secret
    #   in Secrets Manager.
    #
    #   It is recommended that you follow best security practices when
    #   configuring your web proxy. This includes setting up throttling,
    #   setting up logging and monitoring, and applying security patches on
    #   a regular basis. If you use your web proxy with multiple data
    #   sources, sync jobs that occur at the same time could strain the load
    #   on your proxy. It is recommended you prepare your proxy beforehand
