    # @!attribute [rw] evaluate_target_health
    #   *Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency
    #   alias, and weighted alias resource record sets:* When
    #   `EvaluateTargetHealth` is `true`, an alias resource record set
    #   inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as an ELB
    #   load balancer, or the referenced resource record set.
    #
    #   Note the following:
    #
    #   * You can't set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` when the alias
    #     target is a CloudFront distribution.
    #
    #   * If the AWS resource that you specify in `AliasTarget` is a
    #     resource record set or a group of resource record sets (for
    #     example, a group of weighted resource record sets), but it is not
    #     another alias resource record set, we recommend that you associate
    #     a health check with all of the resource record sets in the alias
    #     target. For more information, see [What Happens When You Omit
    #     Health Checks?][1] in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   * If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in `HostedZoneId`
    #     and `DNSName`, and if the environment contains an ELB load
    #     balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the
    #     healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load
    #     balancer. (An environment automatically contains an ELB load
    #     balancer if it includes more than one EC2 instance.) If you set
    #     `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` and either no EC2 instances are
    #     healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53
    #     routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if
    #     any.
    #
    #     If the environment contains a single EC2 instance, there are no
    #     special requirements.
    #
    #   * If you specify an ELB load balancer in ` AliasTarget `, ELB routes
    #     queries only to the healthy EC2 instances that are registered with
    #     the load balancer. If no EC2 instances are healthy or if the load
    #     balancer itself is unhealthy, and if `EvaluateTargetHealth` is
    #     true for the corresponding alias resource record set, Amazon Route
    #     53 routes queries to other resources. When you create a load
    #     balancer, you configure settings for ELB health checks; they're
    #     not Amazon Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar
    #     function. Do not create Amazon Route 53 health checks for the EC2
    #     instances that you register with an ELB load balancer.
    #
    #     For more information, see [How Health Checks Work in More Complex
    #     Amazon Route 53 Configurations][2] in the *Amazon Route 53
    #     Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   * We recommend that you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true only when
    #     you have enough idle capacity to handle the failure of one or more
    #     endpoints.
    #
    #   For more information and examples, see [Amazon Route 53 Health

    # @!attribute [rw] ip_address
    #   The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon
    #   Route 53 to perform health checks on. If you don't specify a value
    #   for `IPAddress`, Amazon Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the
    #   domain name that you specify in `FullyQualifiedDomainName` at the
    #   interval that you specify in `RequestInterval`. Using an IP address
    #   returned by DNS, Amazon Route 53 then checks the health of the
    #   endpoint.
    #
    #   Use one of the following formats for the value of `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   * **IPv4 address**\: four values between 0 and 255, separated by
    #     periods (.), for example, `192.0.2.44`.
    #
    #   * **IPv6 address**\: eight groups of four hexadecimal values,
    #     separated by colons (:), for example,
    #     `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`. You can also shorten
    #     IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example,
    #     `2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`.
    #
    #   If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an
    #   Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify
    #   the Elastic IP address for `IPAddress`. This ensures that the IP
    #   address of your instance will never change.
    #
    #   For more information, see
    #   HealthCheckConfig$FullyQualifiedDomainName.
    #
    #   Constraints: Amazon Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints
    #   for which the IP address is in local, private, non-routable, or

    #
    #   You can't change the value of `Type` after you create a health
    #   check.
    #
    #   You can create the following types of health checks:
    #
    #   * **HTTP**\: Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If
    #     successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for
    #     an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.
    #
    #   * **HTTPS**\: Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.
    #     If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits
    #     for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.
    #
    #     If you specify `HTTPS` for the value of `Type`, the endpoint must
    #     support TLS v1.0 or later.
    #
    #   * **HTTP\_STR\_MATCH**\: Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP
    #     connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTP request
    #     and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
    #     string that you specify in `SearchString`.
    #
    #   * **HTTPS\_STR\_MATCH**\: Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP
    #     connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an `HTTPS`
    #     request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body
    #     for the string that you specify in `SearchString`.
    #
    #   * **TCP**\: Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.
    #
    #   * **CLOUDWATCH\_METRIC**\: The health check is associated with a
    #     CloudWatch alarm. If the state of the alarm is `OK`, the health
    #     check is considered healthy. If the state is `ALARM`, the health
    #     check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have
    #     sufficient data to determine whether the state is `OK` or `ALARM`,
    #     the health check status depends on the setting for
    #     `InsufficientDataHealthStatus`\: `Healthy`, `Unhealthy`, or
    #     `LastKnownStatus`.
    #
    #   * **CALCULATED**\: For health checks that monitor the status of
    #     other health checks, Amazon Route 53 adds up the number of health
    #     checks that Amazon Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy
    #     and compares that number with the value of `HealthThreshold`.

    # @!attribute [rw] resource_path
    #   The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when
    #   performing health checks. The path can be any value for which your
    #   endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx when the
    #   endpoint is healthy, for example, the file

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] fully_qualified_domain_name
    #   Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for
    #   `IPAddress`.
    #
    #   **If you specify a value for** `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or
    #   IPv6 address and passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in
    #   the `Host` header for all health checks except TCP health checks.
    #   This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on
    #   which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks.
    #
    #   When Amazon Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how
    #   it constructs the `Host` header:
    #
    #   * If you specify a value of `80` for `Port` and `HTTP` or
    #     `HTTP_STR_MATCH` for `Type`, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of
    #     `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the Host header.
    #
    #   * If you specify a value of `443` for `Port` and `HTTPS` or
    #     `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` for `Type`, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of
    #     `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
    #
    #   * If you specify another value for `Port` and any value except `TCP`
    #     for `Type`, Amazon Route 53 passes `FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port`
    #     to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, Amazon
    #   Route 53 substitutes the value of `IPAddress` in the `Host` header
    #   in each of the preceding cases.
    #
    #   <b>If you don't specify a value for <code>IPAddress</code> </b>\:
    #
    #   Amazon Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify
    #   for `FullyQualifiedDomainName` at the interval that you specify for
    #   `RequestInterval`. Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Amazon
    #   Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`, Amazon Route 53 uses
    #   only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no
    #   resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify
    #   for `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, the health check fails with a "DNS
    #   resolution failed" error.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover
    #   resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, we recommend that you create a separate
    #   health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check
    #   for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com.
    #   For the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, specify the domain name
    #   of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of
    #   the resource record sets (www.example.com).
    #
    #   In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the
    #   value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` matches the name of the resource
    #   record sets and you then associate the health check with those
    #   resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.
    #
    #   In addition, if the value that you specify for `Type` is `HTTP`,
    #   `HTTPS`, `HTTP_STR_MATCH`, or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH`, Amazon Route 53
    #   passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header,
    #   as it does when you specify a value for `IPAddress`. If the value of
    #   `Type` is `TCP`, Amazon Route 53 doesn't pass a `Host` header.

    #   (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one
    #   `ChildHealthCheck` element for each health check that you want to
    #   associate with a `CALCULATED` health check.
    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] enable_sni
    #   Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `client_hello`
    #   message during TLS negotiation. This allows the endpoint to respond
    #   to `HTTPS` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS
    #   certificate.
    #
    #   Some endpoints require that `HTTPS` requests include the host name
    #   in the `client_hello` message. If you don't enable SNI, the status
    #   of the health check will be `SSL alert handshake_failure`. A health
    #   check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is enabled
    #   and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration
    #   on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid.
    #
    #   The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in
    #   the `Common Name` field and possibly several more in the `Subject
    #   Alternative Names` field. One of the domain names in the certificate
    #   should match the value that you specify for
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`. If the endpoint responds to the
    #   `client_hello` message with a certificate that does not include the
    #   domain name that you specified in `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, a
    #   health checker will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the
    #   health checker will omit `FullyQualifiedDomainName` from the
    #   `client_hello` message.

    #   A complex type that contains one `Region` element for each region
    #   from which you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the
    #   specified endpoint.
    #
    #   If you don't specify any regions, Amazon Route 53 health checkers
    #   automatically performs checks from all of the regions that are
    #   listed under **Valid Values**.
    #
    #   If you update a health check to remove a region that has been
    #   performing health checks, Amazon Route 53 will briefly continue to
    #   perform checks from that region to ensure that some health checkers
    #   are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three
    #   regions with four different regions).

    #   When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine
    #   the alarm state, the status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign
    #   to the health check:
    #
    #   * `Healthy`\: Amazon Route 53 considers the health check to be
    #     healthy.
    #
    #   * `Unhealthy`\: Amazon Route 53 considers the health check to be
    #     unhealthy.
    #
    #   * `LastKnownStatus`\: Amazon Route 53 uses the status of the health
    #     check from the last time that CloudWatch had sufficient data to
    #     determine the alarm state. For new health checks that have no last
    #     known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

    #   that have the same combination of DNS name and type, a value that
    #   determines the proportion of DNS queries that Amazon Route 53
    #   responds to using the current resource record set. Amazon Route 53
    #   calculates the sum of the weights for the resource record sets that
    #   have the same combination of DNS name and type. Amazon Route 53 then
    #   responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource's weight to
    #   the total. Note the following:
    #
    #   * You must specify a value for the `Weight` element for every
    #     weighted resource record set.
    #
    #   * You can only specify one `ResourceRecord` per weighted resource
    #     record set.

    #   * You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource

    #     elements as weighted resource record sets.
    #
    #   * You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that
    #     have the same values for the `Name` and `Type` elements.
    #
    #   * For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you
    #     set `Weight` to `0` for a resource record set, Amazon Route 53
    #     never responds to queries with the applicable value for that
    #     resource record set. However, if you set `Weight` to `0` for all
    #     resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name
    #     and type, traffic is routed to all resources with equal
    #     probability.
    #
    #     The effect of setting `Weight` to `0` is different when you
    #     associate health checks with weighted resource record sets. For

    #   *Latency-based resource record sets only:* The Amazon EC2 Region

    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and type
    #   for which you have created latency resource record sets, Amazon
    #   Route 53 selects the latency resource record set that has the lowest

    #     latency resource record sets for.

    #   *Geo location resource record sets only:* A complex type that lets
    #   you control how Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the
    #   geographic origin of the query. For example, if you want all queries
    #   from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of
    #   `192.0.2.111`, create a resource record set with a `Type` of `A` and
    #   a `ContinentCode` of `AF`.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in
    #   private hosted zones is not supported.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping
    #   geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a
    #   continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority
    #   goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route
    #   most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries
    #   for a country on that continent to a different resource.
    #
    #   You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify
    #   the same geographic location.
    #
    #   The value `*` in the `CountryCode` element matches all geographic
    #   locations that aren't specified in other geolocation resource
    #   record sets that have the same values for the `Name` and `Type`
    #   elements.
    #
    #   Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However,
    #   some IP addresses aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if
    #   you create geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven
    #   continents, Amazon Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from
    #   locations that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a
    #   resource record set for which the value of `CountryCode` is `*`,
    #   which handles both queries that come from locations for which you
    #   haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from
    #   IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create
    #   a `*` resource record set, Amazon Route 53 returns a "no answer"
    #   response for queries from those locations.
    #
    #   You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the
    #   same values for the `Name` and `Type` elements as geolocation
    #   resource record sets.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] failover
    #   *Failover resource record sets only:* To configure failover, you add
    #   the `Failover` element to two resource record sets. For one resource
    #   record set, you specify `PRIMARY` as the value for `Failover`; for
    #   the other resource record set, you specify `SECONDARY`. In addition,
    #   you include the `HealthCheckId` element and specify the health check
    #   that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform for each resource record
    #   set.
    #
    #   Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that you
    #   have included the `HealthCheckId` element in both resource record
    #   sets:
    #
    #   * When the primary resource record set is healthy, Amazon Route 53
    #     responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary
    #     resource record set regardless of the health of the secondary
    #     resource record set.
    #
    #   * When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the
    #     secondary resource record set is healthy, Amazon Route 53 responds
    #     to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary
    #     resource record set.
    #
    #   * When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route
    #     53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the
    #     primary resource record set regardless of the health of the
    #     primary resource record set.
    #
    #   * If you omit the `HealthCheckId` element for the secondary resource
    #     record set, and if the primary resource record set is unhealthy,
    #     Amazon Route 53 always responds to DNS queries with the applicable
    #     value from the secondary resource record set. This is true
    #     regardless of the health of the associated endpoint.
    #
    #   You can't create non-failover resource record sets that have the

    #     corresponding IP address only when the health check is healthy.
    #

    # @!attribute [rw] health_check_id
    #   If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in
    #   response to a DNS query only when a health check is passing, include
    #   the `HealthCheckId` element and specify the ID of the applicable
    #   health check.
    #
    #   Amazon Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy
    #   based on one of the following:
    #
    #   * By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is
    #     specified in the health check
    #
    #   * By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks
    #     (calculated health checks)
    #
    #   * By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch
    #     metric health checks)
    #
    #   For more information, see [How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an
    #   Endpoint Is Healthy][1].
    #
    #   The `HealthCheckId` element is only useful when Amazon Route 53 is
    #   choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a
    #   DNS query, and you want Amazon Route 53 to base the choice in part
    #   on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks only
    #   makes sense in the following configurations:
    #
    #   * You're checking the health of the resource record sets in a group
    #     of weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover resource record
    #     sets, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource
    #     record sets. If the health check for one resource record set
    #     specifies an endpoint that is not healthy, Amazon Route 53 stops
    #     responding to queries using the value for that resource record
    #     set.
    #
    #   * You set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for the resource record
    #     sets in a group of alias, weighted alias, latency alias,
    #     geolocation alias, or failover alias resource record sets, and you
    #     specify health check IDs for all of the resource record sets that
    #     are referenced by the alias resource record sets.
    #
    #   Amazon Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint specified
    #   in the resource record set, for example, the endpoint specified by
    #   the IP address in the `Value` element. When you add a
    #   `HealthCheckId` element to a resource record set, Amazon Route 53
    #   checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health
    #   check.
    #
    #   For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy,
    #   Amazon Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger,
    #   associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource
    #   record sets for a state in the United States, for the United States,
    #   for North America, and for all locations. If the endpoint for the
    #   state resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 checks the
    #   resource record sets for the United States, for North America, and
    #   for all locations (a resource record set for which the value of
    #   `CountryCode` is `*`), in that order, until it finds a resource
    #   record set for which the endpoint is healthy.
    #
    #   If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we
    #   recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint.
    #   For example, create a health check for each `HTTP` server that is
    #   serving content for `www.example.com`. For the value of
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, specify the domain name of the server
    #   (such as `us-east-2-www.example.com`), not the name of the resource
    #   record sets (example.com).
    #
    #   n this configuration, if you create a health check for which the
    #   value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` matches the name of the resource
    #   record sets and then associate the health check with those resource
    #   record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.
    #

    #   A sequential counter that Amazon Route 53 sets to `1` when you

    #
    #   We recommend that you use `GetHealthCheck` or `ListHealthChecks` to
    #   get the current value of `HealthCheckVersion` for the health check
    #   that you want to update, and that you include that value in your
    #   `UpdateHealthCheck` request. This prevents Amazon Route 53 from
    #   overwriting an intervening update:
    #
    #   * If the value in the `UpdateHealthCheck` request matches the value
    #     of `HealthCheckVersion` in the health check, Amazon Route 53
    #     updates the health check with the new settings.
    #
    #   * If the value of `HealthCheckVersion` in the health check is
    #     greater, the health check was changed after you got the version
    #     number. Amazon Route 53 does not update the health check, and it
    #     returns a `HealthCheckVersionMismatch` error.
    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] ip_address
    #   The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address for the endpoint that you want Amazon
    #   Route 53 to perform health checks on. If you don't specify a value
    #   for `IPAddress`, Amazon Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the
    #   domain name that you specify in `FullyQualifiedDomainName` at the
    #   interval that you specify in `RequestInterval`. Using an IP address
    #   that is returned by DNS, Amazon Route 53 then checks the health of
    #   the endpoint.
    #
    #   Use one of the following formats for the value of `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   * **IPv4 address**\: four values between 0 and 255, separated by
    #     periods (.), for example, `192.0.2.44`.
    #
    #   * **IPv6 address**\: eight groups of four hexadecimal values,
    #     separated by colons (:), for example,
    #     `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`. You can also shorten
    #     IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example,
    #     `2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`.
    #
    #   If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an
    #   Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify
    #   the Elastic IP address for `IPAddress`. This ensures that the IP
    #   address of your instance never changes. For more information, see
    #   the applicable documentation:

    # @!attribute [rw] fully_qualified_domain_name
    #   Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for

    #   <note markdown="1"> If a health check already has a value for `IPAddress`, you can
    #   change the value. However, you can't update an existing health

    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   **If you specify a value for** `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or
    #   IPv6 address and passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in
    #   the `Host` header for all health checks except TCP health checks.
    #   This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on
    #   which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks.
    #
    #   When Amazon Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how
    #   it constructs the `Host` header:
    #
    #   * If you specify a value of `80` for `Port` and `HTTP` or
    #     `HTTP_STR_MATCH` for `Type`, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of
    #     `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
    #
    #   * If you specify a value of `443` for `Port` and `HTTPS` or
    #     `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` for `Type`, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of
    #     `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
    #
    #   * If you specify another value for `Port` and any value except `TCP`
    #     for `Type`, Amazon Route 53 passes <i>
    #     <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>\:<code>Port</code> </i> to
    #     the endpoint in the `Host` header.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, Amazon
    #   Route 53 substitutes the value of `IPAddress` in the `Host` header
    #   in each of the above cases.
    #
    #   **If you don't specify a value for** `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`, Amazon Route 53 sends
    #   a DNS request to the domain that you specify in
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName` at the interval you specify in
    #   `RequestInterval`. Using an IPv4 address that is returned by DNS,
    #   Amazon Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`, Amazon Route 53 uses
    #   only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no
    #   resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify
    #   for `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, the health check fails with a "DNS
    #   resolution failed" error.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover
    #   resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, we recommend that you create a separate
    #   health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check
    #   for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com.
    #   For the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, specify the domain name
    #   of the server (such as `us-east-2-www.example.com`), not the name of
    #   the resource record sets (www.example.com).
    #
    #   In this configuration, if the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName`
    #   matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate
    #   the health check with those resource record sets, health check
    #   results will be unpredictable.
    #
    #   In addition, if the value of `Type` is `HTTP`, `HTTPS`,
    #   `HTTP_STR_MATCH`, or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH`, Amazon Route 53 passes the
    #   value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header, as it does
    #   when you specify a value for `IPAddress`. If the value of `Type` is
    #   `TCP`, Amazon Route 53 doesn't pass a `Host` header.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] search_string
    #   If the value of `Type` is `HTTP_STR_MATCH` or `HTTP_STR_MATCH`, the
    #   string that you want Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response
    #   body from the specified resource. If the string appears in the
    #   response body, Amazon Route 53 considers the resource healthy. (You
    #   can't change the value of `Type` when you update a health check.)
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] failure_threshold
    #   The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass
    #   or fail for Amazon Route 53 to change the current status of the
    #   endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more
    #   information, see [How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint
    #   Is Healthy][1] in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for `FailureThreshold`, the default
    #   value is three health checks.

    #   @return [Boolean]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] health_threshold
    #   The number of child health checks that are associated with a

    #   the `CALCULATED` health check to be considered healthy. To specify
    #   the child health checks that you want to associate with a
    #   `CALCULATED` health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks` and
    #   `ChildHealthCheck` elements.
    #
    #   Note the following:
    #
    #   * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health
    #     checks, Amazon Route 53 always considers this health check to be
    #     unhealthy.

    #     check to be healthy.

    # @!attribute [rw] child_health_checks
    #   A complex type that contains one `ChildHealthCheck` element for each

    #   check.
    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] enable_sni
    #   Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `client_hello`
    #   message during `TLS` negotiation. This allows the endpoint to
    #   respond to `HTTPS` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS
    #   certificate.
    #
    #   Some endpoints require that HTTPS requests include the host name in
    #   the `client_hello` message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of
    #   the health check will be SSL alert `handshake_failure`. A health
    #   check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is enabled
    #   and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration
    #   on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid.
    #
    #   The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in
    #   the `Common Name` field and possibly several more in the `Subject
    #   Alternative Names` field. One of the domain names in the certificate
    #   should match the value that you specify for
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`. If the endpoint responds to the
    #   `client_hello` message with a certificate that does not include the
    #   domain name that you specified in `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, a
    #   health checker will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the
    #   health checker will omit `FullyQualifiedDomainName` from the
    #   `client_hello` message.

    #
    #   * `Healthy`\: Amazon Route 53 considers the health check to be
    #     healthy.
    #
    #   * `Unhealthy`\: Amazon Route 53 considers the health check to be
