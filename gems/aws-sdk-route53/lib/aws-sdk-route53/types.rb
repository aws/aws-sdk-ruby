    #     For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain
    #     name doesn't include the region. To route traffic to these
    #     environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an alias
    #     record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root
    #     domain name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you
    #     can create a record that routes traffic for acme.example.com to
    #     your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record
    #     that routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk
    #     environment.
    #
    #     For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized

    #     the environment contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load
    #     Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances
    #     that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment
    #     automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more
    #     than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth`
    #     to `true` and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the
    #     load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to
    #     other available resources that are healthy, if any.
    #
    #     If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there
    #     are no special requirements.
    #
    #   ELB load balancers
    #
    #   : Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:
    #
    #     * **Classic Load Balancers**\: If you specify an ELB Classic Load
    #       Balancer in `DNSName`, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries
    #       only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered
    #       with the load balancer. If you set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to
    #       `true` and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load
    #       balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other
    #       resources.
    #
    #     * **Application and Network Load Balancers**\: If you specify an
    #       ELB Application or Network Load Balancer and you set
    #       `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true`, Route 53 routes queries to the
    #       load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are
    #       associated with the load balancer:
    #
    #       * For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered
    #         healthy, every target group that contains targets must contain
    #         at least one healthy target. If any target group contains only
    #         unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy,
    #         and Route 53 routes queries to other resources.
    #
    #       * A target group that has no registered targets is considered
    #         unhealthy.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for
    #     Elastic Load Balancing health checks; they're not Route 53 health
    #     checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not create Route
    #     53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an
    #     ELB load balancer.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   S3 buckets
    #
    #   : There are no special requirements for setting
    #     `EvaluateTargetHealth` to `true` when the alias target is an S3
    #     bucket.
    #
    #   Other records in the same hosted zone
    #
    #   : If the Amazon Web Services resource that you specify in `DNSName`
    #     is a record or a group of records (for example, a group of
    #     weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend
    #     that you associate a health check with all of the records in the
    #     alias target. For more information, see [What Happens When You
    #     Omit Health Checks?][1] in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

    #   The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon

    #   for `IPAddress`, Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the domain
    #   name that you specify in `FullyQualifiedDomainName` at the interval
    #   that you specify in `RequestInterval`. Using an IP address returned
    #   by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.
    #
    #   Use one of the following formats for the value of `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   * **IPv4 address**\: four values between 0 and 255, separated by
    #     periods (.), for example, `192.0.2.44`.
    #
    #   * **IPv6 address**\: eight groups of four hexadecimal values,
    #     separated by colons (:), for example,
    #     `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`. You can also shorten
    #     IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example,
    #     `2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`.
    #
    #   If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an
    #   Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify
    #   the Elastic IP address for `IPAddress`. This ensures that the IP
    #   address of your instance will never change.
    #
    #   For more information, see [FullyQualifiedDomainName][1].
    #
    #   Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which
    #   the IP address is in local, private, non-routable, or multicast
    #   ranges. For more information about IP addresses for which you can't
    #   create health checks, see the following documents:

    #
    #   You can't change the value of `Type` after you create a health
    #   check.
    #
    #   You can create the following types of health checks:
    #
    #   * **HTTP**\: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If
    #     successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP
    #     status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.
    #
    #   * **HTTPS**\: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If
    #     successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an
    #     HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.
    #
    #     If you specify `HTTPS` for the value of `Type`, the endpoint must
    #     support TLS v1.0 or later.
    #
    #   * **HTTP\_STR\_MATCH**\: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP
    #     connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and
    #     searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string
    #     that you specify in `SearchString`.
    #
    #   * **HTTPS\_STR\_MATCH**\: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP
    #     connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an `HTTPS` request and
    #     searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string
    #     that you specify in `SearchString`.
    #
    #   * **TCP**\: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.
    #
    #   * **CLOUDWATCH\_METRIC**\: The health check is associated with a
    #     CloudWatch alarm. If the state of the alarm is `OK`, the health
    #     check is considered healthy. If the state is `ALARM`, the health
    #     check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have
    #     sufficient data to determine whether the state is `OK` or `ALARM`,
    #     the health check status depends on the setting for
    #     `InsufficientDataHealthStatus`\: `Healthy`, `Unhealthy`, or
    #     `LastKnownStatus`.
    #
    #   * **CALCULATED**\: For health checks that monitor the status of
    #     other health checks, Route 53 adds up the number of health checks
    #     that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy and compares
    #     that number with the value of `HealthThreshold`.
    #
    #   * **RECOVERY\_CONTROL**\: The health check is assocated with a
    #     Route53 Application Recovery Controller routing control. If the
    #     routing control state is `ON`, the health check is considered
    #     healthy. If the state is `OFF`, the health check is considered
    #     unhealthy.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] fully_qualified_domain_name
    #   Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for
    #   `IPAddress`.
    #
    #   **If you specify a value for** `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or
    #   IPv6 address and passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in
    #   the `Host` header for all health checks except TCP health checks.
    #   This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on
    #   which you want Route 53 to perform health checks.
    #
    #   When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it
    #   constructs the `Host` header:
    #
    #   * If you specify a value of `80` for `Port` and `HTTP` or
    #     `HTTP_STR_MATCH` for `Type`, Route 53 passes the value of
    #     `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the Host header.
    #
    #   * If you specify a value of `443` for `Port` and `HTTPS` or
    #     `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` for `Type`, Route 53 passes the value of
    #     `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
    #
    #   * If you specify another value for `Port` and any value except `TCP`
    #     for `Type`, Route 53 passes `FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port` to the
    #     endpoint in the `Host` header.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, Route
    #   53 substitutes the value of `IPAddress` in the `Host` header in each
    #   of the preceding cases.
    #
    #   **If you don't specify a value for** `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName` at the interval that you specify for
    #   `RequestInterval`. Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Route 53
    #   then checks the health of the endpoint.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`, Route 53 uses only
    #   IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource
    #   record set with a type of A for the name that you specify for
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, the health check fails with a "DNS
    #   resolution failed" error.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover
    #   resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, we recommend that you create a separate
    #   health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check
    #   for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com.
    #   For the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, specify the domain name
    #   of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of
    #   the resource record sets (www.example.com).
    #
    #   In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the
    #   value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` matches the name of the resource
    #   record sets and you then associate the health check with those
    #   resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.
    #
    #   In addition, if the value that you specify for `Type` is `HTTP`,
    #   `HTTPS`, `HTTP_STR_MATCH`, or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH`, Route 53 passes the
    #   value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header, as it does
    #   when you specify a value for `IPAddress`. If the value of `Type` is
    #   `TCP`, Route 53 doesn't pass a `Host` header.

    #
    #   You can't change the value of `RequestInterval` after you create a

    #   @return [Boolean]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] disabled
    #   Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a
    #   health check, here's what happens:
    #
    #   * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53
    #     stops submitting requests to your application, server, or other
    #     resource.
    #
    #   * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the
    #     status of the referenced health checks.
    #
    #   * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops
    #     monitoring the corresponding CloudWatch metrics.
    #
    #   After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of
    #   the health check to always be healthy. If you configured DNS
    #   failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to the corresponding
    #   resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change
    #   the value of [Inverted][1].
    #
    #   Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is
    #   disabled. For more information, see [Amazon Route 53 Pricing][2].

    #   The number of child health checks that are associated with a

    #   for the `CALCULATED` health check to be considered healthy. To
    #   specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a
    #   `CALCULATED` health check, use the [ChildHealthChecks][1] element.
    #
    #   Note the following:
    #
    #   * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health
    #     checks, Route 53 always considers this health check to be
    #     unhealthy.
    #

    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] enable_sni
    #   Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `client_hello`
    #   message during TLS negotiation. This allows the endpoint to respond
    #   to `HTTPS` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS
    #   certificate.
    #
    #   Some endpoints require that `HTTPS` requests include the host name
    #   in the `client_hello` message. If you don't enable SNI, the status
    #   of the health check will be `SSL alert handshake_failure`. A health
    #   check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is enabled
    #   and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration
    #   on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid.
    #
    #   The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in
    #   the `Common Name` field and possibly several more in the `Subject
    #   Alternative Names` field. One of the domain names in the certificate
    #   should match the value that you specify for
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`. If the endpoint responds to the
    #   `client_hello` message with a certificate that does not include the
    #   domain name that you specified in `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, a
    #   health checker will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the
    #   health checker will omit `FullyQualifiedDomainName` from the
    #   `client_hello` message.
    #   @return [Boolean]

    #   A complex type that contains one `Region` element for each region
    #   from which you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the
    #   specified endpoint.
    #
    #   If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers
    #   automatically performs checks from all of the regions that are
    #   listed under **Valid Values**.
    #
    #   If you update a health check to remove a region that has been
    #   performing health checks, Route 53 will briefly continue to perform
    #   checks from that region to ensure that some health checkers are
    #   always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three
    #   regions with four different regions).
    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] alarm_identifier
    #   A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want
    #   Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to determine whether the
    #   specified health check is healthy.
    #   @return [Types::AlarmIdentifier]

    #   When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine
    #   the alarm state, the status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign
    #   to the health check:
    #
    #   * `Healthy`\: Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.
    #
    #   * `Unhealthy`\: Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.
    #
    #   * `LastKnownStatus`\: Route 53 uses the status of the health check
    #     from the last time that CloudWatch had sufficient data to
    #     determine the alarm state. For new health checks that have no last
    #     known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.

    #   You can optionally include a trailing dot. If you omit the trailing
    #   dot, Amazon Route 53 assumes that the domain name that you specify
    #   is fully qualified. This means that Route 53 treats
    #   `www.example.com` (without a trailing dot) and `www.example.com.`
    #   (with a trailing dot) as identical.
    #
    #   For information about how to specify characters other than `a-z`,

    #
    #   * The * must replace the entire label. For example, you can't
    #     specify `*prod.example.com` or `prod*.example.com`.
    #
    #   * The * can't replace any of the middle labels, for example,
    #     marketing.*.example.com.
    #
    #   * If you include * in any position other than the leftmost label in
    #     a domain name, DNS treats it as an * character (ASCII 42), not as
    #     a wildcard.
    #
    #     You can't use the * wildcard for resource records sets that have

    #   *Weighted resource record sets only:* Among resource record sets
    #   that have the same combination of DNS name and type, a value that
    #   determines the proportion of DNS queries that Amazon Route 53
    #   responds to using the current resource record set. Route 53
    #   calculates the sum of the weights for the resource record sets that
    #   have the same combination of DNS name and type. Route 53 then
    #   responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource's weight to
    #   the total. Note the following:
    #
    #   * You must specify a value for the `Weight` element for every
    #     weighted resource record set.
    #
    #   * You can only specify one `ResourceRecord` per weighted resource
    #     record set.

    #   * You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource
    #     record sets that have the same values for the `Name` and `Type`
    #     elements as weighted resource record sets.
    #
    #   * You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that
    #     have the same values for the `Name` and `Type` elements.
    #
    #   * For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you
    #     set `Weight` to `0` for a resource record set, Route 53 never
    #     responds to queries with the applicable value for that resource
    #     record set. However, if you set `Weight` to `0` for all resource
    #     record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type,
    #     traffic is routed to all resources with equal probability.
    #
    #     The effect of setting `Weight` to `0` is different when you

    # @!attribute [rw] region
    #   *Latency-based resource record sets only:* The Amazon EC2 Region
    #   where you created the resource that this resource record set refers
    #   to. The resource typically is an Amazon Web Services resource, such
    #   as an EC2 instance or an ELB load balancer, and is referred to by an
    #   IP address or a DNS domain name, depending on the record type.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Although creating latency and latency alias resource record sets in
    #   a private hosted zone is allowed, it's not supported.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and type
    #   for which you have created latency resource record sets, Route 53
    #   selects the latency resource record set that has the lowest latency
    #   between the end user and the associated Amazon EC2 Region. Route 53
    #   then returns the value that is associated with the selected resource
    #   record set.
    #
    #   Note the following:
    #
    #   * You can only specify one `ResourceRecord` per latency resource

    #
    #   * You can only create one latency resource record set for each

    #     all Amazon EC2 Regions. Route 53 will choose the region with the
    #     best latency from among the regions that you create latency
    #     resource record sets for.
    #
    #   * You can't create non-latency resource record sets that have the

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] geo_location
    #   *Geolocation resource record sets only:* A complex type that lets
    #   you control how Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the
    #   geographic origin of the query. For example, if you want all queries
    #   from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of
    #   `192.0.2.111`, create a resource record set with a `Type` of `A` and
    #   a `ContinentCode` of `AF`.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> Although creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record
    #   sets in a private hosted zone is allowed, it's not supported.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping
    #   geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a
    #   continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority
    #   goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route
    #   most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries
    #   for a country on that continent to a different resource.
    #
    #   You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify
    #   the same geographic location.
    #
    #   The value `*` in the `CountryCode` element matches all geographic
    #   locations that aren't specified in other geolocation resource
    #   record sets that have the same values for the `Name` and `Type`
    #   elements.
    #
    #   Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However,
    #   some IP addresses aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if
    #   you create geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven
    #   continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations
    #   that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource
    #   record set for which the value of `CountryCode` is `*`. Two groups
    #   of queries are routed to the resource that you specify in this
    #   record: queries that come from locations for which you haven't
    #   created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP
    #   addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a
    #   `*` resource record set, Route 53 returns a "no answer" response
    #   for queries from those locations.
    #
    #   You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the
    #   same values for the `Name` and `Type` elements as geolocation
    #   resource record sets.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] failover
    #   *Failover resource record sets only:* To configure failover, you add
    #   the `Failover` element to two resource record sets. For one resource
    #   record set, you specify `PRIMARY` as the value for `Failover`; for
    #   the other resource record set, you specify `SECONDARY`. In addition,
    #   you include the `HealthCheckId` element and specify the health check
    #   that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform for each resource record
    #   set.
    #
    #   Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that you
    #   have included the `HealthCheckId` element in both resource record
    #   sets:
    #
    #   * When the primary resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds
    #     to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary resource
    #     record set regardless of the health of the secondary resource
    #     record set.
    #
    #   * When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the
    #     secondary resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS
    #     queries with the applicable value from the secondary resource
    #     record set.
    #
    #   * When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53
    #     responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary
    #     resource record set regardless of the health of the primary
    #     resource record set.
    #
    #   * If you omit the `HealthCheckId` element for the secondary resource
    #     record set, and if the primary resource record set is unhealthy,
    #     Route 53 always responds to DNS queries with the applicable value
    #     from the secondary resource record set. This is true regardless of
    #     the health of the associated endpoint.
    #
    #   You can't create non-failover resource record sets that have the
    #   same values for the `Name` and `Type` elements as failover resource
    #   record sets.

    #     record set, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the
    #     corresponding IP address only when the health check is healthy.
    #
    #   * If you don't associate a health check with a multivalue answer
    #     record, Route 53 always considers the record to be healthy.

    # @!attribute [rw] health_check_id
    #   If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in
    #   response to a DNS query only when the status of a health check is
    #   healthy, include the `HealthCheckId` element and specify the ID of
    #   the applicable health check.
    #
    #   Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based
    #   on one of the following:
    #
    #   * By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is
    #     specified in the health check
    #
    #   * By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks
    #     (calculated health checks)
    #
    #   * By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch
    #     metric health checks)
    #
    #   Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint that is specified
    #   in the resource record set, for example, the endpoint specified by
    #   the IP address in the `Value` element. When you add a
    #   `HealthCheckId` element to a resource record set, Route 53 checks
    #   the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check.
    #
    #   For more information, see the following topics in the *Amazon Route
    #   53 Developer Guide*\:
    #
    #   * [How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy][1]
    #
    #   * [Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover][2]
    #
    #   * [Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone][3]
    #
    #   **When to Specify HealthCheckId**
    #
    #   Specifying a value for `HealthCheckId` is useful only when Route 53
    #   is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a
    #   DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the
    #   status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only
    #   in the following configurations:
    #
    #   * **Non-alias resource record sets**\: You're checking the health
    #     of a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same
    #     routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records
    #     named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health
    #     check IDs for all the resource record sets.
    #
    #     If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy,
    #     Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to
    #     DNS queries with.
    #
    #     If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy,
    #     Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that
    #     resource record set.
    #
    #     If the health check status for all resource record sets in the
    #     group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in
    #     the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.
    #
    #   * **Alias resource record sets**\: You specify the following
    #     settings:
    #
    #     * You set `EvaluateTargetHealth` to true for an alias resource
    #       record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same
    #       routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted
    #       records named www.example.com with a type of A).
    #
    #     * You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to
    #       a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.
    #
    #     * You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record
    #       set.
    #
    #     If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the
    #     alias resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias
    #     record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
    #
    #     If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding
    #     to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a *group*
    #     of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing
    #     policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate health
    #     checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of
    #     non-alias resource record sets.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   **Geolocation Routing**
    #
    #   For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy,
    #   Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated
    #   geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record
    #   sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States,
    #   for North America, and a resource record set that has `*` for
    #   `CountryCode` is `*`, which applies to all locations. If the
    #   endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53
    #   checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until
    #   it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:
    #
    #   * The United States
    #
    #   * North America
    #
    #   * The default resource record set
    #
    #   **Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name**
    #
    #   If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we
    #   recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint.
    #   For example, create a health check for each `HTTP` server that is
    #   serving content for `www.example.com`. For the value of
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, specify the domain name of the server
    #   (such as `us-east-2-www.example.com`), not the name of the resource
    #   record sets (`www.example.com`).
    #
    #   Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
    #
    #    * Create a health check that has the same value for
    #     `FullyQualifiedDomainName` as the name of a resource record set.
    #
    #   * Associate that health check with the resource record set.

    # @!attribute [rw] ip_address
    #   The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address for the endpoint that you want Amazon

    #   for `IPAddress`, Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the domain
    #   name that you specify in `FullyQualifiedDomainName` at the interval
    #   that you specify in `RequestInterval`. Using an IP address that is
    #   returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.
    #
    #   Use one of the following formats for the value of `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   * **IPv4 address**\: four values between 0 and 255, separated by
    #     periods (.), for example, `192.0.2.44`.
    #
    #   * **IPv6 address**\: eight groups of four hexadecimal values,
    #     separated by colons (:), for example,
    #     `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`. You can also shorten
    #     IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example,
    #     `2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`.
    #
    #   If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an
    #   Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify
    #   the Elastic IP address for `IPAddress`. This ensures that the IP
    #   address of your instance never changes. For more information, see
    #   the applicable documentation:

    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   **If you specify a value for** `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6
    #   address and passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the
    #   `Host` header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This
    #   is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which
    #   you want Route 53 to perform health checks.
    #
    #   When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it
    #   constructs the `Host` header:
    #
    #   * If you specify a value of `80` for `Port` and `HTTP` or
    #     `HTTP_STR_MATCH` for `Type`, Route 53 passes the value of
    #     `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
    #
    #   * If you specify a value of `443` for `Port` and `HTTPS` or
    #     `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` for `Type`, Route 53 passes the value of
    #     `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
    #
    #   * If you specify another value for `Port` and any value except `TCP`
    #     for `Type`, Route 53 passes <i>
    #     <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>\:<code>Port</code> </i> to
    #     the endpoint in the `Host` header.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, Route
    #   53 substitutes the value of `IPAddress` in the `Host` header in each
    #   of the above cases.
    #
    #   **If you don't specify a value for** `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`, Route 53 sends a DNS
    #   request to the domain that you specify in `FullyQualifiedDomainName`
    #   at the interval you specify in `RequestInterval`. Using an IPv4
    #   address that is returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of
    #   the endpoint.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`, Route 53 uses only
    #   IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource
    #   record set with a type of A for the name that you specify for
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, the health check fails with a "DNS
    #   resolution failed" error.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover
    #   resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, we recommend that you create a separate
    #   health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check
    #   for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com.
    #   For the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, specify the domain name
    #   of the server (such as `us-east-2-www.example.com`), not the name of
    #   the resource record sets (www.example.com).
    #
    #   In this configuration, if the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName`
    #   matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate
    #   the health check with those resource record sets, health check
    #   results will be unpredictable.
    #
    #   In addition, if the value of `Type` is `HTTP`, `HTTPS`,
    #   `HTTP_STR_MATCH`, or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH`, Route 53 passes the value of
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header, as it does when you
    #   specify a value for `IPAddress`. If the value of `Type` is `TCP`,
    #   Route 53 doesn't pass a `Host` header.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] search_string
    #   If the value of `Type` is `HTTP_STR_MATCH` or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH`, the
    #   string that you want Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response
    #   body from the specified resource. If the string appears in the
    #   response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy. (You can't
    #   change the value of `Type` when you update a health check.)
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] failure_threshold
    #   The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass
    #   or fail for Amazon Route 53 to change the current status of the
    #   endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more
    #   information, see [How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint
    #   Is Healthy][1] in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for `FailureThreshold`, the default
    #   value is three health checks.

    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] inverted
    #   Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a
    #   health check, for example, to consider a health check unhealthy when
    #   it otherwise would be considered healthy.
    #   @return [Boolean]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] disabled
    #   Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a
    #   health check, here's what happens:
    #
    #   * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53
    #     stops submitting requests to your application, server, or other
    #     resource.
    #
    #   * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the
    #     status of the referenced health checks.
    #
    #   * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops
    #     monitoring the corresponding CloudWatch metrics.
    #
    #   After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of
    #   the health check to always be healthy. If you configured DNS
    #   failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to the corresponding
    #   resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change
    #   the value of [Inverted][1].
    #
    #   Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is
    #   disabled. For more information, see [Amazon Route 53 Pricing][2].

    #   @return [Boolean]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] health_threshold
    #   The number of child health checks that are associated with a
    #   `CALCULATED` health that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for
    #   the `CALCULATED` health check to be considered healthy. To specify
    #   the child health checks that you want to associate with a
    #   `CALCULATED` health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks` and
    #   `ChildHealthCheck` elements.
    #
    #   Note the following:
    #
    #   * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health
    #     checks, Route 53 always considers this health check to be
    #     unhealthy.
    #
    #   * If you specify `0`, Route 53 always considers this health check to
    #     be healthy.
    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] child_health_checks
    #   A complex type that contains one `ChildHealthCheck` element for each
    #   health check that you want to associate with a `CALCULATED` health
    #   check.
    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] enable_sni
    #   Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `client_hello`
    #   message during `TLS` negotiation. This allows the endpoint to
    #   respond to `HTTPS` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS
    #   certificate.
    #
    #   Some endpoints require that HTTPS requests include the host name in
    #   the `client_hello` message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of
    #   the health check will be SSL alert `handshake_failure`. A health
    #   check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is enabled
    #   and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration
    #   on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid.
    #
    #   The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in
    #   the `Common Name` field and possibly several more in the `Subject
    #   Alternative Names` field. One of the domain names in the certificate
    #   should match the value that you specify for
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`. If the endpoint responds to the
    #   `client_hello` message with a certificate that does not include the
    #   domain name that you specified in `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, a
    #   health checker will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the
    #   health checker will omit `FullyQualifiedDomainName` from the
    #   `client_hello` message.
    #   @return [Boolean]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] regions
    #   A complex type that contains one `Region` element for each region
    #   that you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the specified
    #   endpoint from.
    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] alarm_identifier
    #   A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want
    #   Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to determine whether the
    #   specified health check is healthy.
    #   @return [Types::AlarmIdentifier]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] insufficient_data_health_status
    #   When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine
    #   the alarm state, the status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign
    #   to the health check:
    #
    #   * `Healthy`\: Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.
    #
    #   * `Unhealthy`\: Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.
    #
    #   * `LastKnownStatus`\: By default, Route 53 uses the status of the
    #     health check from the last time CloudWatch had sufficient data to
    #     determine the alarm state. For new health checks that have no last
    #     known status, the status for the health check is healthy.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] reset_elements
    #   A complex type that contains one `ResettableElementName` element for
    #   each element that you want to reset to the default value. Valid
    #   values for `ResettableElementName` include the following:
    #
    #   * `ChildHealthChecks`\: Amazon Route 53 resets
    #     [ChildHealthChecks][1] to null.
    #
    #   * `FullyQualifiedDomainName`\: Route 53 resets
    #     [FullyQualifiedDomainName][2]. to null.
    #
    #   * `Regions`\: Route 53 resets the [Regions][3] list to the default
    #     set of regions.
    #
    #   * `ResourcePath`\: Route 53 resets [ResourcePath][4] to null.
