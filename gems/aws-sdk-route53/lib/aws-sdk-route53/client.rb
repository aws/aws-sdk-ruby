    # @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #   Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #   following classes:
    #
    #   * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #     credentials.
    #
    #   * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #     from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #   * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #     shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #   * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #   When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #   locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #   * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #   * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #   * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #   * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #   * `~/.aws/config`
    #   * EC2 IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts are
    #     very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #     `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` to enable retries and extended
    #     timeouts.
    #
    # @option options [required, String] :region
    #   The AWS region to connect to.  The configured `:region` is
    #   used to determine the service `:endpoint`. When not passed,
    #   a default `:region` is search for in the following locations:
    #
    #   * `Aws.config[:region]`
    #   * `ENV['AWS_REGION']`
    #   * `ENV['AMAZON_REGION']`
    #   * `ENV['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION']`
    #   * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #   * `~/.aws/config`
    #
    # @option options [String] :access_key_id
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :convert_params (true)
    #   When `true`, an attempt is made to coerce request parameters into
    #   the required types.
    #
    # @option options [String] :endpoint
    #   The client endpoint is normally constructed from the `:region`
    #   option. You should only configure an `:endpoint` when connecting
    #   to test endpoints. This should be avalid HTTP(S) URI.
    #
    # @option options [Aws::Log::Formatter] :log_formatter (Aws::Log::Formatter.default)
    #   The log formatter.
    #
    # @option options [Symbol] :log_level (:info)
    #   The log level to send messages to the `:logger` at.
    #
    # @option options [Logger] :logger
    #   The Logger instance to send log messages to.  If this option
    #   is not set, logging will be disabled.
    #
    # @option options [String] :profile ("default")
    #   Used when loading credentials from the shared credentials file
    #   at HOME/.aws/credentials.  When not specified, 'default' is used.
    #
    # @option options [Integer] :retry_limit (3)
    #   The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #   ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #   are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #   checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors and auth
    #   errors from expired credentials.
    #
    # @option options [String] :secret_access_key
    #
    # @option options [String] :session_token
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #   Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #   fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #   the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #   {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #   ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #   requests are made, and retries are disabled.

    # Creates, changes, or deletes a resource record set, which contains
    # authoritative DNS information for a specified domain name or subdomain
    # name. For example, you can use `ChangeResourceRecordSets` to create a
    # resource record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web
    # server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44.
    #
    # **Change Batches and Transactional Changes**
    #
    # The request body must include a document with a
    # `ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest` element. The request body contains a
    # list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are
    # considered transactional changes. When using the Amazon Route 53 API
    # to change resource record sets, Amazon Route 53 either makes all or
    # none of the changes in a change batch request. This ensures that
    # Amazon Route 53 never partially implements the intended changes to the
    # resource record sets in a hosted zone.
    #
    # For example, a change batch request that deletes the `CNAME` record
    # for www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for
    # www.example.com. Amazon Route 53 deletes the first resource record set
    # and creates the second resource record set in a single operation. If
    # either the `DELETE` or the `CREATE` action fails, then both changes
    # (plus any other changes in the batch) fail, and the original `CNAME`
    # record continues to exist.
    #
    # Due to the nature of transactional changes, you can't delete the same
    # resource record set more than once in a single change batch. If you
    # attempt to delete the same change batch more than once, Amazon Route
    # 53 returns an `InvalidChangeBatch` error.
    #
    # **Traffic Flow**
    #
    # To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use
    # either the traffic flow visual editor in the Amazon Route 53 console
    # or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances.
    # Save the configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic
    # policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or
    # subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or
    # in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the new
    # configuration isn't performing as expected. For more information, see
    # [Using Traffic Flow to Route DNS Traffic][1] in the *Amazon Route 53
    # Developer Guide*.
    #
    # **Create, Delete, and Upsert**
    #
    # Use `ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest` to perform the following
    # actions:
    #
    # * `CREATE`\: Creates a resource record set that has the specified
    #   values.
    #
    # * `DELETE`\: Deletes an existing resource record set that has the
    #   specified values.
    #
    # * `UPSERT`\: If a resource record set does not already exist, AWS
    #   creates it. If a resource set does exist, Amazon Route 53 updates it
    #   with the values in the request.
    #
    # **Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets**
    #
    # The syntax for a request depends on the type of resource record set
    # that you want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias,
    # or failover. The XML elements in your request must appear in the order
    # listed in the syntax.
    #
    # For an example for each type of resource record set, see "Examples."
    #
    # Don't refer to the syntax in the "Parameter Syntax" section, which
    # includes all of the elements for every kind of resource record set
    # that you can create, delete, or update by using
    # `ChangeResourceRecordSets`.
    #
    # **Change Propagation to Amazon Route 53 DNS Servers**
    #
    # When you submit a `ChangeResourceRecordSets` request, Amazon Route 53
    # propagates your changes to all of the Amazon Route 53 authoritative
    # DNS servers. While your changes are propagating, `GetChange` returns a
    # status of `PENDING`. When propagation is complete, `GetChange` returns
    # a status of `INSYNC`. Changes generally propagate to all Amazon Route
    # 53 name servers within 60 seconds. For more information, see
    # GetChange.
    #
    # **Limits on ChangeResourceRecordSets Requests**
    #
    # For information about the limits on a `ChangeResourceRecordSets`
    # request, see [Limits][2] in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

    # **ELB Load Balancers**
    #
    # If you're registering EC2 instances with an Elastic Load Balancing
    # (ELB) load balancer, do not create Amazon Route 53 health checks for
    # the EC2 instances. When you register an EC2 instance with a load
    # balancer, you configure settings for an ELB health check, which
    # performs a similar function to an Amazon Route 53 health check.
    #
    # **Private Hosted Zones**
    #
    # You can associate health checks with failover resource record sets in
    # a private hosted zone. Note the following:
    #
    # * Amazon Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the
    #   health of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a
    #   public IP address to the instance in the VPC.
    #
    # * You can configure a health checker to check the health of an
    #   external resource that the instance relies on, such as a database
    #   server.
    #
    # * You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the
    #   metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of
    #   the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that
    #   checks the status of the Amazon EC2 `StatusCheckFailed` metric, add
    #   an alarm to the metric, and then create a health check that is based
    #   on the state of the alarm. For information about creating CloudWatch
    #   metrics and alarms by using the CloudWatch console, see the [Amazon
    #   CloudWatch User Guide][1].

    #     `CallerReference` and settings as a previous request, and if the
    #     health check doesn't exist, Amazon Route 53 creates the health
    #     check. If the health check does exist, Amazon Route 53 returns the
    #     settings for the existing health check.
    #
    #   * If you send a `CreateHealthCheck` request with the same
    #     `CallerReference` as a deleted health check, regardless of the
    #     settings, Amazon Route 53 returns a `HealthCheckAlreadyExists`
    #     error.
    #
    #   * If you send a `CreateHealthCheck` request with the same

    # Creates a new public hosted zone, which you use to specify how the
    # Domain Name System (DNS) routes traffic on the Internet for a domain,
    # such as example.com, and its subdomains.
    #
    # You can't convert a public hosted zones to a private hosted zone or
    # vice versa. Instead, you must create a new hosted zone with the same
    # name and create new resource record sets.
    #
    # For more information about charges for hosted zones, see [Amazon Route
    # 53 Pricing][1].
    #
    # Note the following:
    #
    # * You can't create a hosted zone for a top-level domain (TLD).
    #
    # * Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a default SOA record and four
    #   NS records for the zone. For more information about SOA and NS
    #   records, see [NS and SOA Records that Amazon Route 53 Creates for a
    #   Hosted Zone][2] in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   If you want to use the same name servers for multiple hosted zones,
    #   you can optionally associate a reusable delegation set with the
    #   hosted zone. See the `DelegationSetId` element.
    #
    # * If your domain is registered with a registrar other than Amazon
    #   Route 53, you must update the name servers with your registrar to
    #   make Amazon Route 53 your DNS service. For more information, see
    #   [Configuring Amazon Route 53 as your DNS Service][3] in the *Amazon
    #   Route 53 Developer Guide*.
    #
    # When you submit a `CreateHostedZone` request, the initial status of
    # the hosted zone is `PENDING`. This means that the NS and SOA records
    # are not yet available on all Amazon Route 53 DNS servers. When the NS
    # and SOA records are available, the status of the zone changes to
    # `INSYNC`.

    # [3]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/creating-migrating.html
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :name
    #   The name of the domain. For resource record types that include a
    #   domain name, specify a fully qualified domain name, for example,
    #   *www.example.com*. The trailing dot is optional; Amazon Route 53
    #   assumes that the domain name is fully qualified. This means that
    #   Amazon Route 53 treats *www.example.com* (without a trailing dot) and
    #   *www.example.com.* (with a trailing dot) as identical.
    #
    #   If you're creating a public hosted zone, this is the name you have
    #   registered with your DNS registrar. If your domain name is registered
    #   with a registrar other than Amazon Route 53, change the name servers
    #   for your domain to the set of `NameServers` that `CreateHostedZone`
    #   returns in `DelegationSet`.
    #
    # @option params [Types::VPC] :vpc
    #   (Private hosted zones only) A complex type that contains information
    #   about the Amazon VPC that you're associating with this hosted zone.
    #
    #   You can specify only one Amazon VPC when you create a private hosted
    #   zone. To associate additional Amazon VPCs with the hosted zone, use
    #   AssociateVPCWithHostedZone after you create a hosted zone.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :caller_reference
    #   A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed
    #   `CreateHostedZone` requests to be retried without the risk of
    #   executing the operation twice. You must use a unique `CallerReference`
    #   string every time you submit a `CreateHostedZone` request.
    #   `CallerReference` can be any unique string, for example, a date/time
    #   stamp.
    #
    # @option params [Types::HostedZoneConfig] :hosted_zone_config
    #   (Optional) A complex type that contains the following optional values:
    #
    #   * For public and private hosted zones, an optional comment
    #
    #   * For private hosted zones, an optional `PrivateZone` element
    #
    #   If you don't specify a comment or the `PrivateZone` element, omit
    #   `HostedZoneConfig` and the other elements.
    #
    # @option params [String] :delegation_set_id
    #   If you want to associate a reusable delegation set with this hosted
    #   zone, the ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the reusable delegation
    #   set when you created it. For more information about reusable
    #   delegation sets, see CreateReusableDelegationSet.

    # For more information about updating health checks, see [Creating,

    # Developer Guide*.
    #
    #
    #
    # [1]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/health-checks-creating-deleting.html
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :health_check_id
    #   The ID for the health check for which you want detailed information.
    #   When you created the health check, `CreateHealthCheck` returned the ID
    #   in the response, in the `HealthCheckId` element.
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :health_check_version
    #   A sequential counter that Amazon Route 53 sets to `1` when you create
    #   a health check and increments by 1 each time you update settings for
    #   the health check.
    #
    #   We recommend that you use `GetHealthCheck` or `ListHealthChecks` to
    #   get the current value of `HealthCheckVersion` for the health check
    #   that you want to update, and that you include that value in your
    #   `UpdateHealthCheck` request. This prevents Amazon Route 53 from
    #   overwriting an intervening update:
    #
    #   * If the value in the `UpdateHealthCheck` request matches the value of
    #     `HealthCheckVersion` in the health check, Amazon Route 53 updates
    #     the health check with the new settings.
    #
    #   * If the value of `HealthCheckVersion` in the health check is greater,
    #     the health check was changed after you got the version number.
    #     Amazon Route 53 does not update the health check, and it returns a
    #     `HealthCheckVersionMismatch` error.
    #
    # @option params [String] :ip_address
    #   The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address for the endpoint that you want Amazon
    #   Route 53 to perform health checks on. If you don't specify a value
    #   for `IPAddress`, Amazon Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the
    #   domain name that you specify in `FullyQualifiedDomainName` at the
    #   interval that you specify in `RequestInterval`. Using an IP address
    #   that is returned by DNS, Amazon Route 53 then checks the health of the
    #   endpoint.
    #
    #   Use one of the following formats for the value of `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   * **IPv4 address**\: four values between 0 and 255, separated by
    #     periods (.), for example, `192.0.2.44`.
    #
    #   * **IPv6 address**\: eight groups of four hexadecimal values,
    #     separated by colons (:), for example,
    #     `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`. You can also shorten IPv6
    #     addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example,
    #     `2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`.
    #
    #   If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an
    #   Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify
    #   the Elastic IP address for `IPAddress`. This ensures that the IP
    #   address of your instance never changes. For more information, see the
    #   applicable documentation:
    #
    #   * Linux: [Elastic IP Addresses (EIP)][1] in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide
    #     for Linux Instances*
    #
    #   * Windows: [Elastic IP Addresses (EIP)][2] in the *Amazon EC2 User
    #     Guide for Windows Instances*
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If a health check already has a value for `IPAddress`, you can change
    #   the value. However, you can't update an existing health check to add
    #   or remove the value of `IPAddress`.

    #   For more information, see
    #   UpdateHealthCheckRequest$FullyQualifiedDomainName.
    #
    #   Constraints: Amazon Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for
    #   which the IP address is in local, private, non-routable, or multicast
    #   ranges. For more information about IP addresses for which you can't
    #   create health checks, see the following documents:

    #   The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform

    #
    # @option params [String] :resource_path
    #   The path that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing

    #   return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy,
    #   for example the file /docs/route53-health-check.html.
    #
    #   Specify this value only if you want to change it.
    #
    # @option params [String] :fully_qualified_domain_name
    #   Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for
    #   `IPAddress`.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If a health check already has a value for `IPAddress`, you can change
    #   the value. However, you can't update an existing health check to add
    #   or remove the value of `IPAddress`.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   **If you specify a value for** `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or
    #   IPv6 address and passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the
    #   `Host` header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is
    #   typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you
    #   want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks.
    #
    #   When Amazon Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it
    #   constructs the `Host` header:
    #
    #   * If you specify a value of `80` for `Port` and `HTTP` or
    #     `HTTP_STR_MATCH` for `Type`, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of
    #     `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
    #
    #   * If you specify a value of `443` for `Port` and `HTTPS` or
    #     `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` for `Type`, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of
    #     `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
    #
    #   * If you specify another value for `Port` and any value except `TCP`
    #     for `Type`, Amazon Route 53 passes <i>
    #     <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>\:<code>Port</code> </i> to the
    #     endpoint in the `Host` header.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, Amazon
    #   Route 53 substitutes the value of `IPAddress` in the `Host` header in
    #   each of the above cases.
    #
    #   **If you don't specify a value for** `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`, Amazon Route 53 sends a
    #   DNS request to the domain that you specify in
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName` at the interval you specify in
    #   `RequestInterval`. Using an IPv4 address that is returned by DNS,
    #   Amazon Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`, Amazon Route 53 uses
    #   only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no
    #   resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify for
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, the health check fails with a "DNS
    #   resolution failed" error.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover
    #   resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, we recommend that you create a separate
    #   health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for
    #   each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the
    #   value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, specify the domain name of the
    #   server (such as `us-east-2-www.example.com`), not the name of the
    #   resource record sets (www.example.com).
    #
    #   In this configuration, if the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName`
    #   matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate
    #   the health check with those resource record sets, health check results
    #   will be unpredictable.
    #
    #   In addition, if the value of `Type` is `HTTP`, `HTTPS`,
    #   `HTTP_STR_MATCH`, or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH`, Amazon Route 53 passes the
    #   value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header, as it does
    #   when you specify a value for `IPAddress`. If the value of `Type` is
    #   `TCP`, Amazon Route 53 doesn't pass a `Host` header.
    #
    # @option params [String] :search_string
    #   If the value of `Type` is `HTTP_STR_MATCH` or `HTTP_STR_MATCH`, the
    #   string that you want Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response
    #   body from the specified resource. If the string appears in the
    #   response body, Amazon Route 53 considers the resource healthy. (You
    #   can't change the value of `Type` when you update a health check.)
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :failure_threshold
    #   The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or
    #   fail for Amazon Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint
    #   from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more information, see
    #   [How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy][1] in
    #   the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for `FailureThreshold`, the default
    #   value is three health checks.
    #

    #   [1]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html
    #
    # @option params [Boolean] :inverted
    #   Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a
    #   health check, for example, to consider a health check unhealthy when
    #   it otherwise would be considered healthy.
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :health_threshold
    #   The number of child health checks that are associated with a
    #   `CALCULATED` health that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the
    #   `CALCULATED` health check to be considered healthy. To specify the
    #   child health checks that you want to associate with a `CALCULATED`
    #   health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks` and `ChildHealthCheck`
    #   elements.
    #
    #   Note the following:
    #
    #   * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health
    #     checks, Amazon Route 53 always considers this health check to be
    #     unhealthy.
    #
    #   * If you specify `0`, Amazon Route 53 always considers this health
    #     check to be healthy.
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :child_health_checks
    #   A complex type that contains one `ChildHealthCheck` element for each
    #   health check that you want to associate with a `CALCULATED` health
    #   check.
    #
    # @option params [Boolean] :enable_sni
    #   Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `client_hello`
    #   message during `TLS` negotiation. This allows the endpoint to respond
    #   to `HTTPS` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS
    #   certificate.
    #
    #   Some endpoints require that HTTPS requests include the host name in
    #   the `client_hello` message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of
    #   the health check will be SSL alert `handshake_failure`. A health check
    #   can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is enabled and
    #   you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on
    #   your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid.
    #
    #   The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the
    #   `Common Name` field and possibly several more in the `Subject
    #   Alternative Names` field. One of the domain names in the certificate
    #   should match the value that you specify for
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`. If the endpoint responds to the
    #   `client_hello` message with a certificate that does not include the
    #   domain name that you specified in `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, a health
    #   checker will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health
    #   checker will omit `FullyQualifiedDomainName` from the `client_hello`
    #   message.
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :regions
    #   A complex type that contains one `Region` element for each region that
    #   you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the specified
    #   endpoint from.
    #
    # @option params [Types::AlarmIdentifier] :alarm_identifier
    #   A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want
    #   Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to determine whether this
    #   health check is healthy.
    #
    # @option params [String] :insufficient_data_health_status
    #   When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine
    #   the alarm state, the status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to
    #   the health check:
    #
    #   * `Healthy`\: Amazon Route 53 considers the health check to be
    #     healthy.
    #
    #   * `Unhealthy`\: Amazon Route 53 considers the health check to be
    #     unhealthy.
    #
    #   * `LastKnownStatus`\: Amazon Route 53 uses the status of the health
    #     check from the last time CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine
    #     the alarm state. For new health checks that have no last known
    #     status, the default status for the health check is healthy.
    #

    # Polls an API operation until a resource enters a desired state.
    #
    # ## Basic Usage
    #
    # A waiter will call an API operation until:
    #
    # * It is successful
    # * It enters a terminal state
    # * It makes the maximum number of attempts
    #
    # In between attempts, the waiter will sleep.
    #
    #     # polls in a loop, sleeping between attempts
    #     client.waiter_until(waiter_name, params)
    #
    # ## Configuration
    #
    # You can configure the maximum number of polling attempts, and the
    # delay (in seconds) between each polling attempt. You can pass
    # configuration as the final arguments hash.
    #
    #     # poll for ~25 seconds
    #     client.wait_until(waiter_name, params, {
    #       max_attempts: 5,
    #       delay: 5,
    #     })
    #
    # ## Callbacks
    #
    # You can be notified before each polling attempt and before each
    # delay. If you throw `:success` or `:failure` from these callbacks,
    # it will terminate the waiter.
    #
    #     started_at = Time.now
    #     client.wait_until(waiter_name, params, {
    #
    #       # disable max attempts
    #       max_attempts: nil,
    #
    #       # poll for 1 hour, instead of a number of attempts
    #       before_wait: -> (attempts, response) do
    #         throw :failure if Time.now - started_at > 3600
    #       end
    #     })
    #
    # ## Handling Errors
    #
    # When a waiter is unsuccessful, it will raise an error.
    # All of the failure errors extend from
    # {Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed}.
    #
    #     begin
    #       client.wait_until(...)
    #     rescue Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed
    #       # resource did not enter the desired state in time
    #     end
    #
    # ## Valid Waiters
    #
    # The following table lists the valid waiter names, the operations they call,
    # and the default `:delay` and `:max_attempts` values.
    #
    # | waiter_name                  | params        | :delay   | :max_attempts |
    # | ---------------------------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------- |
    # | resource_record_sets_changed | {#get_change} | 30       | 60            |
    #
    # @raise [Errors::FailureStateError] Raised when the waiter terminates
    #   because the waiter has entered a state that it will not transition
    #   out of, preventing success.
    #
    # @raise [Errors::TooManyAttemptsError] Raised when the configured
    #   maximum number of attempts have been made, and the waiter is not
    #   yet successful.
    #
    # @raise [Errors::UnexpectedError] Raised when an error is encounted
