    # @overload initialize(options)
    #   @param [Hash] options
    #   @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #     Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #     following classes:
    #
    #     * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #       credentials.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading static credentials from a
    #       shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #     * `Aws::AssumeRoleWebIdentityCredentials` - Used when you need to
    #       assume a role after providing credentials via the web.
    #
    #     * `Aws::SSOCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from AWS SSO using an
    #       access token generated from `aws login`.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ProcessCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #       process that outputs to stdout.
    #
    #     * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #     * `Aws::ECSCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from
    #       instances running in ECS.
    #
    #     * `Aws::CognitoIdentityCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #       from the Cognito Identity service.
    #
    #     When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #     locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #     * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #     * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #     * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #     * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #     * `~/.aws/config`
    #     * EC2/ECS IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts
    #       are very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of

    #     An integer representing the maximum number attempts that will be made for
    #     a single request, including the initial attempt.  For example,
    #     setting this value to 5 will result in a request being retried up to
    #     4 times. Used in `standard` and `adaptive` retry modes.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :profile ("default")
    #     Used when loading credentials from the shared credentials file

    #     are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #     checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors, auth errors,
    #     endpoint discovery, and errors from expired credentials.
    #     This option is only used in the `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :retry_max_delay (0)
    #     The maximum number of seconds to delay between retries (0 for no limit)
    #     used by the default backoff function. This option is only used in the
    #     `legacy` retry mode.
    #
    #   @option options [String] :retry_mode ("legacy")
    #     Specifies which retry algorithm to use. Values are:
    #

    #       no retry mode is provided.
    #
    #     * `standard` - A standardized set of retry rules across the AWS SDKs.
    #       This includes support for retry quotas, which limit the number of
    #       unsuccessful retries a client can make.
    #
    #     * `adaptive` - An experimental retry mode that includes all the
    #       functionality of `standard` mode along with automatic client side
    #       throttling.  This is a provisional mode that may change behavior

    #   @option options [String] :session_token
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #     Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #     fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #     the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #     {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #     ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #     requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    #   @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)

    #     `Timeout::Error`.
    #
    #   @option options [Integer] :http_read_timeout (60) The default
    #     number of seconds to wait for response data.  This value can
    #     safely be set per-request on the session.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_idle_timeout (5) The number of
    #     seconds a connection is allowed to sit idle before it is
    #     considered stale.  Stale connections are closed and removed
    #     from the pool before making a request.
    #
    #   @option options [Float] :http_continue_timeout (1) The number of
    #     seconds to wait for a 100-continue response before sending the
    #     request body.  This option has no effect unless the request has
    #     "Expect" header set to "100-continue".  Defaults to `nil` which
    #     disables this behaviour.  This value can safely be set per
    #     request on the session.

    # Creates, changes, or deletes a resource record set, which contains
    # authoritative DNS information for a specified domain name or subdomain
    # name. For example, you can use `ChangeResourceRecordSets` to create a
    # resource record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web
    # server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44.
    #
    # **Deleting Resource Record Sets**
    #
    # To delete a resource record set, you must specify all the same values
    # that you specified when you created it.
    #
    # **Change Batches and Transactional Changes**
    #
    # The request body must include a document with a
    # `ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest` element. The request body contains a
    # list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are
    # considered transactional changes. Route 53 validates the changes in
    # the request and then either makes all or none of the changes in the
    # change batch request. This ensures that DNS routing isn't adversely
    # affected by partial changes to the resource record sets in a hosted
    # zone.
    #
    # For example, suppose a change batch request contains two changes: it
    # deletes the `CNAME` resource record set for www.example.com and
    # creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. If
    # validation for both records succeeds, Route 53 deletes the first
    # resource record set and creates the second resource record set in a
    # single operation. If validation for either the `DELETE` or the
    # `CREATE` action fails, then the request is canceled, and the original
    # `CNAME` record continues to exist.
    #
    # <note markdown="1"> If you try to delete the same resource record set more than once in a
    # single change batch, Route 53 returns an `InvalidChangeBatch` error.
    #
    #  </note>
    #
    # **Traffic Flow**
    #
    # To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use
    # either the traffic flow visual editor in the Route 53 console or the
    # API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save
    # the configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic
    # policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or
    # subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or
    # in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the new
    # configuration isn't performing as expected. For more information, see
    # [Using Traffic Flow to Route DNS Traffic][1] in the *Amazon Route 53
    # Developer Guide*.
    #
    # **Create, Delete, and Upsert**
    #
    # Use `ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest` to perform the following
    # actions:
    #
    # * `CREATE`\: Creates a resource record set that has the specified
    #   values.
    #
    # * `DELETE`\: Deletes an existing resource record set that has the
    #   specified values.
    #
    # * `UPSERT`\: If a resource record set does not already exist, AWS
    #   creates it. If a resource set does exist, Route 53 updates it with
    #   the values in the request.
    #
    # **Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets**
    #
    # The syntax for a request depends on the type of resource record set
    # that you want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias,
    # or failover. The XML elements in your request must appear in the order
    # listed in the syntax.
    #
    # For an example for each type of resource record set, see "Examples."
    #
    # Don't refer to the syntax in the "Parameter Syntax" section, which
    # includes all of the elements for every kind of resource record set
    # that you can create, delete, or update by using
    # `ChangeResourceRecordSets`.
    #
    # **Change Propagation to Route 53 DNS Servers**
    #
    # When you submit a `ChangeResourceRecordSets` request, Route 53
    # propagates your changes to all of the Route 53 authoritative DNS
    # servers. While your changes are propagating, `GetChange` returns a
    # status of `PENDING`. When propagation is complete, `GetChange` returns
    # a status of `INSYNC`. Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 name
    # servers within 60 seconds. For more information, see [GetChange][2].
    #
    # **Limits on ChangeResourceRecordSets Requests**
    #
    # For information about the limits on a `ChangeResourceRecordSets`
    # request, see [Limits][3] in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

    # You can associate health checks with failover resource record sets in
    # a private hosted zone. Note the following:
    #
    # * Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of
    #   an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public IP
    #   address to the instance in the VPC.
    #
    # * You can configure a health checker to check the health of an
    #   external resource that the instance relies on, such as a database
    #   server.
    #
    # * You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the
    #   metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of
    #   the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that
    #   checks the status of the Amazon EC2 `StatusCheckFailed` metric, add
    #   an alarm to the metric, and then create a health check that is based
    #   on the state of the alarm. For information about creating CloudWatch
    #   metrics and alarms by using the CloudWatch console, see the [Amazon
    #   CloudWatch User Guide][3].

    # @option params [required, String] :caller_reference
    #   A unique string that identifies the request and that allows you to
    #   retry a failed `CreateHealthCheck` request without the risk of
    #   creating two identical health checks:
    #
    #   * If you send a `CreateHealthCheck` request with the same
    #     `CallerReference` and settings as a previous request, and if the
    #     health check doesn't exist, Amazon Route 53 creates the health
    #     check. If the health check does exist, Route 53 returns the settings
    #     for the existing health check.
    #
    #   * If you send a `CreateHealthCheck` request with the same
    #     `CallerReference` as a deleted health check, regardless of the
    #     settings, Route 53 returns a `HealthCheckAlreadyExists` error.
    #
    #   * If you send a `CreateHealthCheck` request with the same
    #     `CallerReference` as an existing health check but with different
    #     settings, Route 53 returns a `HealthCheckAlreadyExists` error.
    #
    #   * If you send a `CreateHealthCheck` request with a unique
    #     `CallerReference` but settings identical to an existing health
    #     check, Route 53 creates the health check.

    # Creates a new public or private hosted zone. You create records in a
    # public hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic on the
    # internet for a domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains
    # (apex.example.com, acme.example.com). You create records in a private
    # hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic for a domain and
    # its subdomains within one or more Amazon Virtual Private Clouds
    # (Amazon VPCs).
    #
    # You can't convert a public hosted zone to a private hosted zone or
    # vice versa. Instead, you must create a new hosted zone with the same
    # name and create new resource record sets.
    #
    # For more information about charges for hosted zones, see [Amazon Route
    # 53 Pricing][1].
    #
    # Note the following:
    #
    # * You can't create a hosted zone for a top-level domain (TLD) such as
    #   .com.
    #
    # * For public hosted zones, Route 53 automatically creates a default
    #   SOA record and four NS records for the zone. For more information
    #   about SOA and NS records, see [NS and SOA Records that Route 53
    #   Creates for a Hosted Zone][2] in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer
    #   Guide*.
    #
    #   If you want to use the same name servers for multiple public hosted
    #   zones, you can optionally associate a reusable delegation set with
    #   the hosted zone. See the `DelegationSetId` element.
    #
    # * If your domain is registered with a registrar other than Route 53,
    #   you must update the name servers with your registrar to make Route
    #   53 the DNS service for the domain. For more information, see
    #   [Migrating DNS Service for an Existing Domain to Amazon Route 53][3]
    #   in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.
    #
    # When you submit a `CreateHostedZone` request, the initial status of
    # the hosted zone is `PENDING`. For public hosted zones, this means that
    # the NS and SOA records are not yet available on all Route 53 DNS
    # servers. When the NS and SOA records are available, the status of the
    # zone changes to `INSYNC`.

    # @option params [required, String] :name
    #   The name of the domain. Specify a fully qualified domain name, for
    #   example, *www.example.com*. The trailing dot is optional; Amazon Route
    #   53 assumes that the domain name is fully qualified. This means that
    #   Route 53 treats *www.example.com* (without a trailing dot) and
    #   *www.example.com.* (with a trailing dot) as identical.
    #
    #   If you're creating a public hosted zone, this is the name you have
    #   registered with your DNS registrar. If your domain name is registered
    #   with a registrar other than Route 53, change the name servers for your
    #   domain to the set of `NameServers` that `CreateHostedZone` returns in
    #   `DelegationSet`.

    #   (Private hosted zones only) A complex type that contains information
    #   about the Amazon VPC that you're associating with this hosted zone.
    #
    #   You can specify only one Amazon VPC when you create a private hosted
    #   zone. To associate additional Amazon VPCs with the hosted zone, use
    #   [AssociateVPCWithHostedZone][1] after you create a hosted zone.

    #   string every time you submit a `CreateHostedZone` request.
    #   `CallerReference` can be any unique string, for example, a date/time
    #   stamp.

    # Creates a configuration for DNS query logging. After you create a
    # query logging configuration, Amazon Route 53 begins to publish log
    # data to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.
    #
    # DNS query logs contain information about the queries that Route 53
    # receives for a specified public hosted zone, such as the following:
    #
    # * Route 53 edge location that responded to the DNS query
    #
    # * Domain or subdomain that was requested
    #
    # * DNS record type, such as A or AAAA
    #
    # * DNS response code, such as `NoError` or `ServFail`
    #
    # Log Group and Resource Policy
    #
    # : Before you create a query logging configuration, perform the
    #   following operations.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53
    #   console, Route 53 performs these operations automatically.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   1.  Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the ARN,
    #       which you specify when you create a query logging configuration.
    #       Note the following:
    #
    #       * You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region.
    #
    #       * You must use the same AWS account to create the log group and
    #         the hosted zone that you want to configure query logging for.
    #
    #       * When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend
    #         that you use a consistent prefix, for example:
    #
    #         `/aws/route53/hosted zone name `
    #
    #         In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which
    #         controls access to one or more log groups and the associated
    #         AWS resources, such as Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit
    #         on the number of resource policies that you can create, so we
    #         recommend that you use a consistent prefix so you can use the
    #         same resource policy for all the log groups that you create
    #         for query logging.
    #
    #   2.  Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the
    #       permissions that Route 53 needs to create log streams and to
    #       send query logs to log streams. For the value of `Resource`,
    #       specify the ARN for the log group that you created in the
    #       previous step. To use the same resource policy for all the
    #       CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for query logging
    #       configurations, replace the hosted zone name with `*`, for
    #       example:
    #
    #       `arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/*`
    #
    #       <note markdown="1"> You can't use the CloudWatch console to create or edit a
    #       resource policy. You must use the CloudWatch API, one of the AWS
    #       SDKs, or the AWS CLI.
    #
    #        </note>
    #
    # Log Streams and Edge Locations
    #
    # : When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for DNS query
    #   logging, it does the following:
    #
    #   * Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the
    #     edge location responds to DNS queries for the specified hosted
    #     zone. That log stream is used to log all queries that Route 53
    #     responds to for that edge location.
    #
    #   * Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream.
    #
    #   The name of each log stream is in the following format:
    #
    #   ` hosted zone ID/edge location code `
    #
    #   The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily
    #   assigned number, for example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically
    #   corresponds with the International Air Transport Association airport
    #   code for an airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations
    #   might change in the future.) For a list of edge locations, see "The
    #   Route 53 Global Network" on the [Route 53 Product Details][1] page.
    #
    # Queries That Are Logged
    #
    # : Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers forward to
    #   Route 53. If a DNS resolver has already cached the response to a
    #   query (such as the IP address for a load balancer for example.com),
    #   the resolver will continue to return the cached response. It
    #   doesn't forward another query to Route 53 until the TTL for the
    #   corresponding resource record set expires. Depending on how many DNS
    #   queries are submitted for a resource record set, and depending on
    #   the TTL for that resource record set, query logs might contain
    #   information about only one query out of every several thousand
    #   queries that are submitted to DNS. For more information about how
    #   DNS works, see [Routing Internet Traffic to Your Website or Web
    #   Application][2] in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.
    #
    # Log File Format
    #
    # : For a list of the values in each query log and the format of each
    #   value, see [Logging DNS Queries][3] in the *Amazon Route 53
    #   Developer Guide*.
    #

    #
    # You can also create a reusable delegation set that uses the four name
    # servers that are associated with an existing hosted zone. Specify the
    # hosted zone ID in the `CreateReusableDelegationSet` request.

    #
    # For information about using a reusable delegation set to configure
    # white label name servers, see [Configuring White Label Name
    # Servers][1].
    #
    # The process for migrating existing hosted zones to use a reusable
    # delegation set is comparable to the process for configuring white
    # label name servers. You need to perform the following steps:
    #
    # 1.  Create a reusable delegation set.
    #
    # 2.  Recreate hosted zones, and reduce the TTL to 60 seconds or less.
    #
    # 3.  Recreate resource record sets in the new hosted zones.
    #
    # 4.  Change the registrar's name servers to use the name servers for
    #     the new hosted zones.
    #
    # 5.  Monitor traffic for the website or application.
    #
    # 6.  Change TTLs back to their original values.
    #
    # If you want to migrate existing hosted zones to use a reusable
    # delegation set, the existing hosted zones can't use any of the name
    # servers that are assigned to the reusable delegation set. If one or
    # more hosted zones do use one or more name servers that are assigned to
    # the reusable delegation set, you can do one of the following:
    #
    # * For small numbers of hosted zones—up to a few hundred—it's
    #   relatively easy to create reusable delegation sets until you get one
    #   that has four name servers that don't overlap with any of the name
    #   servers in your hosted zones.
    #
    # * For larger numbers of hosted zones, the easiest solution is to use
    #   more than one reusable delegation set.
    #
    # * For larger numbers of hosted zones, you can also migrate hosted
    #   zones that have overlapping name servers to hosted zones that don't
    #   have overlapping name servers, then migrate the hosted zones again
    #   to use the reusable delegation set.

    # Deletes a hosted zone.
    #
    # If the hosted zone was created by another service, such as AWS Cloud
    # Map, see [Deleting Public Hosted Zones That Were Created by Another
    # Service][1] in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* for information
    # about how to delete it. (The process is the same for public and
    # private hosted zones that were created by another service.)
    #
    # If you want to keep your domain registration but you want to stop
    # routing internet traffic to your website or web application, we
    # recommend that you delete resource record sets in the hosted zone
    # instead of deleting the hosted zone.
    #
    # If you delete a hosted zone, you can't undelete it. You must create a
    # new hosted zone and update the name servers for your domain
    # registration, which can require up to 48 hours to take effect. (If you
    # delegated responsibility for a subdomain to a hosted zone and you
    # delete the child hosted zone, you must update the name servers in the
    # parent hosted zone.) In addition, if you delete a hosted zone, someone
    # could hijack the domain and route traffic to their own resources using
    # your domain name.
    #
    # If you want to avoid the monthly charge for the hosted zone, you can
    # transfer DNS service for the domain to a free DNS service. When you
    # transfer DNS service, you have to update the name servers for the
    # domain registration. If the domain is registered with Route 53, see
    # [UpdateDomainNameservers][2] for information about how to replace
    # Route 53 name servers with name servers for the new DNS service. If
    # the domain is registered with another registrar, use the method
    # provided by the registrar to update name servers for the domain
    # registration. For more information, perform an internet search on
    # "free DNS service."
    #
    # You can delete a hosted zone only if it contains only the default SOA
    # record and NS resource record sets. If the hosted zone contains other
    # resource record sets, you must delete them before you can delete the
    # hosted zone. If you try to delete a hosted zone that contains other
    # resource record sets, the request fails, and Route 53 returns a
    # `HostedZoneNotEmpty` error. For information about deleting records
    # from your hosted zone, see [ChangeResourceRecordSets][3].
    #
    # To verify that the hosted zone has been deleted, do one of the
    # following:

    # Lists the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone.
    #
    # `ListResourceRecordSets` returns up to 100 resource record sets at a
    # time in ASCII order, beginning at a position specified by the `name`
    # and `type` elements.
    #
    # **Sort order**
    #
    # `ListResourceRecordSets` sorts results first by DNS name with the
    # labels reversed, for example:
    #
    # `com.example.www.`
    #
    # Note the trailing dot, which can change the sort order when the record
    # name contains characters that appear before `.` (decimal 46) in the
    # ASCII table. These characters include the following: `! " # $ % & ' (
    # ) * + , -`
    #
    # When multiple records have the same DNS name, `ListResourceRecordSets`
    # sorts results by the record type.
    #
    # **Specifying where to start listing records**
    #
    # You can use the name and type elements to specify the resource record
    # set that the list begins with:
    #
    # If you do not specify Name or Type
    #
    # : The results begin with the first resource record set that the hosted
    #   zone contains.
    #
    # If you specify Name but not Type
    #
    # : The results begin with the first resource record set in the list
    #   whose name is greater than or equal to `Name`.
    #
    # If you specify Type but not Name
    #
    # : Amazon Route 53 returns the `InvalidInput` error.
    #
    # If you specify both Name and Type
    #
    # : The results begin with the first resource record set in the list
    #   whose name is greater than or equal to `Name`, and whose type is
    #   greater than or equal to `Type`.
    #
    # **Resource record sets that are PENDING**
    #
    # This action returns the most current version of the records. This
    # includes records that are `PENDING`, and that are not yet available on
    # all Route 53 DNS servers.
    #
    # **Changing resource record sets**
    #
    # To ensure that you get an accurate listing of the resource record sets
    # for a hosted zone at a point in time, do not submit a
    # `ChangeResourceRecordSets` request while you're paging through the
    # results of a `ListResourceRecordSets` request. If you do, some pages
    # may display results without the latest changes while other pages
    # display results with the latest changes.
    #
    # **Displaying the next page of results**
    #
    # If a `ListResourceRecordSets` command returns more than one page of
    # results, the value of `IsTruncated` is `true`. To display the next
    # page of results, get the values of `NextRecordName`, `NextRecordType`,
    # and `NextRecordIdentifier` (if any) from the response. Then submit
    # another `ListResourceRecordSets` request, and specify those values for
    # `StartRecordName`, `StartRecordType`, and `StartRecordIdentifier`.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :hosted_zone_id
    #   The ID of the hosted zone that contains the resource record sets that
    #   you want to list.
    #
    # @option params [String] :start_record_name
    #   The first name in the lexicographic ordering of resource record sets
    #   that you want to list. If the specified record name doesn't exist,
    #   the results begin with the first resource record set that has a name
    #   greater than the value of `name`.
    #
    # @option params [String] :start_record_type
    #   The type of resource record set to begin the record listing from.
    #
    #   Valid values for basic resource record sets: `A` \| `AAAA` \| `CAA` \|
    #   `CNAME` \| `MX` \| `NAPTR` \| `NS` \| `PTR` \| `SOA` \| `SPF` \| `SRV`
    #   \| `TXT`
    #
    #   Values for weighted, latency, geolocation, and failover resource
    #   record sets: `A` \| `AAAA` \| `CAA` \| `CNAME` \| `MX` \| `NAPTR` \|
    #   `PTR` \| `SPF` \| `SRV` \| `TXT`
    #
    #   Values for alias resource record sets:
    #
    #   * **API Gateway custom regional API or edge-optimized API**\: A
    #
    #   * **CloudFront distribution**\: A or AAAA
    #
    #   * **Elastic Beanstalk environment that has a regionalized
    #     subdomain**\: A
    #
    #   * **Elastic Load Balancing load balancer**\: A \| AAAA
    #
    #   * **S3 bucket**\: A
    #
    #   * **VPC interface VPC endpoint**\: A
    #
    #   * **Another resource record set in this hosted zone:** The type of the
    #     resource record set that the alias references.
    #
    #   Constraint: Specifying `type` without specifying `name` returns an
    #   `InvalidInput` error.

    # Developer Guide*.

    # [1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/health-checks-creating-deleting.html
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :health_check_id
    #   The ID for the health check for which you want detailed information.
    #   When you created the health check, `CreateHealthCheck` returned the ID
    #   in the response, in the `HealthCheckId` element.
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :health_check_version
    #   A sequential counter that Amazon Route 53 sets to `1` when you create
    #   a health check and increments by 1 each time you update settings for
    #   the health check.
    #
    #   We recommend that you use `GetHealthCheck` or `ListHealthChecks` to
    #   get the current value of `HealthCheckVersion` for the health check
    #   that you want to update, and that you include that value in your
    #   `UpdateHealthCheck` request. This prevents Route 53 from overwriting
    #   an intervening update:
    #
    #   * If the value in the `UpdateHealthCheck` request matches the value of
    #     `HealthCheckVersion` in the health check, Route 53 updates the
    #     health check with the new settings.
    #
    #   * If the value of `HealthCheckVersion` in the health check is greater,
    #     the health check was changed after you got the version number. Route
    #     53 does not update the health check, and it returns a
    #     `HealthCheckVersionMismatch` error.
    #
    # @option params [String] :ip_address
    #   The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address for the endpoint that you want Amazon
    #   Route 53 to perform health checks on. If you don't specify a value
    #   for `IPAddress`, Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the domain
    #   name that you specify in `FullyQualifiedDomainName` at the interval
    #   that you specify in `RequestInterval`. Using an IP address that is
    #   returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.
    #
    #   Use one of the following formats for the value of `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   * **IPv4 address**\: four values between 0 and 255, separated by
    #     periods (.), for example, `192.0.2.44`.
    #
    #   * **IPv6 address**\: eight groups of four hexadecimal values,
    #     separated by colons (:), for example,
    #     `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345`. You can also shorten IPv6
    #     addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example,
    #     `2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345`.
    #
    #   If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an
    #   Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify
    #   the Elastic IP address for `IPAddress`. This ensures that the IP
    #   address of your instance never changes. For more information, see the
    #   applicable documentation:
    #
    #   * Linux: [Elastic IP Addresses (EIP)][1] in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide
    #     for Linux Instances*
    #
    #   * Windows: [Elastic IP Addresses (EIP)][2] in the *Amazon EC2 User
    #     Guide for Windows Instances*
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If a health check already has a value for `IPAddress`, you can change
    #   the value. However, you can't update an existing health check to add
    #   or remove the value of `IPAddress`.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   For more information, see [FullyQualifiedDomainName][3].
    #
    #   Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which
    #   the IP address is in local, private, non-routable, or multicast
    #   ranges. For more information about IP addresses for which you can't
    #   create health checks, see the following documents:

    #   return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy,
    #   for example the file /docs/route53-health-check.html. You can also
    #   include query string parameters, for example,
    #   `/welcome.html?language=jp&login=y`.
    #
    #   Specify this value only if you want to change it.
    #
    # @option params [String] :fully_qualified_domain_name
    #   Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for
    #   `IPAddress`.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If a health check already has a value for `IPAddress`, you can change
    #   the value. However, you can't update an existing health check to add
    #   or remove the value of `IPAddress`.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   **If you specify a value for** `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6
    #   address and passes the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the
    #   `Host` header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is
    #   typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you
    #   want Route 53 to perform health checks.
    #
    #   When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it
    #   constructs the `Host` header:
    #
    #   * If you specify a value of `80` for `Port` and `HTTP` or
    #     `HTTP_STR_MATCH` for `Type`, Route 53 passes the value of
    #     `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
    #
    #   * If you specify a value of `443` for `Port` and `HTTPS` or
    #     `HTTPS_STR_MATCH` for `Type`, Route 53 passes the value of
    #     `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `Host` header.
    #
    #   * If you specify another value for `Port` and any value except `TCP`
    #     for `Type`, Route 53 passes <i>
    #     <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>\:<code>Port</code> </i> to the
    #     endpoint in the `Host` header.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, Route 53
    #   substitutes the value of `IPAddress` in the `Host` header in each of
    #   the above cases.
    #
    #   **If you don't specify a value for** `IPAddress`\:
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`, Route 53 sends a DNS
    #   request to the domain that you specify in `FullyQualifiedDomainName`
    #   at the interval you specify in `RequestInterval`. Using an IPv4
    #   address that is returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of
    #   the endpoint.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> If you don't specify a value for `IPAddress`, Route 53 uses only IPv4
    #   to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record
    #   set with a type of A for the name that you specify for
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, the health check fails with a "DNS
    #   resolution failed" error.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover
    #   resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, we recommend that you create a separate
    #   health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for
    #   each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the
    #   value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, specify the domain name of the
    #   server (such as `us-east-2-www.example.com`), not the name of the
    #   resource record sets (www.example.com).
    #
    #   In this configuration, if the value of `FullyQualifiedDomainName`
    #   matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate
    #   the health check with those resource record sets, health check results
    #   will be unpredictable.
    #
    #   In addition, if the value of `Type` is `HTTP`, `HTTPS`,
    #   `HTTP_STR_MATCH`, or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH`, Route 53 passes the value of
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName` in the `Host` header, as it does when you
    #   specify a value for `IPAddress`. If the value of `Type` is `TCP`,
    #   Route 53 doesn't pass a `Host` header.
    #
    # @option params [String] :search_string
    #   If the value of `Type` is `HTTP_STR_MATCH` or `HTTPS_STR_MATCH`, the
    #   string that you want Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response
    #   body from the specified resource. If the string appears in the
    #   response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy. (You can't
    #   change the value of `Type` when you update a health check.)
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :failure_threshold
    #   The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or
    #   fail for Amazon Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint
    #   from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more information, see
    #   [How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy][1] in
    #   the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value for `FailureThreshold`, the default
    #   value is three health checks.

    #
    # @option params [Boolean] :inverted
    #   Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a
    #   health check, for example, to consider a health check unhealthy when
    #   it otherwise would be considered healthy.
    #
    # @option params [Boolean] :disabled
    #   Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a
    #   health check, here's what happens:
    #
    #   * **Health checks that check the health of endpoints:** Route 53 stops
    #     submitting requests to your application, server, or other resource.
    #
    #   * **Calculated health checks:** Route 53 stops aggregating the status
    #     of the referenced health checks.
    #
    #   * **Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms:** Route 53 stops
    #     monitoring the corresponding CloudWatch metrics.
    #
    #   After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the
    #   health check to always be healthy. If you configured DNS failover,
    #   Route 53 continues to route traffic to the corresponding resources. If
    #   you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the value of
    #   [Inverted][1].
    #
    #   Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is
    #   disabled. For more information, see [Amazon Route 53 Pricing][2].

    #
    # @option params [Integer] :health_threshold
    #   The number of child health checks that are associated with a
    #   `CALCULATED` health that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the
    #   `CALCULATED` health check to be considered healthy. To specify the
    #   child health checks that you want to associate with a `CALCULATED`
    #   health check, use the `ChildHealthChecks` and `ChildHealthCheck`
    #   elements.
    #
    #   Note the following:
    #
    #   * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health
    #     checks, Route 53 always considers this health check to be unhealthy.
    #
    #   * If you specify `0`, Route 53 always considers this health check to
    #     be healthy.
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :child_health_checks
    #   A complex type that contains one `ChildHealthCheck` element for each
    #   health check that you want to associate with a `CALCULATED` health
    #   check.
    #
    # @option params [Boolean] :enable_sni
    #   Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName` to the endpoint in the `client_hello`
    #   message during `TLS` negotiation. This allows the endpoint to respond
    #   to `HTTPS` health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS
    #   certificate.
    #
    #   Some endpoints require that HTTPS requests include the host name in
    #   the `client_hello` message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of
    #   the health check will be SSL alert `handshake_failure`. A health check
    #   can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is enabled and
    #   you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on
    #   your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid.
    #
    #   The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the
    #   `Common Name` field and possibly several more in the `Subject
    #   Alternative Names` field. One of the domain names in the certificate
    #   should match the value that you specify for
    #   `FullyQualifiedDomainName`. If the endpoint responds to the
    #   `client_hello` message with a certificate that does not include the
    #   domain name that you specified in `FullyQualifiedDomainName`, a health
    #   checker will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health
    #   checker will omit `FullyQualifiedDomainName` from the `client_hello`
    #   message.
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :regions
    #   A complex type that contains one `Region` element for each region that
    #   you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the specified
    #   endpoint from.
    #
    # @option params [Types::AlarmIdentifier] :alarm_identifier
    #   A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want
    #   Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to determine whether the
    #   specified health check is healthy.
    #
    # @option params [String] :insufficient_data_health_status
    #   When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine
    #   the alarm state, the status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to
    #   the health check:
    #
    #   * `Healthy`\: Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.
    #
    #   * `Unhealthy`\: Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.
    #
    #   * `LastKnownStatus`\: Route 53 uses the status of the health check
    #     from the last time CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the
    #     alarm state. For new health checks that have no last known status,
    #     the default status for the health check is healthy.
    #
    # @option params [Array<String>] :reset_elements
    #   A complex type that contains one `ResettableElementName` element for
    #   each element that you want to reset to the default value. Valid values
    #   for `ResettableElementName` include the following:
    #
    #   * `ChildHealthChecks`\: Amazon Route 53 resets [ChildHealthChecks][1]
    #     to null.
    #
    #   * `FullyQualifiedDomainName`\: Route 53 resets
    #     [FullyQualifiedDomainName][2]. to null.
    #
    #   * `Regions`\: Route 53 resets the [Regions][3] list to the default set
    #     of regions.
    #
    #   * `ResourcePath`\: Route 53 resets [ResourcePath][4] to null.

    # * It makes the maximum number of attempts
    #
    # In between attempts, the waiter will sleep.
    #
    #     # polls in a loop, sleeping between attempts
    #     client.wait_until(waiter_name, params)
    #
    # ## Configuration
    #
    # You can configure the maximum number of polling attempts, and the
    # delay (in seconds) between each polling attempt. You can pass
    # configuration as the final arguments hash.
    #
    #     # poll for ~25 seconds
    #     client.wait_until(waiter_name, params, {
    #       max_attempts: 5,
    #       delay: 5,
    #     })
    #
    # ## Callbacks
    #
    # You can be notified before each polling attempt and before each
    # delay. If you throw `:success` or `:failure` from these callbacks,
    # it will terminate the waiter.
    #
    #     started_at = Time.now
    #     client.wait_until(waiter_name, params, {
    #
    #       # disable max attempts
    #       max_attempts: nil,
    #
    #       # poll for 1 hour, instead of a number of attempts
    #       before_wait: -> (attempts, response) do
    #         throw :failure if Time.now - started_at > 3600
    #       end
    #     })
    #
    # ## Handling Errors
    #
    # When a waiter is unsuccessful, it will raise an error.
    # All of the failure errors extend from
    # {Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed}.
    #
    #     begin
    #       client.wait_until(...)
    #     rescue Aws::Waiters::Errors::WaiterFailed
    #       # resource did not enter the desired state in time
    #     end
    #
    # ## Valid Waiters
    #
    # The following table lists the valid waiter names, the operations they call,
    # and the default `:delay` and `:max_attempts` values.
    #
    # | waiter_name                  | params              | :delay   | :max_attempts |
    # | ---------------------------- | ------------------- | -------- | ------------- |
    # | resource_record_sets_changed | {Client#get_change} | 30       | 60            |
