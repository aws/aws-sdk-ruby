    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] expr
    #   Defines one or more numeric expressions that can be used to sort

    #
    #   You specify the expressions in JSON using the form

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] facet
    #   Specifies one or more fields for which to get facet information, and
    #   options that control how the facet information is returned. Each
    #   specified field must be facet-enabled in the domain configuration.
    #   The fields and options are specified in JSON using the form
    #   `\{"FIELD":\{"OPTION":VALUE,"OPTION:"STRING"\},"FIELD":\{"OPTION":VALUE,"OPTION":"STRING"\}\}`.
    #
    #   You can specify the following faceting options:
    #
    #   * `buckets` specifies an array of the facet values or ranges to
    #     count. Ranges are specified using the same syntax that you use to
    #     search for a range of values. For more information, see [
    #     Searching for a Range of Values][1] in the *Amazon CloudSearch
    #     Developer Guide*. Buckets are returned in the order they are
    #     specified in the request. The `sort` and `size` options are not
    #     valid if you specify `buckets`.
    #
    #   * `size` specifies the maximum number of facets to include in the
    #     results. By default, Amazon CloudSearch returns counts for the top
    #     10. The `size` parameter is only valid when you specify the `sort`
    #     option; it cannot be used in conjunction with `buckets`.
    #
    #   * `sort` specifies how you want to sort the facets in the results:
    #     `bucket` or `count`. Specify `bucket` to sort alphabetically or
    #     numerically by facet value (in ascending order). Specify `count`
    #     to sort by the facet counts computed for each facet value (in
    #     descending order). To retrieve facet counts for particular values
    #     or ranges of values, use the `buckets` option instead of `sort`.
    #
    #   If no facet options are specified, facet counts are computed for all
    #   field values, the facets are sorted by facet count, and the top 10
    #   facets are returned in the results.
    #
    #   To count particular buckets of values, use the `buckets` option. For
    #   example, the following request uses the `buckets` option to
    #   calculate and return facet counts by decade.
    #
    #   `
    #   \{"year":\{"buckets":["[1970,1979]","[1980,1989]","[1990,1999]","[2000,2009]","[2010,\}"]\}\}
    #   `
    #
    #   To sort facets by facet count, use the `count` option. For example,
    #   the following request sets the `sort` option to `count` to sort the
    #   facet values by facet count, with the facet values that have the
    #   most matching documents listed first. Setting the `size` option to 3
    #   returns only the top three facet values.
    #
    #   ` \{"year":\{"sort":"count","size":3\}\} `
    #
    #   To sort the facets by value, use the `bucket` option. For example,
    #   the following request sets the `sort` option to `bucket` to sort the
    #   facet values numerically by year, with earliest year listed first.
    #
    #   ` \{"year":\{"sort":"bucket"\}\} `
    #
    #   For more information, see [Getting and Using Facet Information][2]
    #   in the *Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide*.

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] filter_query
    #   Specifies a structured query that filters the results of a search
    #   without affecting how the results are scored and sorted. You use
    #   `filterQuery` in conjunction with the `query` parameter to filter
    #   the documents that match the constraints specified in the `query`
    #   parameter. Specifying a filter controls only which matching
    #   documents are included in the results, it has no effect on how they
    #   are scored and sorted. The `filterQuery` parameter supports the full
    #   structured query syntax.
    #
    #   For more information about using filters, see [Filtering Matching
    #   Documents][1] in the *Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide*.

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] highlight
    #   Retrieves highlights for matches in the specified `text` or
    #   `text-array` fields. Each specified field must be highlight enabled
    #   in the domain configuration. The fields and options are specified in
    #   JSON using the form
    #   `\{"FIELD":\{"OPTION":VALUE,"OPTION:"STRING"\},"FIELD":\{"OPTION":VALUE,"OPTION":"STRING"\}\}`.
    #
    #   You can specify the following highlight options:
    #
    #   * `format`\: specifies the format of the data in the text field:
    #     `text` or `html`. When data is returned as HTML, all
    #     non-alphanumeric characters are encoded. The default is `html`.
    #   * `max_phrases`\: specifies the maximum number of occurrences of the
    #     search term(s) you want to highlight. By default, the first
    #     occurrence is highlighted.
    #   * `pre_tag`\: specifies the string to prepend to an occurrence of a
    #     search term. The default for HTML highlights is `&lt;em&gt;`. The
    #     default for text highlights is `*`.
    #   * `post_tag`\: specifies the string to append to an occurrence of a
    #     search term. The default for HTML highlights is `&lt;/em&gt;`. The
    #     default for text highlights is `*`.
    #
    #   If no highlight options are specified for a field, the returned
    #   field text is treated as HTML and the first match is highlighted
    #   with emphasis tags: `&lt;em>search-term&lt;/em&gt;`.
    #
    #   For example, the following request retrieves highlights for the
    #   `actors` and `title` fields.
    #
    #   `\{ "actors": \{\}, "title": \{"format": "text","max_phrases":
    #   2,"pre_tag": "","post_tag": ""\} \}`
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] partial
    #   Enables partial results to be returned if one or more index
    #   partitions are unavailable. When your search index is partitioned
    #   across multiple search instances, by default Amazon CloudSearch only
    #   returns results if every partition can be queried. This means that
    #   the failure of a single search instance can result in 5xx (internal
    #   server) errors. When you enable partial results, Amazon CloudSearch
    #   returns whatever results are available and includes the percentage
    #   of documents searched in the search results (percent-searched). This
    #   enables you to more gracefully degrade your users' search
    #   experience. For example, rather than displaying no results, you
    #   could display the partial results and a message indicating that the
    #   results might be incomplete due to a temporary system outage.
    #   @return [Boolean]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] query
    #   Specifies the search criteria for the request. How you specify the
    #   search criteria depends on the query parser used for the request and
    #   the parser options specified in the `queryOptions` parameter. By
    #   default, the `simple` query parser is used to process requests. To
    #   use the `structured`, `lucene`, or `dismax` query parser, you must
    #   also specify the `queryParser` parameter.
    #
    #   For more information about specifying search criteria, see
    #   [Searching Your Data][1] in the *Amazon CloudSearch Developer
    #   Guide*.
    #
    #
    #
    #   [1]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide/searching.html
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] query_options
    #   Configures options for the query parser specified in the
    #   `queryParser` parameter. You specify the options in JSON using the
    #   following form
    #   `\{"OPTION1":"VALUE1","OPTION2":VALUE2"..."OPTIONN":"VALUEN"\}.`
    #
    #   The options you can configure vary according to which parser you
    #   use:
    #
    #   * `defaultOperator`\: The default operator used to combine
    #     individual terms in the search string. For example:
    #     `defaultOperator: 'or'`. For the `dismax` parser, you specify a
    #     percentage that represents the percentage of terms in the search
    #     string (rounded down) that must match, rather than a default
    #     operator. A value of `0%` is the equivalent to OR, and a value of
    #     `100%` is equivalent to AND. The percentage must be specified as a
    #     value in the range 0-100 followed by the percent (%) symbol. For
    #     example, `defaultOperator: 50%`. Valid values: `and`, `or`, a
    #     percentage in the range 0%-100% (`dismax`). Default: `and`
    #     (`simple`, `structured`, `lucene`) or `100` (`dismax`). Valid for:
    #     `simple`, `structured`, `lucene`, and `dismax`.
    #   * `fields`\: An array of the fields to search when no fields are
    #     specified in a search. If no fields are specified in a search and
    #     this option is not specified, all text and text-array fields are
    #     searched. You can specify a weight for each field to control the
    #     relative importance of each field when Amazon CloudSearch
    #     calculates relevance scores. To specify a field weight, append a
    #     caret (`^`) symbol and the weight to the field name. For example,
    #     to boost the importance of the `title` field over the
    #     `description` field you could specify:
    #     `"fields":["title^5","description"]`. Valid values: The name of
    #     any configured field and an optional numeric value greater than
    #     zero. Default: All `text` and `text-array` fields. Valid for:
    #     `simple`, `structured`, `lucene`, and `dismax`.
    #   * `operators`\: An array of the operators or special characters you
    #     want to disable for the simple query parser. If you disable the
    #     `and`, `or`, or `not` operators, the corresponding operators (`+`,
    #     `|`, `-`) have no special meaning and are dropped from the search
    #     string. Similarly, disabling `prefix` disables the wildcard
    #     operator (`*`) and disabling `phrase` disables the ability to
    #     search for phrases by enclosing phrases in double quotes.
    #     Disabling precedence disables the ability to control order of
    #     precedence using parentheses. Disabling `near` disables the
    #     ability to use the ~ operator to perform a sloppy phrase search.
    #     Disabling the `fuzzy` operator disables the ability to use the ~
    #     operator to perform a fuzzy search. `escape` disables the ability
    #     to use a backslash (``) to escape special characters within the
    #     search string. Disabling whitespace is an advanced option that
    #     prevents the parser from tokenizing on whitespace, which can be
    #     useful for Vietnamese. (It prevents Vietnamese words from being
    #     split incorrectly.) For example, you could disable all operators
    #     other than the phrase operator to support just simple term and
    #     phrase queries: `"operators":["and","not","or", "prefix"]`. Valid
    #     values: `and`, `escape`, `fuzzy`, `near`, `not`, `or`, `phrase`,
    #     `precedence`, `prefix`, `whitespace`. Default: All operators and
    #     special characters are enabled. Valid for: `simple`.
    #   * `phraseFields`\: An array of the `text` or `text-array` fields you
    #     want to use for phrase searches. When the terms in the search
    #     string appear in close proximity within a field, the field scores
    #     higher. You can specify a weight for each field to boost that
    #     score. The `phraseSlop` option controls how much the matches can
    #     deviate from the search string and still be boosted. To specify a
    #     field weight, append a caret (`^`) symbol and the weight to the
    #     field name. For example, to boost phrase matches in the `title`
    #     field over the `abstract` field, you could specify:
    #     `"phraseFields":["title^3", "plot"]` Valid values: The name of any
    #     `text` or `text-array` field and an optional numeric value greater
    #     than zero. Default: No fields. If you don't specify any fields
    #     with `phraseFields`, proximity scoring is disabled even if
    #     `phraseSlop` is specified. Valid for: `dismax`.
    #   * `phraseSlop`\: An integer value that specifies how much matches
    #     can deviate from the search phrase and still be boosted according
    #     to the weights specified in the `phraseFields` option; for
    #     example, `phraseSlop: 2`. You must also specify `phraseFields` to
    #     enable proximity scoring. Valid values: positive integers.
    #     Default: 0. Valid for: `dismax`.
    #   * `explicitPhraseSlop`\: An integer value that specifies how much a
    #     match can deviate from the search phrase when the phrase is
    #     enclosed in double quotes in the search string. (Phrases that
    #     exceed this proximity distance are not considered a match.) For
    #     example, to specify a slop of three for dismax phrase queries, you
    #     would specify `"explicitPhraseSlop":3`. Valid values: positive
    #     integers. Default: 0. Valid for: `dismax`.
    #   * `tieBreaker`\: When a term in the search string is found in a
    #     document's field, a score is calculated for that field based on
    #     how common the word is in that field compared to other documents.
    #     If the term occurs in multiple fields within a document, by
    #     default only the highest scoring field contributes to the
    #     document's overall score. You can specify a `tieBreaker` value to
    #     enable the matches in lower-scoring fields to contribute to the
    #     document's score. That way, if two documents have the same max
    #     field score for a particular term, the score for the document that
    #     has matches in more fields will be higher. The formula for
    #     calculating the score with a tieBreaker is `(max field score) +

    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] query_parser
    #   Specifies which query parser to use to process the request. If
    #   `queryParser` is not specified, Amazon CloudSearch uses the `simple`
    #   query parser.
    #
    #   Amazon CloudSearch supports four query parsers:
    #
    #   * `simple`\: perform simple searches of `text` and `text-array`
    #     fields. By default, the `simple` query parser searches all `text`
    #     and `text-array` fields. You can specify which fields to search by
    #     with the `queryOptions` parameter. If you prefix a search term
    #     with a plus sign (+) documents must contain the term to be
    #     considered a match. (This is the default, unless you configure the
    #     default operator with the `queryOptions` parameter.) You can use
    #     the `-` (NOT), `|` (OR), and `*` (wildcard) operators to exclude
    #     particular terms, find results that match any of the specified
    #     terms, or search for a prefix. To search for a phrase rather than
    #     individual terms, enclose the phrase in double quotes. For more
    #     information, see [Searching for Text][1] in the *Amazon
    #     CloudSearch Developer Guide*.
    #   * `structured`\: perform advanced searches by combining multiple
    #     expressions to define the search criteria. You can also search
    #     within particular fields, search for values and ranges of values,
    #     and use advanced options such as term boosting, `matchall`, and
    #     `near`. For more information, see [Constructing Compound
    #     Queries][2] in the *Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide*.
    #   * `lucene`\: search using the Apache Lucene query parser syntax. For
    #     more information, see [Apache Lucene Query Parser Syntax][3].
    #   * `dismax`\: search using the simplified subset of the Apache Lucene
    #     query parser syntax defined by the DisMax query parser. For more
    #     information, see [DisMax Query Parser Syntax][4].

    # @!attribute [rw] return
    #   Specifies the field and expression values to include in the
    #   response. Multiple fields or expressions are specified as a
    #   comma-separated list. By default, a search response includes all
    #   return enabled fields (`_all_fields`). To return only the document
    #   IDs for the matching documents, specify `_no_fields`. To retrieve
    #   the relevance score calculated for each document, specify `_score`.

    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] sort
    #   Specifies the fields or custom expressions to use to sort the search
    #   results. Multiple fields or expressions are specified as a
    #   comma-separated list. You must specify the sort direction (`asc` or
    #   `desc`) for each field; for example, `year desc,title asc`. To use a
    #   field to sort results, the field must be sort-enabled in the domain
    #   configuration. Array type fields cannot be used for sorting. If no
    #   `sort` parameter is specified, results are sorted by their default
    #   relevance scores in descending order: `_score desc`. You can also
    #   sort by document ID (`_id asc`) and version (`_version desc`).
