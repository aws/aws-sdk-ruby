    #   Services organization, organizational unit (OU), or an account.
    #
    #   Resource policies grant permissions on Amazon Web Services
    #   resources. Resource policies include trust policies for IAM roles
    #   and bucket policies for Amazon S3 buckets. You can provide a generic
    #   input such as identity policy or resource policy or a specific input
    #   such as managed policy or Amazon S3 bucket policy.

    #   policy to attach to an Amazon S3 bucket, you can choose
    #   `AWS::S3::Bucket` for the policy validation resource type.
    #
    #   For resource types not supported as valid values, IAM Access
    #   Analyzer runs policy checks that apply to all resource policies. For
    #   example, to validate a resource policy to attach to a KMS key, do

    #   Access Analyzer will run policy checks that apply to all resource
    #   policies.
