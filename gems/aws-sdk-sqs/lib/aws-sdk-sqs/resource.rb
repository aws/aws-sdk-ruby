    # @param [Hash] options ({})
    # @option options [required, String] :queue_name
    #   The name of the new queue. The following limits apply to this name:
    #
    #   * A queue name can have up to 80 characters.
    #
    #   * Valid values: alphanumeric characters, hyphens (`-`), and
    #     underscores (`_`).
    #
    #   * A FIFO queue name must end with the `.fifo` suffix.
    #
    #   Queue names are case-sensitive.
    # @option options [Hash<String,String>] :attributes
    #   A map of attributes with their corresponding values.
    #
    #   The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special
    #   request parameters that the `CreateQueue` action uses:
    #
    #   * `DelaySeconds` - The length of time, in seconds, for which the
    #     delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An
    #     integer from 0 to 900 seconds (15 minutes). The default is 0 (zero).
    #
    #   * `MaximumMessageSize` - The limit of how many bytes a message can
    #     contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from
    #     1,024 bytes (1 KiB) to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB). The default is
    #     262,144 (256 KiB).
    #
    #   * `MessageRetentionPeriod` - The length of time, in seconds, for which
    #     Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer from 60
    #     seconds (1 minute) to 1,209,600 seconds (14 days). The default is
    #     345,600 (4 days).
    #
    #   * `Policy` - The queue's policy. A valid AWS policy. For more
    #     information about policy structure, see [Overview of AWS IAM
    #     Policies][1] in the *Amazon IAM User Guide*.
    #
    #   * `ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds` - The length of time, in seconds,
    #     for which a ` ReceiveMessage ` action waits for a message to arrive.
    #     Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). The default is 0
    #     (zero).
    #
    #   * `RedrivePolicy` - The string that includes the parameters for the
    #     dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue. For more
    #     information about the redrive policy and dead-letter queues, see
    #     [Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues][2] in the *Amazon Simple Queue
    #     Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #     * `deadLetterTargetArn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
    #       dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the
    #       value of `maxReceiveCount` is exceeded.
    #
    #     * `maxReceiveCount` - The number of times a message is delivered to
    #       the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue.
    #     Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be a
    #     standard queue.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   * `VisibilityTimeout` - The visibility timeout for the queue. Valid
    #     values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). The default is 30.
    #     For more information about the visibility timeout, see [Visibility
    #     Timeout][3] in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   The following attributes apply only to [server-side-encryption][4]\:
    #
    #   * `KmsMasterKeyId` - The ID of an AWS-managed customer master key
    #     (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see [Key
    #     Terms][5]. While the alias of the AWS-managed CMK for Amazon SQS is
    #     always `alias/aws/sqs`, the alias of a custom CMK can, for example,
    #     be `alias/MyAlias `. For more examples, see [KeyId][6] in the *AWS
    #     Key Management Service API Reference*.
    #
    #   * `KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds` - The length of time, in seconds, for
    #     which Amazon SQS can reuse a [data key][7] to encrypt or decrypt
    #     messages before calling AWS KMS again. An integer representing
    #     seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24
    #     hours). The default is 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period
    #     provides better security but results in more calls to KMS which
    #     might incur charges after Free Tier. For more information, see [How
    #     Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work?][8].
    #
    #   The following attributes apply only to [FIFO (first-in-first-out)
    #   queues][9]\:
    #
    #   * `FifoQueue` - Designates a queue as FIFO. Valid values: `true`,
    #     `false`. You can provide this attribute only during queue creation.
    #     You can't change it for an existing queue. When you set this
    #     attribute, you must also provide the `MessageGroupId` for your
    #     messages explicitly.
    #
    #     For more information, see [FIFO Queue Logic][10] in the *Amazon
    #     Simple Queue Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   * `ContentBasedDeduplication` - Enables content-based deduplication.
    #     Valid values: `true`, `false`. For more information, see
    #     [Exactly-Once Processing][11] in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service
    #     Developer Guide*.
    #
    #     * Every message must have a unique `MessageDeduplicationId`,
    #
    #       * You may provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` explicitly.
    #
    #       * If you aren't able to provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and
    #         you enable `ContentBasedDeduplication` for your queue, Amazon
    #         SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId`
    #         using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the
    #         message).
    #
    #       * If you don't provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and the queue
    #         doesn't have `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, the action fails
    #         with an error.
    #
    #       * If the queue has `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, your
    #         `MessageDeduplicationId` overrides the generated one.
    #
    #     * When `ContentBasedDeduplication` is in effect, messages with
    #       identical content sent within the deduplication interval are
    #       treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is
    #       delivered.
    #
    #     * If you send one message with `ContentBasedDeduplication` enabled
    #       and then another message with a `MessageDeduplicationId` that is
    #       the same as the one generated for the first
    #       `MessageDeduplicationId`, the two messages are treated as
    #       duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.
    #
    #   Any other valid special request parameters (such as the following) are
    #   ignored:
    #
    #   * `ApproximateNumberOfMessages`
    #
    #   * `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed`
    #
    #   * `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible`
    #
    #   * `CreatedTimestamp`
    #
    #   * `LastModifiedTimestamp`
    #
    #   * `QueueArn`
