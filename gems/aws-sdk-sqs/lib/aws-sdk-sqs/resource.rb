module Aws::SQS

  # This class provides a resource oriented interface for SQS.
  # To create a resource object:
  #
  #     resource = Aws::SQS::Resource.new(region: 'us-west-2')
  #
  # You can supply a client object with custom configuration that will be used for all resource operations.
  # If you do not pass `:client`, a default client will be constructed.
  #
  #     client = Aws::SQS::Client.new(region: 'us-west-2')
  #     resource = Aws::SQS::Resource.new(client: client)
  #
  class Resource

    # @param options ({})
    # @option options [Client] :client
    def initialize(options = {})
      @client = options[:client] || Client.new(options)
    end

    # @return [Client]
    def client
      @client
    end

    #
    #   queue = sqs.create_queue({
    #     queue_name: "String", # required
    #     attributes: {
    #       "All" => "String",
    #     },
    #     tags: {
    #       "TagKey" => "TagValue",
    #     },
    #   })
    # @param [Hash] options ({})
    # @option options [required, String] :queue_name
    #   The name of the new queue. The following limits apply to this name:
    #
    #   * A queue name can have up to 80 characters.
    #
    #   * Valid values: alphanumeric characters, hyphens (`-`), and
    #     underscores (`_`).
    #
    #   * A FIFO queue name must end with the `.fifo` suffix.
    #
    #   Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.
    # @option options [Hash<String,String>] :attributes
    #   A map of attributes with their corresponding values.
    #
    #   The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special
    #   request parameters that the `CreateQueue` action uses:
    #
    #   * `DelaySeconds` – The length of time, in seconds, for which the
    #     delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An
    #     integer from 0 to 900 seconds (15 minutes). Default: 0.
    #
    #   * `MaximumMessageSize` – The limit of how many bytes a message can
    #     contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from
    #     1,024 bytes (1 KiB) to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB). Default: 262,144
    #     (256 KiB).
    #
    #   * `MessageRetentionPeriod` – The length of time, in seconds, for which
    #     Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer from 60
    #     seconds (1 minute) to 1,209,600 seconds (14 days). Default: 345,600
    #     (4 days). When you change a queue's attributes, the change can take
    #     up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout
    #     the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the `MessageRetentionPeriod`
    #     attribute can take up to 15 minutes and will impact existing
    #     messages in the queue potentially causing them to be expired and
    #     deleted if the `MessageRetentionPeriod` is reduced below the age of
    #     existing messages.
    #
    #   * `Policy` – The queue's policy. A valid Amazon Web Services policy.
    #     For more information about policy structure, see [Overview of Amazon
    #     Web Services IAM Policies][1] in the *IAM User Guide*.
    #
    #   * `ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds` – The length of time, in seconds,
    #     for which a ` ReceiveMessage ` action waits for a message to arrive.
    #     Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0.
    #
    #   * `VisibilityTimeout` – The visibility timeout for the queue, in
    #     seconds. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours).
    #     Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout, see
    #     [Visibility Timeout][2] in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   The following attributes apply only to [dead-letter queues:][3]
    #
    #   * `RedrivePolicy` – The string that includes the parameters for the
    #     dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON
    #     object. The parameters are as follows:
    #
    #     * `deadLetterTargetArn` – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
    #       dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the
    #       value of `maxReceiveCount` is exceeded.
    #
    #     * `maxReceiveCount` – The number of times a message is delivered to
    #       the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue.
    #       Default: 10. When the `ReceiveCount` for a message exceeds the
    #       `maxReceiveCount` for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the
    #       dead-letter-queue.
    #
    #   * `RedriveAllowPolicy` – The string that includes the parameters for
    #     the permissions for the dead-letter queue redrive permission and
    #     which source queues can specify dead-letter queues as a JSON object.
    #     The parameters are as follows:
    #
    #     * `redrivePermission` – The permission type that defines which
    #       source queues can specify the current queue as the dead-letter
    #       queue. Valid values are:
    #
    #       * `allowAll` – (Default) Any source queues in this Amazon Web
    #         Services account in the same Region can specify this queue as
    #         the dead-letter queue.
    #
    #       * `denyAll` – No source queues can specify this queue as the
    #         dead-letter queue.
    #
    #       * `byQueue` – Only queues specified by the `sourceQueueArns`
    #         parameter can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.
    #
    #     * `sourceQueueArns` – The Amazon Resource Names (ARN)s of the source
    #       queues that can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue and
    #       redrive messages. You can specify this parameter only when the
    #       `redrivePermission` parameter is set to `byQueue`. You can specify
    #       up to 10 source queue ARNs. To allow more than 10 source queues to
    #       specify dead-letter queues, set the `redrivePermission` parameter
    #       to `allowAll`.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue.
    #   Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be a
    #   standard queue.
    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   The following attributes apply only to [server-side-encryption][4]:
    #
    #   * `KmsMasterKeyId` – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer
    #     master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more
    #     information, see [Key Terms][5]. While the alias of the Amazon Web
    #     Services managed CMK for Amazon SQS is always `alias/aws/sqs`, the
    #     alias of a custom CMK can, for example, be `alias/MyAlias `. For
    #     more examples, see [KeyId][6] in the *Key Management Service API
    #     Reference*.
    #
    #   * `KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds` – The length of time, in seconds, for
    #     which Amazon SQS can reuse a [data key][7] to encrypt or decrypt
    #     messages before calling KMS again. An integer representing seconds,
    #     between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours).
    #     Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better
    #     security but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges
    #     after Free Tier. For more information, see [How Does the Data Key
    #     Reuse Period Work?][8]
    #
    #   * `SqsManagedSseEnabled` – Enables server-side queue encryption using
    #     SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption option is
    #     supported per queue (for example, [SSE-KMS][9] or [SSE-SQS][10]).
    #
    #   The following attributes apply only to [FIFO (first-in-first-out)
    #   queues][11]:
    #
    #   * `FifoQueue` – Designates a queue as FIFO. Valid values are `true`
    #     and `false`. If you don't specify the `FifoQueue` attribute, Amazon
    #     SQS creates a standard queue. You can provide this attribute only
    #     during queue creation. You can't change it for an existing queue.
    #     When you set this attribute, you must also provide the
    #     `MessageGroupId` for your messages explicitly.
    #
    #     For more information, see [FIFO queue logic][12] in the *Amazon SQS
    #     Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   * `ContentBasedDeduplication` – Enables content-based deduplication.
    #     Valid values are `true` and `false`. For more information, see
    #     [Exactly-once processing][13] in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.
    #     Note the following:
    #
    #     * Every message must have a unique `MessageDeduplicationId`.
    #
    #       * You may provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` explicitly.
    #
    #       * If you aren't able to provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and
    #         you enable `ContentBasedDeduplication` for your queue, Amazon
    #         SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId`
    #         using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the
    #         message).
    #
    #       * If you don't provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and the queue
    #         doesn't have `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, the action fails
    #         with an error.
    #
    #       * If the queue has `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, your
    #         `MessageDeduplicationId` overrides the generated one.
    #
    #     * When `ContentBasedDeduplication` is in effect, messages with
    #       identical content sent within the deduplication interval are
    #       treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is
    #       delivered.
    #
    #     * If you send one message with `ContentBasedDeduplication` enabled
    #       and then another message with a `MessageDeduplicationId` that is
    #       the same as the one generated for the first
    #       `MessageDeduplicationId`, the two messages are treated as
    #       duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.
    #
    #   The following attributes apply only to [high throughput for FIFO
    #   queues][14]:
    #
    #   * `DeduplicationScope` – Specifies whether message deduplication
    #     occurs at the message group or queue level. Valid values are
    #     `messageGroup` and `queue`.
    #
    #   * `FifoThroughputLimit` – Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput
    #     quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values
    #     are `perQueue` and `perMessageGroupId`. The `perMessageGroupId`
    #     value is allowed only when the value for `DeduplicationScope` is
    #     `messageGroup`.
    #
    #   To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:
    #
    #   * Set `DeduplicationScope` to `messageGroup`.
    #
    #   * Set `FifoThroughputLimit` to `perMessageGroupId`.
    #
    #   If you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown
    #   for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and
    #   deduplication occurs as specified.
    #
    #   For information on throughput quotas, see [Quotas related to
    #   messages][15] in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.

    # @option options [Hash<String,String>] :tags
    #   Add cost allocation tags to the specified Amazon SQS queue. For an
    #   overview, see [Tagging Your Amazon SQS Queues][1] in the *Amazon SQS
    #   Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   When you use queue tags, keep the following guidelines in mind:
    #
    #   * Adding more than 50 tags to a queue isn't recommended.
    #
    #   * Tags don't have any semantic meaning. Amazon SQS interprets tags as
    #     character strings.
    #
    #   * Tags are case-sensitive.
    #
    #   * A new tag with a key identical to that of an existing tag overwrites
    #     the existing tag.
    #
    #   For a full list of tag restrictions, see [Quotas related to queues][2]
    #   in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> To be able to tag a queue on creation, you must have the
    #   `sqs:CreateQueue` and `sqs:TagQueue` permissions.
    #
    #    Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more
    #   information, see [Grant cross-account permissions to a role and a
    #   username][3] in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.
