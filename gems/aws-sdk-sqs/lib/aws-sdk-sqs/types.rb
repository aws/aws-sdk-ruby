    #   Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] attributes
    #   A map of attributes with their corresponding values.
    #
    #   The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the
    #   special request parameters that the `CreateQueue` action uses:
    #
    #   * `DelaySeconds` - The length of time, in seconds, for which the
    #     delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An
    #     integer from 0 to 900 seconds (15 minutes). Default: 0.
    #
    #   * `MaximumMessageSize` - The limit of how many bytes a message can
    #     contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer
    #     from 1,024 bytes (1 KiB) to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB). Default:
    #     262,144 (256 KiB).
    #
    #   * `MessageRetentionPeriod` - The length of time, in seconds, for
    #     which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer from
    #     60 seconds (1 minute) to 1,209,600 seconds (14 days). Default:
    #     345,600 (4 days).
    #
    #   * `Policy` - The queue's policy. A valid AWS policy. For more
    #     information about policy structure, see [Overview of AWS IAM
    #     Policies][1] in the *Amazon IAM User Guide*.
    #
    #   * `ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds` - The length of time, in seconds,
    #     for which a ` ReceiveMessage ` action waits for a message to
    #     arrive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default:
    #     0.
    #
    #   * `RedrivePolicy` - The string that includes the parameters for the
    #     dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue. For more
    #     information about the redrive policy and dead-letter queues, see
    #     [Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues][2] in the *Amazon Simple
    #     Queue Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #     * `deadLetterTargetArn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
    #       dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the
    #       value of `maxReceiveCount` is exceeded.
    #
    #     * `maxReceiveCount` - The number of times a message is delivered
    #       to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue.
    #       When the `ReceiveCount` for a message exceeds the
    #       `maxReceiveCount` for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to
    #       the dead-letter-queue.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue.
    #     Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be
    #     a standard queue.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   * `VisibilityTimeout` - The visibility timeout for the queue, in
    #     seconds. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours).
    #     Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout,
    #     see [Visibility Timeout][3] in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service
    #     Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   The following attributes apply only to [server-side-encryption][4]\:
    #
    #   * `KmsMasterKeyId` - The ID of an AWS-managed customer master key
    #     (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see
    #     [Key Terms][5]. While the alias of the AWS-managed CMK for Amazon
    #     SQS is always `alias/aws/sqs`, the alias of a custom CMK can, for
    #     example, be `alias/MyAlias `. For more examples, see [KeyId][6] in
    #     the *AWS Key Management Service API Reference*.
    #
    #   * `KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds` - The length of time, in seconds,
    #     for which Amazon SQS can reuse a [data key][7] to encrypt or
    #     decrypt messages before calling AWS KMS again. An integer
    #     representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400
    #     seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time
    #     period provides better security but results in more calls to KMS
    #     which might incur charges after Free Tier. For more information,
    #     see [How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work?][8].
    #
    #   The following attributes apply only to [FIFO (first-in-first-out)
    #   queues][9]\:
    #
    #   * `FifoQueue` - Designates a queue as FIFO. Valid values: `true`,
    #     `false`. If you don't specify the `FifoQueue` attribute, Amazon
    #     SQS creates a standard queue. You can provide this attribute only
    #     during queue creation. You can't change it for an existing queue.
    #     When you set this attribute, you must also provide the
    #     `MessageGroupId` for your messages explicitly.
    #
    #     For more information, see [FIFO Queue Logic][10] in the *Amazon
    #     Simple Queue Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   * `ContentBasedDeduplication` - Enables content-based deduplication.
    #     Valid values: `true`, `false`. For more information, see
    #     [Exactly-Once Processing][11] in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service
    #     Developer Guide*.
    #
    #     * Every message must have a unique `MessageDeduplicationId`,
    #
    #       * You may provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` explicitly.
    #
    #       * If you aren't able to provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and
    #         you enable `ContentBasedDeduplication` for your queue, Amazon
    #         SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the
    #         `MessageDeduplicationId` using the body of the message (but
    #         not the attributes of the message).
    #
    #       * If you don't provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and the queue
    #         doesn't have `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, the action
    #         fails with an error.
    #
    #       * If the queue has `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, your
    #         `MessageDeduplicationId` overrides the generated one.
    #
    #     * When `ContentBasedDeduplication` is in effect, messages with
    #       identical content sent within the deduplication interval are
    #       treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is
    #       delivered.
    #
    #     * If you send one message with `ContentBasedDeduplication` enabled
    #       and then another message with a `MessageDeduplicationId` that is
    #       the same as the one generated for the first
    #       `MessageDeduplicationId`, the two messages are treated as
    #       duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.

    # @!attribute [rw] tags
    #   Add cost allocation tags to the specified Amazon SQS queue. For an
    #   overview, see [Tagging Your Amazon SQS Queues][1] in the *Amazon
    #   Simple Queue Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   When you use queue tags, keep the following guidelines in mind:
    #
    #   * Adding more than 50 tags to a queue isn't recommended.
    #
    #   * Tags don't have any semantic meaning. Amazon SQS interprets tags
    #     as character strings.
    #
    #   * Tags are case-sensitive.
    #
    #   * A new tag with a key identical to that of an existing tag
    #     overwrites the existing tag.
    #
    #   For a full list of tag restrictions, see [Limits Related to
    #   Queues][2] in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   <note markdown="1"> To be able to tag a queue on creation, you must have the
    #   `sqs:CreateQueue` and `sqs:TagQueue` permissions.
    #
    #    Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more
    #   information, see [Grant Cross-Account Permissions to a Role and a

    #
    #    </note>
    #
    #   The following attributes are supported:
    #
    #   * `All` - Returns all values.
    #
    #   * `ApproximateNumberOfMessages` - Returns the approximate number of
    #     messages available for retrieval from the queue.
    #
    #   * `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed` - Returns the approximate
    #     number of messages in the queue that are delayed and not available
    #     for reading immediately. This can happen when the queue is
    #     configured as a delay queue or when a message has been sent with a
    #     delay parameter.
    #
    #   * `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible` - Returns the approximate
    #     number of messages that are in flight. Messages are considered to
    #     be *in flight* if they have been sent to a client but have not yet
    #     been deleted or have not yet reached the end of their visibility
    #     window.
    #
    #   * `CreatedTimestamp` - Returns the time when the queue was created
    #     in seconds ([epoch time][1]).
    #
    #   * `DelaySeconds` - Returns the default delay on the queue in
    #     seconds.
    #
    #   * `LastModifiedTimestamp` - Returns the time when the queue was last
    #     changed in seconds ([epoch time][1]).
    #
    #   * `MaximumMessageSize` - Returns the limit of how many bytes a
    #     message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it.
    #
    #   * `MessageRetentionPeriod` - Returns the length of time, in seconds,
    #     for which Amazon SQS retains a message.
    #
    #   * `Policy` - Returns the policy of the queue.
    #
    #   * `QueueArn` - Returns the Amazon resource name (ARN) of the queue.
    #
    #   * `ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds` - Returns the length of time, in
    #     seconds, for which the `ReceiveMessage` action waits for a message
    #     to arrive.
    #
    #   * `RedrivePolicy` - Returns the string that includes the parameters
    #     for dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue. For more
    #     information about the redrive policy and dead-letter queues, see
    #     [Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues][2] in the *Amazon Simple
    #     Queue Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #     * `deadLetterTargetArn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
    #       dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the
    #       value of `maxReceiveCount` is exceeded.
    #
    #     * `maxReceiveCount` - The number of times a message is delivered
    #       to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue.
    #       When the `ReceiveCount` for a message exceeds the
    #       `maxReceiveCount` for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to
    #       the dead-letter-queue.
    #
    #   * `VisibilityTimeout` - Returns the visibility timeout for the
    #     queue. For more information about the visibility timeout, see
    #     [Visibility Timeout][3] in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service
    #     Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   The following attributes apply only to [server-side-encryption][4]\:
    #
    #   * `KmsMasterKeyId` - Returns the ID of an AWS-managed customer
    #     master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more
    #     information, see [Key Terms][5].
    #
    #   * `KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds` - Returns the length of time, in
    #     seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or
    #     decrypt messages before calling AWS KMS again. For more
    #     information, see [How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work?][6].
    #
    #   The following attributes apply only to [FIFO (first-in-first-out)
    #   queues][7]\:
    #
    #   * `FifoQueue` - Returns whether the queue is FIFO. For more
    #     information, see [FIFO Queue Logic][8] in the *Amazon Simple Queue
    #     Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> To determine whether a queue is [FIFO][7], you can check whether
    #     `QueueName` ends with the `.fifo` suffix.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   * `ContentBasedDeduplication` - Returns whether content-based
    #     deduplication is enabled for the queue. For more information, see
    #     [Exactly-Once Processing][9] in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service
    #     Developer Guide*.

    #     `MessageGroupId` are returned in sequence.
    #
    #   * `SequenceNumber` - Returns the value provided by Amazon SQS.

    #   [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time
    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] message_attribute_names
    #   The name of the message attribute, where *N* is the index.
    #
    #   * The name can contain alphanumeric characters and the underscore
    #     (`_`), hyphen (`-`), and period (`.`).
    #
    #   * The name is case-sensitive and must be unique among all attribute
    #     names for the message.
    #
    #   * The name must not start with AWS-reserved prefixes such as `AWS.`
    #     or `Amazon.` (or any casing variants).
    #
    #   * The name must not start or end with a period (`.`), and it should
    #     not have periods in succession (`..`).
    #
    #   * The name can be up to 256 characters long.
    #
    #   When using `ReceiveMessage`, you can send a list of attribute names
    #   to receive, or you can return all of the attributes by specifying
    #   `All` or `.*` in your request. You can also use all message
    #   attributes starting with a prefix, for example `bar.*`.
    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] max_number_of_messages
    #   The maximum number of messages to return. Amazon SQS never returns
    #   more messages than this value (however, fewer messages might be
    #   returned). Valid values: 1 to 10. Default: 1.
    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] visibility_timeout
    #   The duration (in seconds) that the received messages are hidden from
    #   subsequent retrieve requests after being retrieved by a
    #   `ReceiveMessage` request.
    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] wait_time_seconds
    #   The duration (in seconds) for which the call waits for a message to
    #   arrive in the queue before returning. If a message is available, the
    #   call returns sooner than `WaitTimeSeconds`. If no messages are
    #   available and the wait time expires, the call returns successfully
    #   with an empty list of messages.
    #   @return [Integer]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] receive_request_attempt_id
    #   This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.
    #
    #   The token used for deduplication of `ReceiveMessage` calls. If a
    #   networking issue occurs after a `ReceiveMessage` action, and instead
    #   of a response you receive a generic error, you can retry the same
    #   action with an identical `ReceiveRequestAttemptId` to retrieve the
    #   same set of messages, even if their visibility timeout has not yet
    #   expired.
    #
    #   * You can use `ReceiveRequestAttemptId` only for 5 minutes after a
    #     `ReceiveMessage` action.
    #
    #   * When you set `FifoQueue`, a caller of the `ReceiveMessage` action
    #     can provide a `ReceiveRequestAttemptId` explicitly.
    #
    #   * If a caller of the `ReceiveMessage` action doesn't provide a
    #     `ReceiveRequestAttemptId`, Amazon SQS generates a
    #     `ReceiveRequestAttemptId`.
    #
    #   * You can retry the `ReceiveMessage` action with the same
    #     `ReceiveRequestAttemptId` if none of the messages have been
    #     modified (deleted or had their visibility changes).
    #
    #   * During a visibility timeout, subsequent calls with the same
    #     `ReceiveRequestAttemptId` return the same messages and receipt
    #     handles. If a retry occurs within the deduplication interval, it
    #     resets the visibility timeout. For more information, see
    #     [Visibility Timeout][1] in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service
    #     Developer Guide*.
    #
    #     If a caller of the `ReceiveMessage` action still processes
    #     messages when the visibility timeout expires and messages become
    #     visible, another worker consuming from the same queue can receive
    #     the same messages and therefore process duplicates. Also, if a
    #     consumer whose message processing time is longer than the
    #     visibility timeout tries to delete the processed messages, the
    #     action fails with an error.
    #
    #      To mitigate this effect, ensure that your application observes a
    #     safe threshold before the visibility timeout expires and extend
    #     the visibility timeout as necessary.
    #
    #   * While messages with a particular `MessageGroupId` are invisible,
    #     no more messages belonging to the same `MessageGroupId` are
    #     returned until the visibility timeout expires. You can still
    #     receive messages with another `MessageGroupId` as long as it is
    #     also visible.
    #
    #   * If a caller of `ReceiveMessage` can't track the
    #     `ReceiveRequestAttemptId`, no retries work until the original
    #     visibility timeout expires. As a result, delays might occur but
    #     the messages in the queue remain in a strict order.
    #
    #   The length of `ReceiveRequestAttemptId` is 128 characters.
    #   `ReceiveRequestAttemptId` can contain alphanumeric characters
    #   (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`) and punctuation (``
    #   !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`\{|\}~ ``).
    #
    #   For best practices of using `ReceiveRequestAttemptId`, see [Using
    #   the ReceiveRequestAttemptId Request Parameter][2] in the *Amazon
    #   Simple Queue Service Developer Guide*.

    #   A map of attributes to set.
    #
    #   The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the
    #   special request parameters that the `SetQueueAttributes` action
    #   uses:
    #
    #   * `DelaySeconds` - The length of time, in seconds, for which the
    #     delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An
    #     integer from 0 to 900 (15 minutes). Default: 0.
    #
    #   * `MaximumMessageSize` - The limit of how many bytes a message can
    #     contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer
    #     from 1,024 bytes (1 KiB) up to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB). Default:
    #     262,144 (256 KiB).
    #
    #   * `MessageRetentionPeriod` - The length of time, in seconds, for
    #     which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer
    #     representing seconds, from 60 (1 minute) to 1,209,600 (14 days).
    #     Default: 345,600 (4 days).
    #
    #   * `Policy` - The queue's policy. A valid AWS policy. For more
    #     information about policy structure, see [Overview of AWS IAM
    #     Policies][1] in the *Amazon IAM User Guide*.
    #
    #   * `ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds` - The length of time, in seconds,
    #     for which a ` ReceiveMessage ` action waits for a message to
    #     arrive. Valid values: an integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default:
    #     0.
    #
    #   * `RedrivePolicy` - The string that includes the parameters for the
    #     dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue. For more
    #     information about the redrive policy and dead-letter queues, see
    #     [Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues][2] in the *Amazon Simple
    #     Queue Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #     * `deadLetterTargetArn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
    #       dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the
    #       value of `maxReceiveCount` is exceeded.
    #
    #     * `maxReceiveCount` - The number of times a message is delivered
    #       to the source queue before being moved to the dead-letter queue.
    #       When the `ReceiveCount` for a message exceeds the
    #       `maxReceiveCount` for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to
    #       the dead-letter-queue.
    #
    #     <note markdown="1"> The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue.
    #     Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be
    #     a standard queue.
    #
    #      </note>
    #
    #   * `VisibilityTimeout` - The visibility timeout for the queue, in
    #     seconds. Valid values: an integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours).
    #     Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout,
    #     see [Visibility Timeout][3] in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service
    #     Developer Guide*.
    #
    #   The following attributes apply only to [server-side-encryption][4]\:
    #
    #   * `KmsMasterKeyId` - The ID of an AWS-managed customer master key
    #     (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see
    #     [Key Terms][5]. While the alias of the AWS-managed CMK for Amazon
    #     SQS is always `alias/aws/sqs`, the alias of a custom CMK can, for
    #     example, be `alias/MyAlias `. For more examples, see [KeyId][6] in
    #     the *AWS Key Management Service API Reference*.
    #
    #   * `KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds` - The length of time, in seconds,
    #     for which Amazon SQS can reuse a [data key][7] to encrypt or
    #     decrypt messages before calling AWS KMS again. An integer
    #     representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400
    #     seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time
    #     period provides better security but results in more calls to KMS
    #     which might incur charges after Free Tier. For more information,
    #     see [How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work?][8].
    #
    #   The following attribute applies only to [FIFO (first-in-first-out)
    #   queues][9]\:
    #
    #   * `ContentBasedDeduplication` - Enables content-based deduplication.
    #     For more information, see [Exactly-Once Processing][10] in the
    #     *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide*.
    #
    #     * Every message must have a unique `MessageDeduplicationId`,
    #
    #       * You may provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` explicitly.
    #
    #       * If you aren't able to provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and
    #         you enable `ContentBasedDeduplication` for your queue, Amazon
    #         SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the
    #         `MessageDeduplicationId` using the body of the message (but
    #         not the attributes of the message).
    #
    #       * If you don't provide a `MessageDeduplicationId` and the queue
    #         doesn't have `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, the action
    #         fails with an error.
    #
    #       * If the queue has `ContentBasedDeduplication` set, your
    #         `MessageDeduplicationId` overrides the generated one.
    #
    #     * When `ContentBasedDeduplication` is in effect, messages with
    #       identical content sent within the deduplication interval are
    #       treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is
    #       delivered.
    #
    #     * If you send one message with `ContentBasedDeduplication` enabled
    #       and then another message with a `MessageDeduplicationId` that is
    #       the same as the one generated for the first
    #       `MessageDeduplicationId`, the two messages are treated as
    #       duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.
