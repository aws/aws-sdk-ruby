    #     Exploration in Amazon Athena. Contact your Amazon Web Services
    #     administrator for help. For more information, see [Setting Up
    #     Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service][1] in the
    #     Application Discovery Service User Guide.
    #
    #   * DELIVERY\_STREAM\_LIMIT\_FAILURE - You reached the limit for
    #     Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams. Reduce the number
    #     of streams or request a limit increase and try again. For more
    #     information, see [Kinesis Data Streams Limits][2] in the Amazon
    #     Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide.
    #
    #   * FIREHOSE\_ROLE\_MISSING - The Data Exploration feature is in an
    #     error state because your user is missing the Amazon Web
    #     ServicesApplicationDiscoveryServiceFirehose role. Turn on Data
    #     Exploration in Amazon Athena and try again. For more information,
    #     see [Creating the Amazon Web
    #     ServicesApplicationDiscoveryServiceFirehose Role][3] in the
    #     Application Discovery Service User Guide.
    #
    #   * FIREHOSE\_STREAM\_DOES\_NOT\_EXIST - The Data Exploration feature
    #     is in an error state because your user is missing one or more of
    #     the Kinesis data delivery streams.
    #
    #   * INTERNAL\_FAILURE - The Data Exploration feature is in an error
    #     state because of an internal failure. Try again later. If this
    #     problem persists, contact Amazon Web Services Support.
    #
    #   * LAKE\_FORMATION\_ACCESS\_DENIED - You don't have sufficient lake
    #     formation permissions to start continuous export. For more
    #     information, see [ Upgrading Amazon Web Services Glue Data
    #     Permissions to the Amazon Web Services Lake Formation Model ][4]
    #     in the Amazon Web Services *Lake Formation Developer Guide*.
    #
    #     You can use one of the following two ways to resolve this issue.
    #
    #     1.  If you donâ€™t want to use the Lake Formation permission model,
    #         you can change the default Data Catalog settings to use only
    #         Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    #         access control for new databases. For more information, see
    #         [Change Data Catalog Settings][5] in the *Lake Formation
    #         Developer Guide*.
    #
    #     2.  You can give the service-linked IAM roles
    #         AWSServiceRoleForApplicationDiscoveryServiceContinuousExport
    #         and AWSApplicationDiscoveryServiceFirehose the required Lake
    #         Formation permissions. For more information, see [ Granting
    #         Database Permissions][6] in the *Lake Formation Developer
    #         Guide*.
    #
    #         1.  AWSServiceRoleForApplicationDiscoveryServiceContinuousExport
    #             - Grant database creator permissions, which gives the role
    #             database creation ability and implicit permissions for any
    #             created tables. For more information, see [ Implicit Lake
    #             Formation Permissions ][7] in the *Lake Formation
    #             Developer Guide*.
    #
    #         2.  AWSApplicationDiscoveryServiceFirehose - Grant describe
    #             permissions for all tables in the database.
    #
    #   * S3\_BUCKET\_LIMIT\_FAILURE - You reached the limit for Amazon S3
    #     buckets. Reduce the number of S3 buckets or request a limit
    #     increase and try again. For more information, see [Bucket
    #     Restrictions and Limitations][8] in the Amazon Simple Storage
    #     Service Developer Guide.
    #
    #   * S3\_NOT\_SIGNED\_UP - Your account is not signed up for the Amazon
    #     S3 service. You must sign up before you can use Amazon S3. You can
    #     sign up at the following URL: [https://aws.amazon.com/s3][9].
