    # An augmented manifest file that provides training data for your custom
    # model. An augmented manifest file is a labeled dataset that is
    # produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth.

    # @!attribute [rw] s3_uri
    #   The Amazon S3 location of the augmented manifest file.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] split
    #   The purpose of the data you've provided in the augmented manifest.
    #   You can either train or test this data. If you don't specify, the
    #   default is train.
    #
    #   TRAIN - all of the documents in the manifest will be used for
    #   training. If no test documents are provided, Amazon Comprehend will
    #   automatically reserve a portion of the training documents for
    #   testing.
    #
    #   TEST - all of the documents in the manifest will be used for
    #   testing.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] attribute_names
    #   The JSON attribute that contains the annotations for your training
    #   documents. The number of attribute names that you specify depends on
    #   whether your augmented manifest file is the output of a single
    #   labeling job or a chained labeling job.
    #
    #   If your file is the output of a single labeling job, specify the
    #   LabelAttributeName key that was used when the job was created in
    #   Ground Truth.
    #
    #   If your file is the output of a chained labeling job, specify the
    #   LabelAttributeName key for one or more jobs in the chain. Each
    #   LabelAttributeName key provides the annotations from an individual
    #   job.
    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] annotation_data_s3_uri
    #   The S3 prefix to the annotation files that are referred in the
    #   augmented manifest file.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] source_documents_s3_uri
    #   The S3 prefix to the source files (PDFs) that are referred to in the
    #   augmented manifest file.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] document_type
    #   The type of augmented manifest. PlainTextDocument or
    #   SemiStructuredDocument. If you don't specify, the default is
    #   PlainTextDocument.
    #
    #   * `PLAIN_TEXT_DOCUMENT` A document type that represents any unicode
    #     text that is encoded in UTF-8.
    #
    #   * `SEMI_STRUCTURED_DOCUMENT` A document type with positional and
    #     structural context, like a PDF. For training with Amazon
    #     Comprehend, only PDFs are supported. For inference, Amazon
    #     Comprehend support PDFs, DOCX and TXT.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] data_format
    #   The format of your training data:
    #
    #   * `COMPREHEND_CSV`: A two-column CSV file, where labels are provided
    #     in the first column, and documents are provided in the second. If
    #     you use this value, you must provide the `S3Uri` parameter in your
    #     request.
    #
    #   * `AUGMENTED_MANIFEST`: A labeled dataset that is produced by Amazon
    #     SageMaker Ground Truth. This file is in JSON lines format. Each
    #     line is a complete JSON object that contains a training document
    #     and its associated labels.
    #
    #     If you use this value, you must provide the `AugmentedManifests`
    #     parameter in your request.
    #
    #   If you don't specify a value, Amazon Comprehend uses
    #   `COMPREHEND_CSV` as the default.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] s3_uri
    #   The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The S3 bucket must be in the
    #   same Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can
    #   point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for a
    #   collection of input files.
    #
    #   For example, if you use the URI `S3://bucketName/prefix`, if the
    #   prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as input.
    #   If more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses
    #   all of them as input.
    #
    #   This parameter is required if you set `DataFormat` to
    #   `COMPREHEND_CSV`.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] test_s3_uri
    #   This specifies the Amazon S3 location that contains the test

    #   Amazon Web Services Region as the API endpoint that you are calling.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] label_delimiter
    #   Indicates the delimiter used to separate each label for training a
    #   multi-label classifier. The default delimiter between labels is a
    #   pipe (\|). You can use a different character as a delimiter (if
    #   it's an allowed character) by specifying it under Delimiter for
    #   labels. If the training documents use a delimiter other than the
    #   default or the delimiter you specify, the labels on that line will
    #   be combined to make a single unique label, such as LABELLABELLABEL.
    #   @return [String]
    #
    # @!attribute [rw] augmented_manifests
    #   A list of augmented manifest files that provide training data for
    #   your custom model. An augmented manifest file is a labeled dataset
    #   that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth.

    #   `AUGMENTED_MANIFEST`.

    #
    # @!attribute [rw] document_reader_config
    #   Provides configuration parameters to override the default actions
    #   for extracting text from PDF documents and image files.
    #
    #   By default, Amazon Comprehend performs the following actions to
    #   extract text from files, based on the input file type:
    #
    #   * **Word files** - Amazon Comprehend parser extracts the text.
    #
    #   * **Digital PDF files** - Amazon Comprehend parser extracts the
    #     text.
    #
    #   * **Image files and scanned PDF files** - Amazon Comprehend uses the
    #     Amazon Textract `DetectDocumentText` API to extract the text.
    #
    #   `DocumentReaderConfig` does not apply to plain text files or Word
    #   files.
    #
    #   For image files and PDF documents, you can override these default
