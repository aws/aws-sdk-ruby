# A few helpful tips about the Rules file:
#
# * The string given to #compile and #route are matching patterns for
#   identifiers--not for paths. Therefore, you can’t match on extension.
#
# * The order of rules is important: for each item, only the first matching
#   rule is applied.
#
# * Item identifiers start and end with a slash (e.g. “/about/” for the file
#   “content/about.html”). To select all children, grandchildren, … of an
#   item, use the pattern “/about/*/”; “/about/*” will also select the parent,
#   because “*” matches zero or more characters.

    filter :relativize_paths, type: :html

route '*' do
  if item[:extension] == 'md'
    item.identifier + 'index.html'
  else
    item.identifier.chop + '.' + item[:extension]
  end
end

layout '*', :erb
