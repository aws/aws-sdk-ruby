Unreleased Changes
------------------

* Issue - Makes aws-sdk-v1 resilient to security groups long ids. Following the move to longer ids, `AutoScaling::LaunchConfiguration` fails a regex testing the length of `SecurityGroup` ids.

1.67.0 (2017-04-03)
------------------

* Issue - Nokogiri - Removed the version lock on Nokogiri. See the [Nokogiri CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details. Keep in mind that Nokogiri 1.7.1 requires Ruby version 2.1.0 or greater. Customers of Ruby 1.8, 1.9, and 2.0 will not be able to upgrade without version locking Nokogiri and should review for any issues with running on an older version. 

Version 1 of the AWS SDK for Ruby remains end of life - future releases will only address security issues.

1.66.0 (2015-09-04)
------------------

* Issue - AWS::S3 - Resolved an issue where the SDK would not retry errors returned
  from Amazon S3 inside the bodies of 200 status code HTTP responses. This was
  correctly handled for `AWS::S3::Client#complete_multipart_upload`, but
  not for `#copy_part`, and `:copy_object`.

  This fix addresses an issue where managed multipart copies would raise an
  error about a missing etag. These operations should now be retried up to
  three times and raise a terminal error if they are not successful.

  See [related GitHub issue #870](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/issues/870).

  refresh.
