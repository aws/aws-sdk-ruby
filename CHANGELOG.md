Next Release (TBD)
------------------

* Feature - Queue Attributes - `Aws::SQS::Queue` now has getter methods for
  queue attributes that return type-casted values from the `#attributes`
  hash.

  ```ruby
  # before
  queue.attributes['CreatedTimestamp'] #=> '1413825896' (epoc seconds)
  queue.attributes['DelaySeconds'] #=> '60' (string seconds)
  queue.attributes['QueueArn'] #=> 'arn'

  # after
  queue.created_timestamp #=> 2014-10-20 10:24:56 -0700 (Time obj)
  queue.delay_seconds #=> 60 (integer seconds)
  queue.arn #=> 'arn' (without extra queue_ prefix on method)
  ```

* Feature - Assume Role Credentials - Added a credentials class that assumes
  a role via `Aws::STS::Client#assume_role`. Credentials are automatically
  refreshed before the expire:

  ```ruby
  credentials = Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials.new(
    role_arn: 'role-arn',
    role_session_name: 'session-name',
    client: Aws::STS::Client.new(...)
  )
  ```

* Issue - Aws::PageableResponse - Calling `#count` on a pageable response
  was triggering n API calls to get the number of response pages. Instead
  it raises an error now, unless the wrapped data object responds to
  count. Fixes #106.

2.0.3 (2014-10-16)
------------------

* Feature - Amazon RDS - Added support for the 2014-09-01 API version.

* Feature - Pre-signed URLs - Added the ability to generate presigned
  URLs from an `Aws::S3::Object`.

      s3 = Aws::S3::Resource.new
      obj = s3.bucket('aws-sdk').object('key').

      obj.presigned_url(:get)
      #=> "https://bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/object-key?..."

  URLs expire in 15 minutes by default. You can configure the
  expiration period and provide additional params:

      # url expires in one hour, the file upload will be
      # publicly accessible
      obj.presigned_url(:put, expires_in: 3600, acl: 'public-read')

* Feature - HTTP - Added the ability to configure the CA Cert store
  for HTTPs requests.

      Aws.config[:ssl_ca_store] = OpenSSL::X509::Store.new

* Feature - Waiters - Added waiters for Amazon EC2 instance
  instance and system status.

* Feature - Waiters - Added waiters for Amazon EC2 image availability.

* Feature - Waiters - Added `:job_complete` waiter to
  Aws::ElasticTranscoder::Client.

* Feature - Aws::CloudSearch::Client - Added support for configuring advanced
  Japanese language processing.

* Issue - Resolved an issue with the query serializer sending `nil`
  values. See #133.

2.0.2 (2014-10-08)
------------------

* Feature - DynamoDB Document Attributes - Added support for hashes,
  arrays, booleans, and nil to DynamoDB attribute values.

      ddb.put_item(table_name:'name', item: {
        id: 123,
        complex: {
          attributes: true
          lists: ['with', { mixed: true }, 123, 'data'],
        }
      })

* Feature - S3::Object#upload_file - Added a utility method for uploading
  files to Amazon S3. This method automatically manages uploading large
  objects using the multipart upload APIs.

  ```ruby
  s3 = Aws::S3::Resource.new
  s3.bucket('aws-sdk').object('key').upload_file('/path/to/file')
  ```

* Feature - Instance Profile Credentials - Added the ability to configure the
  number of attempts to make when loading instance profile credentials.

  ```ruby
  # makes at most 4 attempts to load credentials
  InstanceProfileCredentials.new(retries:3)
  ```

* Feature - Stubbing Client Responses - Added support for stubbing
  client responses without making API calls. In addition to the
  default fake resposnes, you can provide stub data and errors:

  ```ruby
  s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new(stub_responses: true)
  s3.stub_responses(:list_buckets, buckets:[{name:'aws-sdk'}])
  s3.list_buckets.buckets.map(&:name)
  #=> ['aws-sdk']
  ```

  See API docs for `Aws::Client#stub_responses` for more information.

* Feature - S3 Waiters - Added resource waiters for `S3::Bucket` and
  `S3::Object`.

* Issue - Aws::SQS::Client#receive_message - Resolved an issue where
  the response from `#receive_message` could return `nil` for `#messages`.
  It now always returns an array.

* Issue - Waiters - Resolved an issue with `Aws::EC2::Client#wait_until`
  and the volume status waiters. These were polling the incorrect API
  method causing `#wait_until` to raise an error. See issue #129.

2.0.1 (2014-09-29)
------------------

* Feature - Aws::CognitoIdentity::Client - Added support for Cognito developer identities.

* Issue - Region - Now giving a helpful error message when a region is
  not configured. Was previously exposing a URI parse error message.

2.0.0 (2014-09-25)
------------------

* Feature - S3 Presigned URLs - Added support for pre-signed URLs for
  Amazon S3.

  ```ruby
  presigner = Aws::S3::Presigner.new
  presigner.presigned_url(:put_object, bucket:'aws-sdk', key:'key')
  #=> "https://aws-sdk.s3.amazonaws.com/key?..."
  ```

* Feature - Autoload - Service modules / classes now autoload upon first
  use. This speeds up gem load time significantly.

* Feature - Resources - Resource constructors now pass additional
  options to the Client constructor when `:client` is not provided.

* Issue - SigV4 - Resolved an issue with how version 4 signatures generated
  the normalized querystring. Query params without a value now consistantly
  receive a trailing `=`.

* Issue - SigV4 - Resolved an issue with how version 4 signatures generated
  the normalized querystring. Query params are now sorted by name.

2.0.0.rc16 (2014-09-11)
------------------

* Feature - Waiters - Added a new feature called waiters. Waiters poll a
  single API until a certain condition is matched. Waiters are invoked
  by a name and can be configured.

      # client waiter
      ec2 = Aws::EC2::Client.new
      ec2.wait_until(:instance_stopped, instance_ids:['i-12345678'])

      # resource waiters
      instance = Aws::EC2::Instance.new(id:'i-12345678')
      instance.start
      instance.wait_until_running

  See the client API documentation for `#wait_until` and the resource API
  documentation for `#wait_until_{condition}`.

* Feature - Resources - Merged in resources branch. You can now use 
  resource-oriented interfaces with `Aws::S3`, `Aws::EC2`, `Aws::SQS`,
  `Aws::SNS`, `Aws::Glacier`,
  and `Aws::IAM`.

* Feature - New Gems - Organized the repository into three gems, `aws-sdk`,
  `aws-sdk-resources`, and `aws-sdk-core`. Moved library and test files
  each into their respective gem directories.

* Issue - Error Class Names - Resolved an issue that could raise a
  `NameError`, "wrong constant name" at runtime in response to a service
  error. Fixes #97.

* Issue - `Aws::CloudSearchDomain::Client` - Resolved an issue that would cause
  the `Aws::CloudSearchDomain::Client` constructor to raise an error when
  `Aws.config[:region]` is set. Fixes #103.

* Issue - Shared Credentials - Resolved an issue where an error was raised
  if the shared AWS credentials file is present and is empty or missing the
  default profile. Fixes #104.

2.0.0.rc15 (2014-08-14)
-----------------------

* Feature - `Aws::S3::Client` - Enabling url-encoding of Amazon S3 keys by default.
  Keys are decoded before response data is returned. See [#95](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-core-ruby/issues/95).

* Feature - `Aws::ElasticLoadBalancing::Client` - Added support for the new tagging
  operations.

* Feature - `Aws::CloudSearch::Client` - Will now sign requests when credentials
  are provided. You can continue making unauthenticated requests if you do not
  configure credentials to the client.

* Feature - Coverage - Now generating coverage reports during Travis builds
  and reporting via Coveralls.io.

* Upgrading - `Aws::DynamoDB::Client` - Added a plugin that simplifies working
  with DynamoDB attribute values. Enabled by default, to restore default
  behavior, use `:simple_attributes => false`.

* Issue - Documentation - Now loading API files with UTF-8 encoding.
  See [#92](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-core-ruby/issues/92).

2.0.0.rc14 (2014-08-05)
-----------------------

* Upgrading - Client Classes - Versioned client classes removed, e.g.
  `Aws::S3::Client::V20060301.new` is now `Aws::S3::Client.new` The
  `:api_version` constructor option is no longer accepted.

* Upgrading - `Aws` Module - Helper methods on `Aws` for client classes
  deprecated; For example, calling `Aws.s3` will generate a deprecation
  warning. Use `Aws::S3::Client.new` instead. Helpers will be removed as
  of v2.0.0 final.

* Upgrading - Config - When configuring an `:endpoint`, you must now specify
  the HTTP scheme, e.g. "http://localhost:3000", instead of "localhost:3000".

2.0.0.rc1 - 2.0.0.rc13
----------------------

* No changelog entries.
