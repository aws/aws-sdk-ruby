  * lib/aws/rails.rb: Make possible to use without ActionMailer

  I use aws-sdk with background uploading queue, so it makes sense to turn off
  any unused Rails libraries. It's possible to turn off every Rails specific
  libraries except ActionMailer, so it works:


  ```ruby
  config.frameworks -= [ :active_record, :active_resource, :action_controller,
  :action_view]
  ```

  But it doesn't work

  ```ruby
  config.frameworks -= [:action_mailer]
  ```

  The fix makes sure that you load ActionMailer to use it with SNS

  * lib/aws/core/configuration.rb, lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb,
  spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb: Verify content-length for
  Net::HTTP responses.

  Some downloads from Amazon S3 can be truncated, and Net::HTTP
  does not check response body size against the content-length
  specified in the response header. This change adds such a check,
  which can be toggled on or off (on by default) in the AWS.config.

  * lib/aws/sns/message.rb: Add accessors for Token and SubscribeURL

  * lib/aws/s3/client.rb, spec/aws/s3/client_spec.rb:
  AWS::S3::Client#put_bucket_website now omits empty routing rules.

  This resolves an issue where passing `:routing_rules => []` to the
  client would result in an error returned from Amazon S3.  S3 does
  not accept `<RoutingRules/>`.

  Fixes #308

  * lib/aws/core.rb: Update documentation for AWS.memoize.

  AWS.memoize documentation incorrectly stated that memoize was

  * lib/aws/record/abstract_base.rb, lib/aws/record/hash_model.rb,

  * lib/aws/record/abstract_base.rb, lib/aws/record/attributes.rb,
  spec/aws/record/model/instance_methods_spec.rb,
  spec/shared/record/instance_examples.rb: AWS::Record now accepts default
  values set via a proc.

  By using a Proc, you can ensure every record has a different default value.
  For example:

      class Book < AWS::Record::HashModel
        string_attr :isbn, :default_value => lambda {
  UUIDTools::UUID.random_create }
      end

  * lib/aws/record/abstract_base.rb, lib/aws/record/hash_model.rb,
  lib/aws/record/validator.rb,
  spec/aws/record/hash_model/class_methods_spec.rb: AWS::Record::HashModel now
  accepts mutable hash keys.

  The default behavior for a class extending `AWS::Record::HashModel` is to
  have a managed `#id` attribute.  This attribute is auto-generated before
  creation.  It is set to a random UUID.

  You can now override this behavior with the `:hash_key` option.  When you do
  this,
  the HashModel's hash key will no longer be managed (no default values).

  * lib/aws/record/abstract_base.rb, lib/aws/record/model.rb: Moved the static
  #id attribute logic from AWS::Record::AbstractBase into Model.

  In order to allow a dynamic hash key, we don't want the extra baggage of
  a fixed attribute name.

  hash key:

      class Book < AWS::Record::HashModel

  * lib/aws/core/region_collection.rb: Add proxy support to AWS regions
  enumeration.

  region_collection.rb did not attempt to use proxies even when
  specified in the AWS config. This change adds a proxy check,
  and uses a proxy when available.

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db/client.rb: Udpated documentation reference to the

  * lib/aws/core/credential_providers.rb,
  spec/aws/core/credential_providers_spec.rb, spec/mock-credential-file.txt:
  Read credentials from AWS_CREDENTIAL_FILE environment variable.

  * bin/aws-rb: Added a -e option to aws-rb.

  You can now execute commands using aws-rb.  Passing commands
  with the -e option will prevent the REPL from launching and will
  exit instead.  You can pass multiple -e options.

      aws-rb -q -e "puts AWS.s3.buckets.map(&:name)"

  The script above would put the name of each bucket to STDOUT and
  then exit.  The -q flag (quiet) disables logging.

  function call. This was inconsistent but didn't break tests.

  Had integration test regressions regarding some option types.
  This change addresses that regression.

  * lib/aws/s3/presigned_post.rb, spec/aws/s3/presigned_post_spec.rb: Allow
  arbitrary options for presigned post.

  Presigned Posts to S3 previously hard coded a set of allowable
  parameters, this change permits users to send arbitrary params
  which are then passed on to S3.

  Resolves #250

  * lib/aws/core.rb, lib/aws/core/region.rb, tasks/docs.rake: Updated
  documentation for service helpers.

  * lib/aws/core.rb, lib/aws/core/configuration.rb, lib/aws/core/region.rb,
  tasks/docs.rake: Renamed helper methods for AWS::SimpleEmailService and
  AWS::SimpleWorkflow.

  To be consistent with other services that use the official service
  abbreviation,
  the helper methods on `AWS` and `AWS::Core::Region` now use the short names
  for
  `AWS::SimpleEmailService` and `AWS::SimpleWorkflow`.

      # new methods
      AWS.ses
      AWS.swf
      AWS.regions['us-west-2'].ses
      AWS.regions['us-west-2'].swf

      # deprecated methods
      AWS.simple_email_service
      AWS.simple_workflow
      AWS.regions['us-west-2'].simple_email_service
      AWS.regions['us-west-2'].simple_workflow

  Additionally global configuration options use the short name.

      AWS.config(:ses => {...})
      AWS.config(:swf => {...})

  * lib/aws/core/configuration.rb, spec/aws/core/client_spec.rb: You can now
  specify endpoint, region and port per service via AWS.config(:svc => { ...
  })

  You can specify global options per service now using the new configuration
  options.
  Example:

      AWS.config(:s3 => { :region => 'us-west-2' })

      AWS::S3.new.config.s3_region
      #=> 'us-west-2'

  * lib/aws/core/configuration.rb, spec/aws/config_spec.rb: Each service now
  hash a top-level configuration entry.

  Each service now has a config option, for example:

      AWS.config.s3
      #=> {}

  You can specify the value like any other configuration option:

      AWS.config(:s3 => { 'abc' => 'xyz' })

  These values are not yet used anywhere.  They will eventually
  be merged with the root level configuration options when building
  a client.

  * lib/aws/route_53/resource_record_set.rb: Don't nuke attributes on
  ResourceRecordSet update

  Previously, if you were not changing the name, type, or set identifier, they
  would be destructively removed from the ResourceRecordSet on update.

  * lib/aws/route_53/resource_record_set.rb: Add failover and health check
  attributes

  * features/sns/message.feature, features/sqs/step_definitions/messages.rb:
  Added integration tests for AWS::SNS::Message#authentic?

  References #61

  * spec/aws/sns/message_spec.rb: Made the pending test for
  AWS::SNS::Message#authentic? pass.

  References #61

  * lib/aws/sns/message.rb: AWS::SNS::Message now uses Net::HTTP instead of
  HTTParty.

  HTTParty is no longer a dependency of the SDK.

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db/client.rb, spec/aws/dynamo_db/client_versions_spec.rb:
  You can now configure a global default API version.

  If you want to specify the default API version, you can do so
  using AWS.config:

      # normally defaults to 2011-12-05
      AWS::DynamoDB::Client.new
      #=> AWS::DyanmoDB::Client::V20111205

      AWS.config(:dynamo_db => { :api_version => '2012-08-10')

      # now defaults to 2012-08-10
      AWS::DynamoDB::Client.new
      #=> AWS::DyanmoDB::Client::V20120810

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db/client.rb, spec/aws/dynamo_db/client_versions_spec.rb:
  Fixed an issue constructing clients from their versioned class.

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db/client.rb: Documented the DynamoDB client with
  instructions on using the :api_version option.

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db/client.rb, lib/aws/dynamo_db/client/v20111205.rb,
  lib/aws/dynamo_db/client/v20120810.rb: Added documentation to the versioned
  DynamoDB::Clients.

  lib/aws/dynamo_db/client/v20111205.rb,
  lib/aws/dynamo_db/client/v20120810.rb, lib/aws/dynamo_db/client_base.rb,
  lib/aws/dynamo_db/client_v2.rb, spec/aws/dynamo_db/client_versions_spec.rb:
  AWS::DynamoDB::Client now supports both Amazon DynamoDB API versions.

  `AWS::DynamoDB::ClientV2` is now deprecated.  Instead of using this class,
  you can
  construct a client of a specific version like so:

      ddb = AWS::DynamoDB::Client.new(:api_version => '2012-08-10')

  Constructing a client without an API version returns a client of the oldest
  version.  This ensures existing users of AWS::DynamoDB::Client will not
  experience
  runtime errors from the differences.

  This works by turning AWS::DynamoDB::Client.new into a factory method.  It
  returns
  an instance of Client::V20111005 or Client::V20120810 based on the
  :api_version
  option.

  * spec/aws/config_spec.rb, spec/aws/core/client_spec.rb,
  spec/aws/core/region_spec.rb: Updated specs to use the new AWS::SERVICES
  format.

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db/client.rb, lib/aws/dynamo_db/client_v2.rb: Updated
  client API documentation for both Amazon DynamoDB clients.

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db/client.rb: Added whitespace in client documentation to
  ensure nested lists render correctly.

  * lib/aws/record/hash_model.rb, spec/aws/record/hash_model_spec.rb: Fix bug
  with hash_key

  * lib/aws/record/hash_model.rb: Allow setting hash_key

  When creating the dynamo_db_table instance the hash_key defaults to id.
  This patch allows assigning a string attribute as the id.

  * lib/aws/core.rb: add AWS.reset_memoization method

  * lib/aws/sns/message.rb, spec/aws/sns/message_spec.rb:
  AWS::SNS::Message#authentic? no longer flattens errors.

  Errors raised when trying to validate the SNS message were
  getting replaced with a generic message and a StandardError.
  If it fails 3 times, the original error will now raise through.

  * lib/aws/sns/message.rb: Resolved an issue with AWS::SNS::Mesage and Ruby
  versions < 2.0.

  * spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb: Pending specs for more
  reasonable streaming behaviour

  Previously, errors in subsequent chunks were caught and then the whole
  request was retried, yielding (possibly) repeated chunks to the
  read_block, without any indication (in the block) of this being done.

  The outer client method would also not report any errors for a consumer
  to check.

  * spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb: Add specs for streaming http
  responses

2013-07-02 Trevor Rowe <trevorrowe@gmail.com>

  * spec/aws_spec.rb: Updated unit tests to not rely on return value from

  * Gemfile: Use HTTPS when talking to rubygems.org.

  * lib/aws/route_53/change_batch.rb: Expose failover + health check id in
  ChangeRequest

  * lib/aws/core.rb, spec/require_test_3.rb: Reverted the return value from

  * lib/aws/iam/virtual_mfa_device.rb,
  spec/aws/iam/virtual_mfa_device_spec.rb: Resolved an issue with
  AWS::IAM::VirtualMFADevice#enable.

  Passing in string values for a code like '099999' were raising
  runtime errors from sprintf.  This change prevents string values
  from getting passed through sprintf.  Added a test to cover this
  behavior.

  Fixes #288

  * lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb,
  spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb: Capture OpenSSL errors, to

2013-06-26 Gustav Munkby <grddev@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb: Change HTTP handler to whitelist
  network errors

  Instead of (dangerously) whitelisting errors to reraise, this changes
  the HTTP handler to explicitly list the raised exceptions for which the
  exceptions should be swallowed.

  Fundamentally, this changes handling of unknown errors (such as any Java
  error in JRuby) to not be swallowed.

  * lib/aws/simple_email_service.rb, spec/aws/simple_email_service_spec.rb:
  Added test for setting message id on raw messages.

  When calling `AWS::SimpleEmailService#send_raw_message` with an
  object that responds to `#message_id=`, then the message ID
  from the SES response will be set on the raw message.

  Added a missing test and corrected the `#responds_to?` check.

  Some AWS users cannot access the AZ us-east-1a, making them
  unable to run our full Cucumber test suite. This change
  removes us-east-1a from the Cucumber integration tests, replacing
  with us-east-1b or other AZs as appropriate.

  * features/auto_scaling/step_definitions/groups.rb,
  lib/aws/auto_scaling/group_options.rb,
  spec/aws/auto_scaling/group_collection_spec.rb: Add termination_options to

  in S3.

  The next_markers method in object_collection.rb for S3 did not reference the
  "next_marker" property, causing issues when the contents.last value was
  missing.

  Added Cucumber/RSpec tests to cover this case, added a check for next_marker
  to object_collection.rb, and refactored the marker selection logic to be
  more
  readable.

  * spec/aws/s3/access_control_list_spec.rb,
  spec/aws/s3/presigned_post_spec.rb, spec/spec_helper.rb, tasks/rspec.rake:
  Added a task to run each spec file in its own process.

  Updated a few specs that were failing when run directly.

  * spec/require_test_1.rb, spec/require_test_2.rb, tasks/rspec.rake: Added
  addition tests around loading the SDK.

  Because the SDK uses autoload, it is necessary to run these
  tests in separate processes.

  * lib/aws/ec2/instance.rb, spec/aws/ec2/instance_spec.rb: Resolved an issue
  with AWS::EC2::Instance#console_output

  When the output xml element is missing from the response to
  GetConsoleOutput then this method was raising an error.  This
  now returns +nil+ indicating the output is not available.

  Fixes #272

2013-06-12 Trevor Rowe <trevorrowe@gmail.com>

  * aws-sdk.gemspec, bin/aws-rb, bin/aws-sdk-repl: Renamed the aws-sdk-repl to
  aws-rb.

  * Renamed the script
  * Updated the gem specification executables
  * Renamed the ENV prefix from AWS_SDK_REPL to AWSRB

  * bin/aws-sdk-repl: Changed the usage banner to match the (current)
  executable name.

  * bin/aws-sdk-repl: Modified the repl include and require options.

  * Now requiring the aws-sdk gem after the $LOAD_PATH
    has been amended.  This allows the user to point
    the repl to a different version of the SDK.

  * Now requiring any files specified via -r. This happens
    after the SDK has been loaded and configured.  This
    alows the required library to make use of the SDK.

  * bin/aws-sdk-repl: Corrected spelling error in comment.

  * .gitignore, Gemfile, aws-sdk.gemspec, bin/aws-sdk-repl: Added a basic repl
  executable as aws-sdk-repl.

  This repl will default to pry when available, but will
  fall back to irb when not available.  It accepts a number
  of runtime configuration options and defaults can be exported
  to ENV.

  By default client requests are logged (in color).  A quick
  example:

      aws-sdk-repl
      AWS> s3.buckets['aws-sdk'].objects['key'].content_length
      [AWS S3 200 0.875184 0 retries]
  head_object(:bucket_name=>"aws-sdk",:key=>"key")
      => 5242881

  You can use all methods of the AWS module directly when using Pry.

      AWS.config(:dynamo_db_crc_32_check => false) # oops, wont apply

      AWS::DynamoDB # autoload dynamo db service interface

  The S3 signature requries the content-md5 and content-type headers to be
  signed.  The #url_for helper method previously did not accept these two
  values and therefore was only good for requests where these values
  were not specified.

  You can now specify them like so:

      s3.buckets['bucket-name'].objects['key'].url_for(:write, {
        # both of these are optional
        :content_type => 'text/plain',

2013-04-22 Trevor Rowe <trevorrowe@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/elastic_beanstalk.rb, lib/aws/elastic_transcoder.rb,
  spec/aws/core/region_spec.rb: Fixed a few test issues with the new service
  shortcuts.

  * lib/aws/core.rb, tasks/docs.rake: Added service shortcuts from AWS.

  You can now create service interfaces directly from AWS like so:

      ec2 = AWS.ec2

  You can pass configuration options to this instance as well:

      ec2 = AWS.ec2(:region => 'us-west-2')

  Updated docs rake task to document these magic methods.

  * README.md: Updated README examples.

  * lib/aws/core.rb, tasks/docs.rake: Added additional rake tasks for updating
  docs.

  The API documentation contains lists of supported
  services and service classes.  A pair of rake tasks
  have been added that will update these lists when
  docs are built to ensure they do not get stale.

  * README.md, README.rdoc: Translated README from rdoc to markdown,
  restructured content.

  * ChangeLog, lib/aws/version.rb: Bump version to 1.9.1

  * lib/aws/core/http/connection_pool.rb,
  lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb: Fixed a bug introduced in 1.9.0
  related to http continue timeouts.

  Ruby < 1.9.3 does not support setting the continue timeout on
  a `Net::HTTP session`.  Now guarding that attribute assignment
  with a `responds_to?` check.

  Fixes #232

  AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface#private_ip_addresses.

  Resolves #230

  * lib/aws/core/client.rb: Improved retry logic for throttling errors and
  expired credentials.

  * Added additional error types to the list of throttling errors.
  * Added invalid credential errors to those that need to be
    retried as expired creds

  When account credentials are rotated they (the old/invalid) credentials
  return a different error than when session credentials expire.  Now
  catching invalid account credential errors and retrying them once
  (after asking the credential provider to refresh).

  Simplified the connection pool and addressed a few issues.

  The default http handler (AWS::Core::Http::NetHttpHandler) used
  internally a Net::Http::ConnectionPool class.  This was refactored
  (and renamed to AWS::Core::Http::ConnectionPool).

  * ConnectionPool.new will now return a previously build (shared)
    pool for the same options.

  * ConnectionPool.new now tracks all pools, and you can get a list
    of them from ConnectionPool.pools.

  * Moved Net::HTTP patch into aws/core/http/patch (this fixes
    100-continue bug in 1.9.3 and 2.0.0)

  As part of this refactor a handful of configuration options were
  removed from AWS::Core::Http::Request (e.g. ssl_ca_file, proxy_uri,
  etc).  These attributes are now passed to the ConnectionPool
  constructor instead and not tracked on each http request.

2013-04-12 Trevor Rowe <trevorrowe@gmail.com>

  * spec/aws/s3/client_spec.rb: Fixed xml matching in S3 client spec.

  * lib/aws/rails.rb: Simplified Rails version detection.

  * lib/aws/s3/client.rb: Now using Nokogiri::XML::Builder instead of REXML in
  AWS::S3::Client.

  Converted a few final locations in the S3 client that built XML
  incorrectly using REXML (now using the nokogiri xml builder).  These
  locations did not correctly escape xml values in all situations.

  Fixes #118

  * features/cloud_front/client.feature,
  features/cloud_front/step_definitions/client.rb,
  lib/aws/cloud_front/request.rb: Added support for session credentials to
  AWS::CloudFront.

  The AWS::CloudFront::Request class was ignoring session
  tokens when signing the request.  This caused Cloud Front
  to return cyrptic errors.  Now setting the 'x-amz-session-token'
  header when the credentials contain a session token.

  Fixes #227

  * lib/aws/ec2/instance_collection.rb,
  spec/aws/ec2/instance_collection_spec.rb:
  AWS::EC2::InstanceCollection#create now accepts :block_device_mappings in
  the same format aws AWS::EC2::Client#run_instances.

  Previously it expected a hash option and then it would
  create the array of hashes required by #run_instances.  It
  now only translates when a hash is given and it passes arrays
  along un-modified.

  Fixes #210

  * lib/aws/api_config/CloudFront-2012-07-01.yml,
  lib/aws/cloud_front/client.rb: Updated AWS::CloudFront::Client to the
  2012-07-01 api version.

  "expect" and waiting for 100-continue.

  Added two new configuration options to AWS.config:

  * :http_continue_timeout (time in seconds, defaults to 1)
  * :http_continue_threshold (size in bytes, defaults false)

  If a request body exceeds the :http_continue_threshold, then the
  "Expect" header will be set to "100-continue".  The http client will
  then wait for a "100 Continue" response or :http_continue_timeout
  seconds before sending the body.

  By default the :http_continue_timeout is set to 1 seconds and the
  :http_continue_threshold is disabled (set to false).

  To enable 100-continues you need to do 2 things:

  * Call `AWS.patch_net_http_100_continue!`
  * Set `:http_continue_threshold` to a positive integer (number of bytes)

  can be used as a shortcut for getting region specific clients.

      east = AWS.regions['us-east-1']
      west = AWS.regions['us-west-1']

      east.ec2.instances.map(&:id)
      west.ec2.instances.map(&:id)

  You can also explore available regions using AWS.regions:

      # makes a single (cached) http request to get a complete list of regions
      AWS.regions.each do |region|
        puts region.name
      end

  lib/aws/storage_gateway/config.rb, spec/aws/core/cacheable_spec.rb: Added
  support for a single configurable region.

  You can now specify what AWS region you want to connect to:

      AWS.config(:region => 'us-west-2')

  The individual configuration options for each service endpoints are
  now deprecated.  If you want to override the endpoint for a service
  you can do so in the constructor:

      AWS::S3.new(:region => 'us-east-1')

      # this also works
      AWS::S3.new(:endpoint => 's3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com')

  Documentation changes were made to remove mention of the now
  deprecated options.

  * lib/aws/cloud_search.rb: Correct copy pasted documentation

  * spec/aws/cloud_search_spec.rb: Add spec for CloudSearch

  Permit bucket names that follow the less restrictive naming rules specified
  in
  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/2006-03-01/dev/BucketRestrictions.html
  but restrict dns compatible names to the more restrictive rules in the same
  document.

  * lib/aws/route_53/resource_record_set.rb: Add some documentation.

  * lib/aws/route_53/resource_record_set.rb: Factor out ChangeRequest creation
  into methods.

  This makes it easier to create more complex change batches that
  encompass the deletion or update of multiple resource record sets.

  Also, in update(), don't clear out @create_options until after the
  change batch is actually called. Otherwise the object's state will be
  mutated even if the batch raises for some reason.

  * lib/aws/core/http/curb_handler.rb: Added support to the CurbHandler for

  The AWS::Core::Http::CurbHandler is a drop-in replacement for the
  net/http based default handler.  The curb-based handler did not
  previously support a block for streading response data from the
  response directly.  Instead it was buffering the entire response
  into memory (and emitting a warning).

  spec/aws/s3/multipart_upload_spec.rb: Fixed an issue with the stubbed

  A number of tests that should have failed were passing because the
  simulate response for #complete_multipart upload was puttin in a nil
  value for :version_id.  The version id actually should only be present
  when not-nil.

  * lib/aws/s3/multipart_upload.rb: Fix undefined method 'version_id' during
  multipart upload

  * lib/aws/core/credential_providers.rb,
  spec/aws/core/credential_providers_spec.rb: Fix bug: default credential
  provider hides sub credential provider's fetching
  credentials error.

  The default credential provider will try to rescue sub provider's
  MissingCredentialsError for looking up the right credential provider.
  However, the way using 'rescue' keyword is not correct, and it
  actually rescued all the StandardError raised from sub provider's
  credentials method.

  * lib/aws/core/credential_providers.rb: missing require time lib for
  Time.parse is used in EC2Provider, the test passed because there is an
  example required the time lib

  Removing deprecated usage of nested Given/When/Then from features.

  * Gemfile, features/support/common.rb: Removed a few un-needed test
  dependencies and updated others.

  * lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb: Fixed spec broken by NetHttpHandler
  update for network errors.

  Ruby 1.8 extends Timeout::Errors from SingalError instead of StandardError.
  A recent commit (bcd98dbc579e9d520dadffe9911c64743a4ce082) caused
  SignalErrors to get passed through.  We are now catching Timeout::Error
  before this, so they can be treated as network errors and retried.

  * lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb, lib/aws/core/http/response.rb,
  spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb:
  AWS::Core::Http::Response#network_error now returns the error instead of a
  boolean.

  The #network_error? method still returns true/false values, but
  the #network_error method now returns the raised error object or nil.

  * lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb,
  spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb: Increased the number of Errors
  retried by the NetHttpHandler.

  Previously, only a short white-list of errors were trapped and
  retried as networking errors.  This has been expanded to be
  all errors raised from the handler (and Net::HTTP) except for
  those on a pass-through list.  This should minimize the number of
  un-enuemrated errors that don't get retried (like open ssl socket
  errors).

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db/item_collection.rb: Corrected documentation on
  AWS::DynamoDB::ItemCollection#select on how to :limit

  * spec/aws/simple_workflow/decision_task_spec.rb: Spec for allowing
  workflow_id parameters to some decider methods

  * lib/aws/simple_workflow/decision_task.rb: Allow
  signal_external_workflow_execution and
  request_cancel_external_workflow_execution to accept a String workflow id as
  the first parameter. This is consistent with the current documentation.

  * lib/aws/iam/resource.rb: Removed @private doc tag from AWS::IAM::Resource.

  This will cause the #exists? method to appear in the docs
  for the various IAM resource classes.

  Fixes #128.

  Added support for website redirect location to S3 client.

  Also DRY'd up parsing responses for s3 object methods,
  created a single method that extracts s3 object information
  from the http response headers.  Simplified parsing responses
  for a number of object methods (GET, HEAD, PUT, etc).

  * lib/aws/core/rest_response_parser.rb, spec/aws/glacier/client_spec.rb:
  Added support for Glacier::Client#get_job_output.

  spec/shared/ec2/collection_array_access_examples.rb,
  spec/shared/ec2/collection_examples.rb: Fixed a bug in AWS::EC2::Region
  where #client had a miss-configured ec2 endpoint.

  EC2 regions provide access to resources in other regions, e.g.

    ec2.regions['us-west-2'].instances.map(&:id)

  There was an issue where all EC2 service methods were correctly proxied
  to the new region *except* for the #client.  Here is a demonstration of
  that bug:

    ec2.regions['us-west-2'].client.config.ec2_endpoint
    #=> 'ec2.amazonaws.com'

  This should have returned 'ec2.us-west-2.amazonaws.com'.  This patch
  resolves this issue and updates a few incorrect tests.

  * samples/ec2/run_instance.rb: Updated EC2 example to use a less-aggressive
  polling delay for instance state change.

  * .travis.yml: Disabling ruby 1.9.3 due to bug in latest patch level.

  * lib/aws/ec2/security_group/ip_permission.rb: Don't munge port ranges that
  are already Ranges.

  For ranges with first > last, Array(range) yields [], causing port_range
  to be set to 0..0. The API returns IpPermission objects with port_range
  set to things like 0..-1 or 8..-1 for specific ICMP packet types. These
  were previously impossible to create using IpPermission::new.

  It was also rather silly to be creating and immediately garbage
  collecting two arrays (e.g. for 0..65535) when we really want the range.

  features/sqs/step_definitions/messages.rb, lib/aws/sqs/queue.rb,
  spec/aws/sqs/queue_spec.rb: Implement SQS long polling

  Changes within AWS::SQS:

  * Queue#poll now accept a :wait_time_seconds parameter which sets the
    maximum amount of time that SQS should long poll for.
    Defaults to 15 seconds. To use the default set for all messages
    on the queue, pass in nil.
  * The :wait_time_seconds default does not apply to
    Queue#receive_message. For this method, you must pass the option
    directly, or set the global Queue#wait_time_seconds long polling
    value.
  * Added Queue#wait_time_seconds attribute to set the queue-wide
    long poll timeout value. This setting applies to all calls to
    Queue#receive_message or Queue#poll
  * Deprecates the Queue::DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL constant
  * Queue#poll no longer uses :poll_interval; use :wait_time_seconds
    instead.

2012-07-26 Peter Mounce <pete@neverrunwithscissors.com>

  * lib/aws/sns/message.rb, lib/aws/sns/originators/from_auto_scaling.rb,
  spec/aws/sns/originators/from_auto_scaling_spec.rb,
  spec/aws/sns/support/sns_as_instance_launch.json,
  spec/aws/sns/support/sns_as_instance_terminate.json: Add support for Message
  finding out its own origin.

  Introduce the concept of a message's origin, and introduce a partial
  implementation of
  an AutoScaling originator (partial, in that there's not coverage for all of
  the data that
  auto-scaling will include in the SNS' body).

  The origin-selection currently works simply; there's only one originator at
  present, so
  it's checked in-line in Message's initializer, rather than that iterating
  through the
  available originator modules.

  * lib/aws/sns.rb, lib/aws/sns/message.rb, spec/aws/sns/message_spec.rb,
  spec/aws/sns/support/sns_manually_sent.json: Add AWS::SNS::Message and
  build-in authenticity-checking.

  AWS::SNS::Message#authentic? will return true if the message is
  cryptographically authenticated
  (see
  http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/sns/latest/gsg/SendMessageToHttp.verify.si
  gnature.html).
  To-do:
  * support subscription-confirmation and unsubscribe messages; this just
  supports
  notifications.  Should just mean changes to canonical_string method.
  * decide whether it's really OK to return false in the event of the check
  throwing an error (for
  example, if the cert-download fails too often or times out).  Might be best
  to leave that up to
  the caller?
