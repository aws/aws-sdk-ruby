  This release of the Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) introduces
  support
  for copying DB snapshots from one AWS region to another. The release also
  includes a new Amazon RDS API version, 2013-09-09.

  * features/s3/high_level/step_definitions/urls.rb,

  Example:

      bucket.objects['target-key'].url_for(:write, :acl => :public_read)

  Fixes #412

2013-11-20 Trevor Rowe <trevorrowe@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/s3/s3_object.rb, spec/aws/s3/s3_object_encrypt_spec.rb,
  spec/aws/s3/s3_object_spec.rb: A fix/workaround for streaming encrypted IO
  objects via S3.

  The `AWS::S3::CipherIO` class has a bug that causes it to report
  `#eof?` before reaching the end of the stream if `#read` is called
  with a number of bytes not divisible by 16.

  This patch works around this limitation by causing the multipart
  uploader to always use part sizes evenly divisible by 16.  CipherIO
  is a private/undocumented class, but this is a shim.  CipherIO
  should be updated to properly work when `#read` is called on the
  non-final chunk with an odd number of bytes.

  The underlying cause is the internal encryption cipher
  buffers internally and only returns values 16 bytes at a time.
  Using an internal buffer in CipherIO could solve this problem.

  Fixes #414

  * lib/aws/core/rest_request_builder.rb, lib/aws/s3/data_options.rb: Fixed a
  bug with Ruby 1.8 and how StringIO#path.

  It was assumed that IO objects responding to `#path` could be
  given to `File.size`.  This is incorrect for Ruby 1.8.7, where
  `StringIO` responds to `#path`, returning `nil`.

  This check has been expanded to responds to path and path not nil.

2013-11-19 Trevor Rowe <trevorrowe@gmail.com>

  * Gemfile: Added a nokogiri dependendency to the Gemfile for local
  development.

  This allows the travis-ci build for 1.8.7 to install Nokogiri < 1.6
  which is required for unit tests.

  * lib/aws/cloud_watch/request.rb: Updating AWS::CloudWatch to use sigv4.

  * lib/aws/core/rest_request_builder.rb, lib/aws/s3/data_options.rb: Now
  using File.size to determine file size for File/Tempfile objects.

  It is possible for a File/Tempfile to report an incorrect value
  from `#size`.  This change causes the SDK to prefer the response
  from `File.size(file.path)` over `file.size`.

  caller,
  the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the AWS
  service.

  * lib/aws/auto_scaling/scheduled_action.rb,
  lib/aws/auto_scaling/scheduled_action_collection.rb,
  spec/aws/auto_scaling/scheduled_action_collection_spec.rb,
  spec/aws/auto_scaling/scheduled_action_spec.rb: Fixed a bug with AutoScaling
  scheduled actions.

  The `AWS::AutoScaling::ScheduledAction` class incorrectly assumed that their
  group names were unique and suffient to identify the action.  In order to
  correct
  this bug, it was required to add a new positional required argument to the
  `ScheduledAction` constructor.  This affects two code paths.

  First, the scheduled action collection must now be scoped by a group:

      # now raises an error, must scope to a group first
      auto_scaling.scheduled_actions['name']

      # this works
      auto_scaling.groups['group-name'].scheduled_actions['name']

      # this also works
      auto_scaling.scheduled_actions.filter(:group => 'group-name')['name']

  Also the constructor now requires a group:

      # no longer works, raises error
      AWS::AutoScaling::ScheduledAction.new('name')

      # this works
      group = AWS::AutoScaling::Group.new('group-name')
      AWS::AutoScaling::ScheduledAction.new(group, 'name')

  Update for Amazon EC2

  Updates AWS::EC2::Client to support public IPs in VPC, and an optional
  dry run flag.

  * lib/aws/core/configuration.rb, spec/aws/dynamo_db_spec.rb: Test failure
  fixes for DynamoDB.

  The way we dealt with the configuration in the previous change on
  DynamoDB clients had knock on effects to clients of, for example,
  Simple Email Service. Fixed those, and updated tests for DynamoDB
  to handle the different way we instantiate its client.

  * features/dynamo_db/step_definitions/versioning.rb,
  features/dynamo_db/versioning.feature, lib/aws/core/configuration.rb,
  lib/aws/dynamo_db.rb: Make AWS::DynamoDB use legacy client.

  The higher level abstractions provided for DynamoDB only work fully with
  the legacy version of the low-level client. This change forces the higher
  level abstractions to fall back to the legacy client API, but allows use of
  the new client-level API directly.

  * lib/aws/s3/object_metadata.rb, lib/aws/s3/s3_object.rb: Deprecated
  AWS::S3::ObjectMetadata#[]=

  Marked AWS::S3::ObjectMetadata#[]= as deprecated and updated documentation
  to include a warning note on unexpected changes to metadata and values it
  does not set. Updated AWS::S3::S3Object#copy_from documentation to explain
  risks of setting metadata hash without copying previous values.

  Resolves Issue #325

2013-08-23 Alex Wood <awood45@gmail.com>

  * spec/aws/dynamo_db/table_spec.rb: Make AWS::DynamoDB::Table tests support
  1.8.7

  Ruby 1.8.7 doesn't support Time.new with parameters. Using Time.now
  instead since that is sufficient for the cases covered.

  * features/dynamo_db/step_definitions/tables.rb,
  features/dynamo_db/tables.feature, lib/aws/dynamo_db/table.rb,
  spec/aws/dynamo_db/table_spec.rb: Add high level methods to
  AWS::DynamoDB::Table

  Adds item_count and size_bytes to the Amazon DynamoDB high level
  abstraction layer. Relevant Cucumber and RSpec tests included to
  make the process of adding these for later releases a little easier.

2013-08-22 Jon <jonathan.j.mason@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/sqs/errors.rb: Update documentation for BatchSendError.

  Note that the previous documentation was copied from
  BatchChangeVisibilityError and contained inaccuracies.

  * lib/aws/sqs/queue.rb, spec/aws/sqs/queue_spec.rb: Add body and index to
  BatchSendError.failures

  * Add :message_body and :batch_index to entries in BatchSendError.failures.

  * Updates specs to reflect this

  Updates specs to reflect the changes.

  * lib/aws/core/xml/sax_handlers/nokogiri.rb, lib/aws/s3/client.rb,
  lib/aws/s3/client/xml.rb, spec/aws/s3/client_spec.rb: Add AWS::S3::Client
  Bucket Logging Methods

  Adds the following methods and associated tests:
  AWS::S3::Client#get_bucket_logging
  AWS::S3::Client#put_bucket_logging

  Also adds a method to the Nokogiri Sax Handler to handle comments
  in XML by ignoring them.

  * spec/aws/s3/client_spec.rb, spec/aws/simple_email_service_spec.rb,
  spec/aws/sqs/queue_spec.rb, spec/shared/aws_client_examples.rb: Replaced
  #stub! calls with #stub to silence rspec deprecation warnings.

  * lib/aws/core/configuration.rb, spec/aws_spec.rb: Resolved an issue where
  config might get stuck in a recursive loop.

  When building a service endpoint, the region is used to construct the
  default endpoint.  When attempting to determine the region, the endpoint
  is is parsed (recursive loop).

  The recent patch to make endpoint use the svc region instead of the global
  region uncovered this bug.  This patch stops the loops by changing the logic
  in #svc_endpoint to used only the explicitly configured regions, and never
  a region guessed from the endpoint.

  * lib/aws/core/configuration.rb, spec/aws_spec.rb: Fixed an issue around
  configuring endpoints by service region.

  * Gemfile: Loosened the rspec version dependency.

2013-08-13 Trevor Rowe <trevorrowe@gmail.com>

  * spec/aws/s3/s3_object_encrypt_spec.rb, spec/spec_helper.rb: Updated a spec
  to work with a newer version of rspec.

  * lib/aws/sqs/errors.rb, lib/aws/sqs/queue.rb, spec/aws/sqs/queue_spec.rb:
  Add MD5 validation for Amazon SQS.

  When available, validates SQS operations against MD5 checksums,
  raising errors when there are mismatches.

2013-08-14 Alex Wood <awood45@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/core/configuration.rb: Remove SQS checksum verification from
  global config.

  Accidentally left the old location of :sqs_validate_checksums
  out of the pull request. Removing the old version, tests still
  pass.

  * lib/aws/core.rb, lib/aws/core/configuration.rb, lib/aws/sqs/config.rb,
  lib/aws/sqs/queue.rb: Configuration toggle for SQS MD5 check.

  Adds :sqs_verify_checksums to the AWS config. True by default,
  setting this value to false will skip the validation of MD5
  checksums for SQS operations.

2013-08-12 Alex Wood <awood45@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/version.rb: Bump version to 1.15.0

  * ChangeLog, spec/aws/emr/instance_group_collection_spec.rb,
  spec/aws/emr/instance_group_spec.rb: Fix EMR spec stubbing.

  JSON stubbing is not as sophisticated as XML stubbing, added missing
  values to spec tests.

  * doc-src/SNS/V20100331.yml, lib/aws/api_config/SNS-2010-03-31.yml: Update
  AWS::SNS::Client API to latest version.

  SNS now supports mobile push.

  * doc-src/Redshift/V20121201.yml,
  lib/aws/api_config/Redshift-2012-12-01.yml: API updates for Amazon Redshift.

  Adds cluster snapshot identifiers to CopyClusterSnapshot and
  DeleteClusterSnapshot. Enables better status reporting for
  restoring from snapshots.

  * lib/aws/api_config/EMR-2009-03-31.yml, lib/aws/emr/client.rb,
  lib/aws/emr/request.rb: Updated EMR to use SigV4 and AWS JSON protocol.

  S3::Client#get_object with exclusive Range

  Fixes #326

2013-08-01 Anatoly Mikhailov <mikhailov.anatoly@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/rails.rb: Make possible to use without ActionMailer

  I use aws-sdk with background uploading queue, so it makes sense to turn off
  any unused Rails libraries. It's possible to turn off every Rails specific
  libraries except ActionMailer, so it works:


  ```ruby
  config.frameworks -= [ :active_record, :active_resource, :action_controller,
  :action_view]
  ```

  But it doesn't work

  ```ruby
  config.frameworks -= [:action_mailer]
  ```

  The fix makes sure that you load ActionMailer to use it with SNS
2013-07-30 Alex Wood <awood45@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/core/configuration.rb: Update AWS::Core::Configuration
  documentation.

  Document the verify_response_body_content_length parameter.

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db.rb: Update AWS::DynamoDB documentation example.

  Example of table creation in docs did not work, added missing
  parameters.

  * lib/aws/core/configuration.rb, lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb,
  spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb: Verify content-length for
  Net::HTTP responses.

  Some downloads from Amazon S3 can be truncated, and Net::HTTP
  does not check response body size against the content-length
  specified in the response header. This change adds such a check,
  which can be toggled on or off (on by default) in the AWS.config.

  * lib/aws/sns/message.rb: Add accessors for Token and SubscribeURL

  * lib/aws/sns/message.rb: Support SubscriptionConfirmation and
  UnsubscribeConfirmation messages

  * spec/shared/aws_client_examples.rb: Disabed aync test.

  * lib/aws/s3/client.rb, spec/aws/s3/client_spec.rb:
  AWS::S3::Client#put_bucket_website now omits empty routing rules.

  This resolves an issue where passing `:routing_rules => []` to the

  not accept `<RoutingRules/>`.

  Fixes #308

  * lib/aws/core.rb: Update documentation for AWS.memoize.

  * lib/aws/record/abstract_base.rb, lib/aws/record/attributes.rb,
  spec/aws/record/model/instance_methods_spec.rb,
  spec/shared/record/instance_examples.rb: AWS::Record now accepts default
  values set via a proc.

  By using a Proc, you can ensure every record has a different default value.
  For example:

      class Book < AWS::Record::HashModel
        string_attr :isbn, :default_value => lambda {
  SecureRandom.uuid }
      end

  * lib/aws/record/abstract_base.rb, lib/aws/record/hash_model.rb,
  lib/aws/record/validator.rb,
  spec/aws/record/hash_model/class_methods_spec.rb: AWS::Record::HashModel now
  accepts mutable hash keys.

  The default behavior for a class extending `AWS::Record::HashModel` is to
  have a managed `#id` attribute.  This attribute is auto-generated before
  creation.  It is set to a random UUID.

  You can now override this behavior with the `:hash_key` option.  When you do
  this,
  the HashModel's hash key will no longer be managed (no default values).

  * lib/aws/record/abstract_base.rb, lib/aws/record/model.rb: Moved the static
  #id attribute logic from AWS::Record::AbstractBase into Model.

  In order to allow a dynamic hash key, we don't want the extra baggage of
  a fixed attribute name.

  * bin/aws-rb: Added a -e option to aws-rb.

  You can now execute commands using aws-rb.  Passing commands
  with the -e option will prevent the REPL from launching and will
  exit instead.  You can pass multiple -e options.

      aws-rb -q -e "puts AWS.s3.buckets.map(&:name)"

  then exit.  The -q flag (quiet) disables logging.

  * lib/aws/s3/presigned_post.rb: Minor adjustment to previous presigned post
  change.

  Had integration test regressions regarding some option types.
  This change addresses that regression.

  * lib/aws/s3/presigned_post.rb, spec/aws/s3/presigned_post_spec.rb: Allow
  arbitrary options for presigned post.

  Presigned Posts to S3 previously hard coded a set of allowable
  parameters, this change permits users to send arbitrary params
  which are then passed on to S3.

  Resolves #250

  * lib/aws/core.rb, lib/aws/core/region.rb, tasks/docs.rake: Updated
  documentation for service helpers.

  * lib/aws/core.rb, lib/aws/core/configuration.rb, lib/aws/core/region.rb,
  tasks/docs.rake: Renamed helper methods for AWS::SimpleEmailService and
  AWS::SimpleWorkflow.

  To be consistent with other services that use the official service
  abbreviation,
  the helper methods on `AWS` and `AWS::Core::Region` now use the short names
  for
  `AWS::SimpleEmailService` and `AWS::SimpleWorkflow`.

      # new methods
      AWS.ses
      AWS.swf
      AWS.regions['us-west-2'].ses
      AWS.regions['us-west-2'].swf

      # deprecated methods
      AWS.simple_email_service
      AWS.simple_workflow
      AWS.regions['us-west-2'].simple_email_service
      AWS.regions['us-west-2'].simple_workflow

  Additionally global configuration options use the short name.

      AWS.config(:ses => {...})
      AWS.config(:swf => {...})

  * lib/aws/core/configuration.rb, spec/aws/core/client_spec.rb: You can now
  specify endpoint, region and port per service via AWS.config(:svc => { ...
  })

  You can specify global options per service now using the new configuration
  options.
  Example:

      AWS.config(:s3 => { :region => 'us-west-2' })

      AWS::S3.new.config.s3_region
      #=> 'us-west-2'

  * lib/aws/core/configuration.rb, spec/aws/config_spec.rb: Each service now
  hash a top-level configuration entry.

  Each service now has a config option, for example:

      AWS.config.s3
      #=> {}

  You can specify the value like any other configuration option:

      AWS.config(:s3 => { 'abc' => 'xyz' })

  These values are not yet used anywhere.  They will eventually
  be merged with the root level configuration options when building
  a client.

  * lib/aws/route_53/resource_record_set.rb: Don't nuke attributes on
  ResourceRecordSet update

  Previously, if you were not changing the name, type, or set identifier, they
  would be destructively removed from the ResourceRecordSet on update.

  * lib/aws/route_53/resource_record_set.rb: Add failover and health check
  attributes

  * features/sns/message.feature, features/sqs/step_definitions/messages.rb:
  Added integration tests for AWS::SNS::Message#authentic?

  * spec/aws/sns/message_spec.rb: Made the pending test for
  AWS::SNS::Message#authentic? pass.

  return.

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db/client.rb, spec/aws/dynamo_db/client_versions_spec.rb:
  You can now configure a global default API version.

  If you want to specify the default API version, you can do so
  using AWS.config:

      # normally defaults to 2011-12-05
      AWS::DynamoDB::Client.new
      #=> AWS::DyanmoDB::Client::V20111205

      AWS.config(:dynamo_db => { :api_version => '2012-08-10')

      # now defaults to 2012-08-10
      AWS::DynamoDB::Client.new
      #=> AWS::DyanmoDB::Client::V20120810

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db/client.rb, spec/aws/dynamo_db/client_versions_spec.rb:
  Fixed an issue constructing clients from their versioned class.

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db/client.rb: Documented the DynamoDB client with
  instructions on using the :api_version option.

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db/client.rb, lib/aws/dynamo_db/client/v20111205.rb,
  lib/aws/dynamo_db/client/v20120810.rb: Added documentation to the versioned
  DynamoDB::Clients.

  * lib/aws/core/client.rb, lib/aws/dynamo_db/client.rb,
  lib/aws/dynamo_db/client/v20111205.rb,
  lib/aws/dynamo_db/client/v20120810.rb, lib/aws/dynamo_db/client_base.rb,
  lib/aws/dynamo_db/client_v2.rb, spec/aws/dynamo_db/client_versions_spec.rb:
  AWS::DynamoDB::Client now supports both Amazon DynamoDB API versions.

  `AWS::DynamoDB::ClientV2` is now deprecated.  Instead of using this class,
  you can
  construct a client of a specific version like so:

      ddb = AWS::DynamoDB::Client.new(:api_version => '2012-08-10')

  Constructing a client without an API version returns a client of the oldest
  version.  This ensures existing users of AWS::DynamoDB::Client will not
  experience
  runtime errors from the differences.

  This works by turning AWS::DynamoDB::Client.new into a factory method.  It
  returns
  an instance of Client::V20111005 or Client::V20120810 based on the
  :api_version
  option.

  * spec/aws/config_spec.rb, spec/aws/core/client_spec.rb,
  spec/aws/core/region_spec.rb: Updated specs to use the new AWS::SERVICES
  format.

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db/client.rb, lib/aws/dynamo_db/client_v2.rb: Updated
  client API documentation for both Amazon DynamoDB clients.

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db/client.rb: Added whitespace in client documentation to
  ensure nested lists render correctly.

  * lib/aws/record/hash_model.rb, spec/aws/record/hash_model_spec.rb: Fix bug
  with hash_key

  * lib/aws/record/hash_model.rb: Allow setting hash_key

  When creating the dynamo_db_table instance the hash_key defaults to id.
  This patch allows assigning a string attribute as the id.

  * spec/aws/record/hash_model_spec.rb: Allow setting hash_key to values other
  than id

  * lib/aws/core.rb: add AWS.reset_memoization method

  * lib/aws/sns/message.rb, spec/aws/sns/message_spec.rb:
  AWS::SNS::Message#authentic? no longer flattens errors.

  Errors raised when trying to validate the SNS message were
  getting replaced with a generic message and a StandardError.
  If it fails 3 times, the original error will now raise through.

  * lib/aws/sns/message.rb: Resolved an issue with AWS::SNS::Mesage and Ruby
  versions < 2.0.

2013-06-27 Gustav Munkby <grddev@gmail.com>

  * spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb: Pending specs for more
  reasonable streaming behaviour

  Previously, errors in subsequent chunks were caught and then the whole
  request was retried, yielding (possibly) repeated chunks to the
  read_block, without any indication (in the block) of this being done.

  The outer client method would also not report any errors for a consumer
  to check.

  * spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb: Add specs for streaming http
  responses

2013-07-02 Trevor Rowe <trevorrowe@gmail.com>

  * spec/aws_spec.rb: Updated unit tests to not rely on return value from
  `eager_autoload!`.

  * Gemfile: Use HTTPS when talking to rubygems.org.

  * lib/aws/route_53/change_batch.rb: Expose failover + health check id in
  ChangeRequest

  * lib/aws/core.rb, spec/require_test_3.rb: Reverted the return value from
  AWS.eager_autoload!

  * lib/aws/iam/virtual_mfa_device.rb,
  spec/aws/iam/virtual_mfa_device_spec.rb: Resolved an issue with
  AWS::IAM::VirtualMFADevice#enable.

  Passing in string values for a code like '099999' were raising
  runtime errors from sprintf.  This change prevents string values
  from getting passed through sprintf.  Added a test to cover this
  behavior.

  Fixes #288

  * lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb,
  spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb: Capture OpenSSL errors, to

  Dimensions were getting lost before being passed to #filter.
  Added specs for this feature as well.

  Fixes #286.

  * lib/aws/core/http/curb_handler.rb: Curb Performance: Use an array of
  strings instead of a StringIO object.

  * lib/aws/core/http/curb_handler.rb: Remove Request#proxy_uri references
  from CurbHandler. #proxy_uri is no longer defined on Request

2013-06-26 Gustav Munkby <grddev@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb: Change HTTP handler to whitelist
  network errors

  Instead of (dangerously) whitelisting errors to reraise, this changes
  the HTTP handler to explicitly list the raised exceptions for which the
  exceptions should be swallowed.

  Fundamentally, this changes handling of unknown errors (such as any Java
  error in JRuby) to not be swallowed.

  * lib/aws/simple_email_service.rb, spec/aws/simple_email_service_spec.rb:
  Added test for setting message id on raw messages.

  When calling `AWS::SimpleEmailService#send_raw_message` with an
  object that responds to `#message_id=`, then the message ID
  from the SES response will be set on the raw message.

  Added a missing test and corrected the `#responds_to?` check.

  for users unable to use us-east-1a

  Some AWS users cannot access the AZ us-east-1a, making them
  unable to run our full Cucumber test suite. This change
  removes us-east-1a from the Cucumber integration tests, replacing
  with us-east-1b or other AZs as appropriate.

  * features/auto_scaling/step_definitions/groups.rb,
  lib/aws/auto_scaling/group_options.rb,
  spec/aws/auto_scaling/group_collection_spec.rb: Add termination_options to
  Auto Scaling group creation.

  Includes documentation of the parameter, integration
  tests, and a spec test.

  lib/aws/s3/object_collection.rb, spec/aws/s3/object_collection_spec.rb,
  spec/shared/s3/paginated_collection_examples.rb: Fixed issue with pagination
  in S3.

  The next_markers method in object_collection.rb for S3 did not reference the
  "next_marker" property, causing issues when the contents.last value was
  missing.

  Added Cucumber/RSpec tests to cover this case, added a check for next_marker
  to object_collection.rb, and refactored the marker selection logic to be
  more
  readable.

  Updated a few specs that were failing when run directly.

  * spec/require_test_1.rb, spec/require_test_2.rb, tasks/rspec.rake: Added
  addition tests around loading the SDK.

  Because the SDK uses autoload, it is necessary to run these
  tests in separate processes.

  * lib/aws/ec2/instance.rb, spec/aws/ec2/instance_spec.rb: Resolved an issue
  with AWS::EC2::Instance#console_output

  When the output xml element is missing from the response to
  GetConsoleOutput then this method was raising an error.  This
  now returns +nil+ indicating the output is not available.

2013-06-12 Trevor Rowe <trevorrowe@gmail.com>

  * aws-sdk.gemspec, bin/aws-rb, bin/aws-sdk-repl: Renamed the aws-sdk-repl to
  aws-rb.

  * Renamed the script
  * Updated the gem specification executables
  * Renamed the ENV prefix from AWS_SDK_REPL to AWSRB

  * bin/aws-sdk-repl: Changed the usage banner to match the (current)
  executable name.

  * bin/aws-sdk-repl: Modified the repl include and require options.

  * Now requiring the aws-sdk gem after the $LOAD_PATH
    has been amended.  This allows the user to point
    the repl to a different version of the SDK.

  * Now requiring any files specified via -r. This happens
    after the SDK has been loaded and configured.  This
    alows the required library to make use of the SDK.

  * bin/aws-sdk-repl: Corrected spelling error in comment.

  * .gitignore, Gemfile, aws-sdk.gemspec, bin/aws-sdk-repl: Added a basic repl
  executable as aws-sdk-repl.

  This repl will default to pry when available, but will
  fall back to irb when not available.  It accepts a number
  of runtime configuration options and defaults can be exported
  to ENV.

  By default client requests are logged (in color).  A quick
  example:

      aws-sdk-repl
      AWS> s3.buckets['aws-sdk'].objects['key'].content_length
      [AWS S3 200 0.875184 0 retries]
  head_object(:bucket_name=>"aws-sdk",:key=>"key")
      => 5242881

  You can use all methods of the AWS module directly when using Pry.

      AWS.config(:dynamo_db_crc_32_check => false) # oops, wont apply

      AWS::DynamoDB # autoload dynamo db service interface

  The S3 signature requries the content-md5 and content-type headers to be
  signed.  The #url_for helper method previously did not accept these two
  values and therefore was only good for requests where these values
  were not specified.

  You can now specify them like so:

      s3.buckets['bucket-name'].objects['key'].url_for(:write, {
        # both of these are optional
        :content_type => 'text/plain',

  Resolved an issue where `AWS::S3::MultipartUpload#complete` would only
  send the first 1k parts in the request to complete the upload.  This
  only happened when the `:remote_parts` flag was set.

  * lib/aws/core/client.rb, lib/aws/core/http/request.rb,
  lib/aws/simple_workflow/client.rb, lib/aws/simple_workflow/request.rb:
  Simplified how http read timeouts are handled.

  Deprecated #default_read_timeout on AWS::Core::Http::Request.
  SWF is the only service that (currently) needs to modify
  the read timeout (for long polling operations).  Now using
  the #read_timeout attribute exclusively to deal with this.

  * lib/aws/cloud_watch.rb: fix interface name in documentation

2013-04-24 Trevor Rowe <trevorrowe@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/core.rb, tasks/apis.rake: Added a rake task that lists the
  supported API versions.

  * aws-sdk.gemspec: Fixed the gemspec (was referencing README.rdoc which is
  now README.md).

  * ChangeLog, lib/aws/version.rb: Bump version to 1.9.2

  * lib/aws/core/deprecations.rb: Deprecated methods now only issue a single
  warning instead of one per call.

  * lib/aws/ec2/subnet.rb: Fixed an issue with
  AWS::EC2::Subnet#network_acl_association

  The #network_acl_association had a bug that caused it to always
  return the first association from the vpc the subnet belongs to.

2013-04-23 Trevor Rowe <trevorrowe@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/core/client.rb: Deprecated AWS::Core::Client#http_read_timeout.

  The #http_read_timeout is a property of the configuration
  and is not consumed by the client.  It should instead
  be retrieved from the client configuration is needed.
  Example:

      # given
      ec2 = AWS::EC2::Client.new

      # deprecated
      ec2.http_read_timeout

      # prefered
      ec2.config.http_read_timeout

  * lib/aws/core.rb, lib/aws/core/deprecations.rb: Added a module for marking
  methods as deprecated.

  spec/aws/core/region_spec.rb: Fixed a few test issues with the new service
  shortcuts.

  * lib/aws/core.rb, tasks/docs.rake: Added service shortcuts from AWS.

  You can now create service interfaces directly from AWS like so:

      ec2 = AWS.ec2

  You can pass configuration options to this instance as well:

      ec2 = AWS.ec2(:region => 'us-west-2')

  Updated docs rake task to document these magic methods.

  * README.md: Updated README examples.

  * lib/aws/core.rb, tasks/docs.rake: Added additional rake tasks for updating
  docs.

  The API documentation contains lists of supported
  services and service classes.  A pair of rake tasks
  have been added that will update these lists when
  docs are built to ensure they do not get stale.

  * README.md, README.rdoc: Translated README from rdoc to markdown,
  restructured content.

  with a `responds_to?` check.

  spec/net/http/connection_pool/session_spec.rb,
  spec/net/http/connection_pool_spec.rb, spec/shared/aws_client_examples.rb:
  Simplified the connection pool and addressed a few issues.

  The default http handler (AWS::Core::Http::NetHttpHandler) used
  internally a Net::Http::ConnectionPool class.  This was refactored
  (and renamed to AWS::Core::Http::ConnectionPool).

  * ConnectionPool.new will now return a previously build (shared)
    pool for the same options.

  * ConnectionPool.new now tracks all pools, and you can get a list
    of them from ConnectionPool.pools.

  * Moved Net::HTTP patch into aws/core/http/patch (this fixes
    100-continue bug in 1.9.3 and 2.0.0)

  As part of this refactor a handful of configuration options were
  removed from AWS::Core::Http::Request (e.g. ssl_ca_file, proxy_uri,
  etc).  These attributes are now passed to the ConnectionPool
  constructor instead and not tracked on each http request.

  * spec/aws/s3/client_spec.rb: Fixed xml matching in S3 client spec.

  * lib/aws/rails.rb: Simplified Rails version detection.

  * lib/aws/s3/client.rb: Now using Nokogiri::XML::Builder instead of REXML in
  AWS::S3::Client.

  Converted a few final locations in the S3 client that built XML
  incorrectly using REXML (now using the nokogiri xml builder).  These
  locations did not correctly escape xml values in all situations.

  Fixes #118

  * features/cloud_front/client.feature,
  features/cloud_front/step_definitions/client.rb,
  lib/aws/cloud_front/request.rb: Added support for session credentials to
  AWS::CloudFront.

  The AWS::CloudFront::Request class was ignoring session
  tokens when signing the request.  This caused Cloud Front
  to return cyrptic errors.  Now setting the 'x-amz-session-token'
  header when the credentials contain a session token.

  Fixes #227

  * lib/aws/ec2/instance_collection.rb,
  spec/aws/ec2/instance_collection_spec.rb:
  AWS::EC2::InstanceCollection#create now accepts :block_device_mappings in
  the same format aws AWS::EC2::Client#run_instances.

  Previously it expected a hash option and then it would
  create the array of hashes required by #run_instances.  It
  now only translates when a hash is given and it passes arrays
  along un-modified.

  Fixes #210

  * lib/aws/api_config/CloudFront-2012-07-01.yml,
  lib/aws/cloud_front/client.rb: Updated AWS::CloudFront::Client to the
  2012-07-01 api version.

  spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb: Added support for sending
  "expect" and waiting for 100-continue.

  Added two new configuration options to AWS.config:

  * :http_continue_timeout (time in seconds, defaults to 1)
  * :http_continue_threshold (size in bytes, defaults false)

  If a request body exceeds the :http_continue_threshold, then the
  "Expect" header will be set to "100-continue".  The http client will
  then wait for a "100 Continue" response or :http_continue_timeout
  seconds before sending the body.

  By default the :http_continue_timeout is set to 1 seconds and the
  :http_continue_threshold is disabled (set to false).

  To enable 100-continues you need to do 2 things:

  * Call `AWS.patch_net_http_100_continue!`
  * Set `:http_continue_threshold` to a positive integer (number of bytes)

  The individual configuration options for each service endpoints are
  now deprecated.  If you want to override the endpoint for a service
  you can do so in the constructor:

      # this also works

  Also, in update(), don't clear out @create_options until after the
  change batch is actually called. Otherwise the object's state will be
  mutated even if the batch raises for some reason.

  * lib/aws/s3/client.rb: Patch for missing obj restore expiry date in s3 head
  response

2013-02-06 Trevor Rowe <trevorrowe@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/cloud_formation/stack.rb: Corrected the documentation on the
  return type of AWS::CloudFormation::Stack#status.

  Fixes #141

  * lib/aws/s3/s3_object.rb, spec/aws/s3/s3_object_spec.rb:
  AWS::S3::S3Object#read now returns the extra response in block mode.

  You can now get the object contents AND the object metadata in a single
  call to S3Object#read.

      obj = s3.buckets['foo'].objects['bar']

      resp = obj.read do |chunk|
        # write the data somewhere
        file.write(chunk)
      end

      resp[:etag] #=> '...'
      resp[:meta] #=> a hash of object metadata

  * lib/aws/core/http/curb_handler.rb: Added support to the CurbHandler for
  streaming reads.

  The AWS::Core::Http::CurbHandler is a drop-in replacement for the
  net/http based default handler.  The curb-based handler did not
  previously support a block for streading response data from the
  response directly.  Instead it was buffering the entire response
  into memory (and emitting a warning).

  * lib/aws/s3/s3_object.rb: Adding doc for content_md5

  * spec/aws/s3/s3_object_spec.rb, spec/shared/aws_client_examples.rb: Updated
  specs to reflect the client now raises the actual error instead of a
  NetworkError.

  * lib/aws/core/client.rb, lib/aws/s3/client.rb,
  spec/aws/s3/multipart_upload_spec.rb: Fixed an issue with the stubbed
  responses for S3::Client#complete_multipart_upload.

  A number of tests that should have failed were passing because the
  simulate response for #complete_multipart upload was puttin in a nil
  value for :version_id.  The version id actually should only be present
  when not-nil.

  * lib/aws/s3/multipart_upload.rb: Fix undefined method 'version_id' during
  multipart upload

  * lib/aws/core/credential_providers.rb,
  spec/aws/core/credential_providers_spec.rb: Fix bug: default credential
  provider hides sub credential provider's fetching
  credentials error.

  The default credential provider will try to rescue sub provider's
  MissingCredentialsError for looking up the right credential provider.
  However, the way using 'rescue' keyword is not correct, and it
  actually rescued all the StandardError raised from sub provider's
  credentials method.

  * lib/aws/core/credential_providers.rb: missing require time lib for
  Time.parse is used in EC2Provider, the test passed because there is an
  example required the time lib

  * Gemfile, lib/aws/core.rb, lib/aws/core/http/httparty_handler.rb,
  spec/aws/core/http/httparty_handler_spec.rb: Removed gem dependency on

  The AWS::Core::Http::HTTPartyHandler has long since been replaced
  as the default handler.  This commit removes the gem dependency
  on HTTParty and removes the handler.

  * Gemfile, features/support/common.rb: Removed a few un-needed test

  * lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb: Fixed spec broken by NetHttpHandler
  update for network errors.

  Ruby 1.8 extends Timeout::Errors from SingalError instead of StandardError.
  A recent commit (bcd98dbc579e9d520dadffe9911c64743a4ce082) caused
  SignalErrors to get passed through.  We are now catching Timeout::Error
  before this, so they can be treated as network errors and retried.

  * lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb, lib/aws/core/http/response.rb,
  spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb:
  AWS::Core::Http::Response#network_error now returns the error instead of a
  boolean.

  The #network_error? method still returns true/false values, but
  the #network_error method now returns the raised error object or nil.

  * lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb,
  spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb: Increased the number of Errors
  retried by the NetHttpHandler.

  Previously, only a short white-list of errors were trapped and
  retried as networking errors.  This has been expanded to be
  all errors raised from the handler (and Net::HTTP) except for
  those on a pass-through list.  This should minimize the number of
  un-enuemrated errors that don't get retried (like open ssl socket
  errors).

  from the http response headers.  Simplified parsing responses
  for a number of object methods (GET, HEAD, PUT, etc).

  * lib/aws/core/rest_response_parser.rb, spec/aws/glacier/client_spec.rb:

  where #client had a miss-configured ec2 endpoint.

  EC2 regions provide access to resources in other regions, e.g.

    ec2.regions['us-west-2'].instances.map(&:id)

  There was an issue where all EC2 service methods were correctly proxied
  to the new region *except* for the #client.  Here is a demonstration of
  that bug:

    ec2.regions['us-west-2'].client.config.ec2_endpoint
    #=> 'ec2.amazonaws.com'

  This should have returned 'ec2.us-west-2.amazonaws.com'.  This patch
  resolves this issue and updates a few incorrect tests.

  features/sqs/step_definitions/messages.rb, lib/aws/sqs/queue.rb,
  spec/aws/sqs/queue_spec.rb: Implement SQS long polling

  Changes within AWS::SQS:

  * Queue#poll now accept a :wait_time_seconds parameter which sets the
    maximum amount of time that SQS should long poll for.
    Defaults to 15 seconds. To use the default set for all messages
    on the queue, pass in nil.
  * The :wait_time_seconds default does not apply to
    Queue#receive_message. For this method, you must pass the option
    directly, or set the global Queue#wait_time_seconds long polling
    value.
  * Added Queue#wait_time_seconds attribute to set the queue-wide
    long poll timeout value. This setting applies to all calls to
    Queue#receive_message or Queue#poll
  * Deprecates the Queue::DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL constant
  * Queue#poll no longer uses :poll_interval; use :wait_time_seconds
    instead.

2012-07-26 Peter Mounce <pete@neverrunwithscissors.com>

  * lib/aws/sns/message.rb, lib/aws/sns/originators/from_auto_scaling.rb,
  spec/aws/sns/originators/from_auto_scaling_spec.rb,
  spec/aws/sns/support/sns_as_instance_launch.json,
  spec/aws/sns/support/sns_as_instance_terminate.json: Add support for Message
  finding out its own origin.

  Introduce the concept of a message's origin, and introduce a partial
  implementation of
  an AutoScaling originator (partial, in that there's not coverage for all of
  the data that
  auto-scaling will include in the SNS' body).

  The origin-selection currently works simply; there's only one originator at
  present, so
  it's checked in-line in Message's initializer, rather than that iterating
  through the
  available originator modules.

  * lib/aws/sns.rb, lib/aws/sns/message.rb, spec/aws/sns/message_spec.rb,
  spec/aws/sns/support/sns_manually_sent.json: Add AWS::SNS::Message and
  build-in authenticity-checking.

  AWS::SNS::Message#authentic? will return true if the message is
  cryptographically authenticated
  (see
  http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/sns/latest/gsg/SendMessageToHttp.verify.si
  gnature.html).
  To-do:
  * support subscription-confirmation and unsubscribe messages; this just
  supports
  notifications.  Should just mean changes to canonical_string method.
  * decide whether it's really OK to return false in the event of the check
  throwing an error (for
  example, if the cert-download fails too often or times out).  Might be best
  to leave that up to
  the caller?
