  Added support for Route53 health check operations.

  * lib/aws/ec2/instance.rb: Added a mutable #ebs_optimized attribute to
  AWS::EC2::Instance.

  * lib/aws/ec2/instance.rb, spec/aws/ec2/instance_spec.rb: Resolved an issue
  with Instance#block_device_mappings and ephemeral volumes.

  AWS::EC2::Instance#block_device_mappings was raising runtime errors if the
  instance had any ephemeral volumes.  These are now filtered.  The method has
  also be renamed to Instance#attachments (aliased to the old name).

  Added Instance#block_devices which now returns all of the block devices
  as a simple array of hashes.

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db/attribute_collection.rb,
  spec/aws/dynamo_db/attribute_collection_spec.rb: Renamed
  AWS::DynamoDB::AttributeCollection#to_h to #to_hash.

  DeleteDistribution and DeleteStreamingDistribution - CloudFront

2013-02-08 Andy Brody <andy@stripe.com>

  * lib/aws/route_53/resource_record_set.rb: Add some documentation.

  * lib/aws/route_53/resource_record_set.rb: Factor out ChangeRequest creation
  into methods.

  This makes it easier to create more complex change batches that
  encompass the deletion or update of multiple resource record sets.

  Also, in update(), don't clear out @create_options until after the
  change batch is actually called. Otherwise the object's state will be
  mutated even if the batch raises for some reason.

2013-02-07 Andy Choi <chunkerchunker@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/s3/client.rb: Patch for missing obj restore expiry date in s3 head
  response

2013-02-06 Trevor Rowe <trevorrowe@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/cloud_formation/stack.rb: Corrected the documentation on the
  return type of AWS::CloudFormation::Stack#status.

  Fixes #141

  * lib/aws/s3/s3_object.rb, spec/aws/s3/s3_object_spec.rb:
  AWS::S3::S3Object#read now returns the extra response in block mode.

  You can now get the object contents AND the object metadata in a single
  call to S3Object#read.

      obj = s3.buckets['foo'].objects['bar']

      resp = obj.read do |chunk|
        # write the data somewhere
        file.write(chunk)
      end

      resp[:etag] #=> '...'
      resp[:meta] #=> a hash of object metadata

2013-02-05 Trevor Rowe <trevorrowe@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/core/http/curb_handler.rb: Added support to the CurbHandler for
  streaming reads.

  The AWS::Core::Http::CurbHandler is a drop-in replacement for the
  net/http based default handler.  The curb-based handler did not
  previously support a block for streading response data from the
  response directly.  Instead it was buffering the entire response
  into memory (and emitting a warning).

2013-02-01 Trevor Rowe <trevorrowe@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/s3/s3_object.rb, spec/aws/s3/s3_object_encrypt_spec.rb: Fixed a

  * spec/aws/s3/s3_object_spec.rb, spec/shared/aws_client_examples.rb: Updated
  specs to reflect the client now raises the actual error instead of a
  NetworkError.

  * lib/aws/core/client.rb, lib/aws/s3/client.rb,
  spec/aws/s3/multipart_upload_spec.rb: Fixed an issue with the stubbed
  responses for S3::Client#complete_multipart_upload.

  A number of tests that should have failed were passing because the
  simulate response for #complete_multipart upload was puttin in a nil
  value for :version_id.  The version id actually should only be present
  when not-nil.

  * lib/aws/s3/multipart_upload.rb: Fix undefined method 'version_id' during
  multipart upload

  * lib/aws/core/credential_providers.rb,
  spec/aws/core/credential_providers_spec.rb: Fix bug: default credential
  provider hides sub credential provider's fetching
  credentials error.

  The default credential provider will try to rescue sub provider's
  MissingCredentialsError for looking up the right credential provider.
  However, the way using 'rescue' keyword is not correct, and it
  actually rescued all the StandardError raised from sub provider's
  credentials method.

  * lib/aws/core/credential_providers.rb: missing require time lib for
  Time.parse is used in EC2Provider, the test passed because there is an
  example required the time lib

  * Gemfile, features/support/common.rb: Removed a few un-needed test

  * lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb: Fixed spec broken by NetHttpHandler
  update for network errors.

  Ruby 1.8 extends Timeout::Errors from SingalError instead of StandardError.
  A recent commit (bcd98dbc579e9d520dadffe9911c64743a4ce082) caused
  SignalErrors to get passed through.  We are now catching Timeout::Error
  before this, so they can be treated as network errors and retried.

  * lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb, lib/aws/core/http/response.rb,
  spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb:
  AWS::Core::Http::Response#network_error now returns the error instead of a
  boolean.

  The #network_error? method still returns true/false values, but
  the #network_error method now returns the raised error object or nil.

  * lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb,
  spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb: Increased the number of Errors
  retried by the NetHttpHandler.

  Previously, only a short white-list of errors were trapped and
  retried as networking errors.  This has been expanded to be
  all errors raised from the handler (and Net::HTTP) except for
  those on a pass-through list.  This should minimize the number of
  un-enuemrated errors that don't get retried (like open ssl socket
  errors).

  Also DRY'd up parsing responses for s3 object methods,
  created a single method that extracts s3 object information
  from the http response headers.  Simplified parsing responses
  for a number of object methods (GET, HEAD, PUT, etc).

  * lib/aws/core/rest_response_parser.rb, spec/aws/glacier/client_spec.rb:

  where #client had a miss-configured ec2 endpoint.

  EC2 regions provide access to resources in other regions, e.g.

    ec2.regions['us-west-2'].instances.map(&:id)

  There was an issue where all EC2 service methods were correctly proxied
  to the new region *except* for the #client.  Here is a demonstration of
  that bug:

    ec2.regions['us-west-2'].client.config.ec2_endpoint
    #=> 'ec2.amazonaws.com'

  This should have returned 'ec2.us-west-2.amazonaws.com'.  This patch
  resolves this issue and updates a few incorrect tests.

2012-10-05 Neville Kadwa <neville@kadwa.com>

  * lib/aws/api_config/EMR-2009-03-31.yml: EMR added set_visible_to_all_users
  call, expose this through client

  * lib/aws/api_config/EMR-2009-03-31.yml, lib/aws/emr/job_flow.rb,
  spec/aws/emr/job_flow_spec.rb: EMR added set_visible_to_all_users call,
  expose this through client

  * lib/aws.rb, lib/aws/core.rb, lib/aws/core/configuration.rb: Documented
  Cloud Search configurations and added autoloading hooks.

  * lib/aws/cloud_search/client.rb: Documented AWS::CloudSearch::Client
  control plane operations.

  * lib/aws/cloud_search.rb, lib/aws/cloud_search/client.rb,
  lib/aws/cloud_search/config.rb, lib/aws/cloud_search/errors.rb,
  lib/aws/cloud_search/request.rb: Added Cloud Search control plane API
  classes.

  * lib/aws/api_config/CloudSearch-2011-02-01.yml: Added Cloud Search API
  configuration file.

  * lib/aws/ec2/reserved_instances.rb,
  lib/aws/ec2/reserved_instances_offering.rb,

2013-01-03 xli <xli@thoughtworks.com>

  * lib/aws/core/credential_providers.rb,
  spec/aws/core/credential_providers_spec.rb: Do not cache credentials inside
  DefaultProvider as EC2Provider may
  refresh the credentials before security token is expired.

  * lib/aws/record/scope.rb: Remove warning, Enumerator.new without a blokc is
  deprecated

  use Object#to_enum

2013-01-02 Andy Brody <andy@stripe.com>

  * lib/aws/ec2/security_group.rb: Don't munge port ranges in
  (e/in)gress_opts, either.

  * .travis.yml: Disabling ruby 1.9.3 due to bug in latest patch level.

  * lib/aws/ec2/security_group/ip_permission.rb: Don't munge port ranges that
  are already Ranges.

  For ranges with first > last, Array(range) yields [], causing port_range
  to be set to 0..0. The API returns IpPermission objects with port_range
  set to things like 0..-1 or 8..-1 for specific ICMP packet types. These
  were previously impossible to create using IpPermission::new.

  It was also rather silly to be creating and immediately garbage
  collecting two arrays (e.g. for 0..65535) when we really want the range.

  * lib/aws/core/credential_providers.rb,
  spec/aws/core/credential_providers_spec.rb: refresh ec2 credentials if it
  will be expired in 5 min

  * lib/aws/s3/s3_object.rb: Fixed a broken S3Object spec.

  * lib/aws/core/credential_providers.rb,
  spec/aws/core/credential_providers_spec.rb: refresh ec2 credentials when it
  is expired

  * .gitignore: Added samples configuration file to .gitignore

  * samples/sqs/add_queue_message.rb: Reformated SQS sample and removed
  deprecated option usage from same sample.

  * lib/aws/sqs/queue.rb: Fixed typo in AWS::SQS::Queue#poll documentation.

  * samples/cloud_watch/alarm_with_custom_metrics.rb,
  samples/cloud_watch/create_delete_alarm.rb, samples/sns/publish.rb: Updated
  the attribution on a few samples.

  * features/support/common.rb: FIXED: Integration tests failed to load
  configuration file when credentials exist in ENV.

  * lib/aws/s3/client.rb, lib/aws/s3/s3_object.rb: Added :expires option to
  S3Object copy operations and S3Client#copy_object.

  Fixes #112

  Changes within AWS::SQS:

  * Queue#poll now accept a :wait_time_seconds parameter which sets the
    maximum amount of time that SQS should long poll for.
    Defaults to 15 seconds. To use the default set for all messages
    on the queue, pass in nil.
  * The :wait_time_seconds default does not apply to
    Queue#receive_message. For this method, you must pass the option
    directly, or set the global Queue#wait_time_seconds long polling
    value.
  * Added Queue#wait_time_seconds attribute to set the queue-wide
    long poll timeout value. This setting applies to all calls to
    Queue#receive_message or Queue#poll
  * Deprecates the Queue::DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL constant
  * Queue#poll no longer uses :poll_interval; use :wait_time_seconds
