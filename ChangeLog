  * Gemfile, lib/aws/core.rb, lib/aws/core/http/httparty_handler.rb,
  spec/aws/core/http/httparty_handler_spec.rb: Removed gem dependency on
  HTTParty.

  The AWS::Core::Http::HTTPartyHandler has long since been replaced
  as the default handler.  This commit removes the gem dependency
  on HTTParty and removes the handler.

  Removing deprecated usage of nested Given/When/Then from features.

  * Gemfile, features/support/common.rb: Removed a few un-needed test
  dependencies and updated others.

  * lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb: Fixed spec broken by NetHttpHandler
  update for network errors.

  Ruby 1.8 extends Timeout::Errors from SingalError instead of StandardError.
  A recent commit (bcd98dbc579e9d520dadffe9911c64743a4ce082) caused
  SignalErrors to get passed through.  We are now catching Timeout::Error
  before this, so they can be treated as network errors and retried.

  * lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb, lib/aws/core/http/response.rb,
  spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb:
  AWS::Core::Http::Response#network_error now returns the error instead of a
  boolean.

  The #network_error? method still returns true/false values, but
  the #network_error method now returns the raised error object or nil.

  * lib/aws/core/http/net_http_handler.rb,
  spec/aws/core/http/net_http_handler_spec.rb: Increased the number of Errors
  retried by the NetHttpHandler.

  Previously, only a short white-list of errors were trapped and
  retried as networking errors.  This has been expanded to be
  all errors raised from the handler (and Net::HTTP) except for
  those on a pass-through list.  This should minimize the number of
  un-enuemrated errors that don't get retried (like open ssl socket
  errors).

  * lib/aws/dynamo_db/item_collection.rb: Corrected documentation on
  AWS::DynamoDB::ItemCollection#select on how to :limit

  * spec/aws/simple_workflow/decision_task_spec.rb: Spec for allowing
  workflow_id parameters to some decider methods

  * lib/aws/simple_workflow/decision_task.rb: Allow
  signal_external_workflow_execution and
  request_cancel_external_workflow_execution to accept a String workflow id as
  the first parameter. This is consistent with the current documentation.

  * lib/aws/iam/resource.rb: Removed @private doc tag from AWS::IAM::Resource.

  This will cause the #exists? method to appear in the docs
  for the various IAM resource classes.

  Fixes #128.

  * lib/aws/record/abstract_base.rb, lib/aws/record/exceptions.rb,

  * lib/aws/s3/client.rb, lib/aws/s3/s3_object.rb, spec/aws/s3/client_spec.rb:
  Added support for website redirect location to S3 client.

  Also DRY'd up parsing responses for s3 object methods,
  created a single method that extracts s3 object information
  from the http response headers.  Simplified parsing responses
  for a number of object methods (GET, HEAD, PUT, etc).

  * lib/aws/core/rest_response_parser.rb, spec/aws/glacier/client_spec.rb:
  Added support for Glacier::Client#get_job_output.

  * lib/aws/glacier/archive_collection.rb: fixed description option for
  Glacier::ArchiveCollection.create

2013-01-18 Jamis Buck <jamis@37signals.com>

  * lib/aws/s3/client.rb, spec/aws/s3/client_spec.rb: don't look for

  spec/shared/ec2/collection_array_access_examples.rb,
  spec/shared/ec2/collection_examples.rb: Fixed a bug in AWS::EC2::Region
  where #client had a miss-configured ec2 endpoint.

  EC2 regions provide access to resources in other regions, e.g.

    ec2.regions['us-west-2'].instances.map(&:id)

  There was an issue where all EC2 service methods were correctly proxied
  to the new region *except* for the #client.  Here is a demonstration of
  that bug:

    ec2.regions['us-west-2'].client.config.ec2_endpoint
    #=> 'ec2.amazonaws.com'

  This should have returned 'ec2.us-west-2.amazonaws.com'.  This patch
  resolves this issue and updates a few incorrect tests.

  * samples/ec2/run_instance.rb: Updated EC2 example to use a less-aggressive
  polling delay for instance state change.

  * lib/aws/cloud_formation/stack.rb,

  * spec/aws/auto_scaling/group_collection_spec.rb: Removed test for require
  availability zones when creating auto scaling groups.

  The latest API update makes this param optional when using subnets.

  * lib/aws/api_config/CloudFormation-2010-05-15.yml,
  lib/aws/cloud_formation/client.rb: Updated AWS::CloudFormation::Client to
  support tags and next token.

  The DescribeStacks operation now paginates stacks after 20.  Updated the
  client to accept the new :next_token param.

  * lib/aws/elb/request.rb: Updated ELB to signature version 4.

  * lib/aws/api_config/AutoScaling-2011-01-01.yml,

2013-01-02 Andy Brody <andy@stripe.com>

  * lib/aws/ec2/security_group.rb: Don't munge port ranges in
  (e/in)gress_opts, either.

  * .travis.yml: Disabling ruby 1.9.3 due to bug in latest patch level.

  * lib/aws/ec2/security_group/ip_permission.rb: Don't munge port ranges that
  are already Ranges.

  For ranges with first > last, Array(range) yields [], causing port_range
  to be set to 0..0. The API returns IpPermission objects with port_range
  set to things like 0..-1 or 8..-1 for specific ICMP packet types. These
  were previously impossible to create using IpPermission::new.

  It was also rather silly to be creating and immediately garbage
  collecting two arrays (e.g. for 0..65535) when we really want the range.

  * lib/aws/core/credential_providers.rb,
  spec/aws/core/credential_providers_spec.rb: refresh ec2 credentials if it
  will be expired in 5 min

  * lib/aws/s3/s3_object.rb: Fixed a broken S3Object spec.

2013-01-01 Drew Blas <drew.blas@gmail.com>

  * lib/aws/s3.rb: Fix S3 doc example

  There was a duplicate each in L101 that caused this code example to break.
2012-12-21 Trevor Rowe <trevrowe@amazon.com>

  * lib/aws/data_pipeline/client.rb: Updated data pipeline documentation to
  show the correct return value hash keys.

  * lib/aws/cloud_search.rb, lib/aws/cloud_watch.rb: Added minor documentation
  to AWS::CloudSearch and AWS::CloudWatch.

2012-12-20 Trevor Rowe <trevrowe@amazon.com>

  * lib/aws/data_pipeline.rb, lib/aws/data_pipeline/client.rb,
  lib/aws/glacier.rb: Added minimal documentation for Glacier and Data
  Pipeline.

  * ChangeLog, lib/aws/version.rb: Bump version to 1.8.0

  * lib/aws-sdk.rb: Add missing require call to aws-sdk.rb

  * lib/aws/api_config/Glacier-2012-06-01.yml: Update attributions for Amazon
  Glacier

  * lib/aws.rb: Add missing newline to aws.rb

  * lib/aws-sdk.rb, lib/aws.rb: Flip aws.rb and aws-sdk.rb

  Makes it possible to workaround #37 by adding `-raws` to the Ruby
  process, ie.,

    ruby -raws <file.rb>

  or,

    bundle exec ruby -raws <file.rb>

  * Rakefile, tasks/cucumber.rake, tasks/docs.rake, tasks/rspec.rake,

  features/sqs/step_definitions/messages.rb, lib/aws/sqs/queue.rb,
  spec/aws/sqs/queue_spec.rb: Implement SQS long polling

  Changes within AWS::SQS:

  * Queue#poll now accept a :wait_time_seconds parameter which sets the
    maximum amount of time that SQS should long poll for.
    Defaults to 15 seconds. To use the default set for all messages
    on the queue, pass in nil.
  * The :wait_time_seconds default does not apply to
    Queue#receive_message. For this method, you must pass the option
    directly, or set the global Queue#wait_time_seconds long polling
    value.
  * Added Queue#wait_time_seconds attribute to set the queue-wide
    long poll timeout value. This setting applies to all calls to
    Queue#receive_message or Queue#poll
  * Deprecates the Queue::DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL constant
  * Queue#poll no longer uses :poll_interval; use :wait_time_seconds
    instead.
